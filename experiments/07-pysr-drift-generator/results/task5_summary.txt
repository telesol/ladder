Task 5 Results - Regime-Specific PySR for Lanes 0-6

## Summary

Lane   | Stable  | Moderate | Complex | Overall | H4      | Improvement
-------|---------|----------|---------|---------|---------|-------------
Lane 0 |   0.0%  |    0.0%  |   0.0%  |   0.0%  |  6.0%   |      -6.0%
Lane 1 |  22.2%  |   22.2%  |  22.2%  |  22.2%  | 71.0%   |     -48.8%
Lane 2 |  20.0%  |   20.0%  |  20.0%  |  20.0%  |  7.0%   |     +13.0%
Lane 3 |   0.0%  |    0.0%  |   0.0%  |   0.0%  | 21.0%   |     -21.0%
Lane 4 |  42.9%  |   42.9%  |  42.9%  |  42.9%  | 23.0%   |     +19.9%
Lane 5 |  40.0%  |   40.0%  |  40.0%  |  40.0%  | 10.0%   |     +30.0%
Lane 6 | 100.0%  |  100.0%  | 100.0%  | 100.0%  | 50.0%   |     +50.0%

Average improvement: +3.9%

## Conclusion: REGIME-SPECIFIC DOES NOT HELP

Key findings:
1. Regime separation provides ZERO improvement over global baseline (all three regime accuracies equal overall)
2. Simple mode-based baseline performs comparably to H4 recursive approach for lanes 2, 4-6
3. Lanes 0-3 remain very difficult (0-22% accuracy)
4. Lanes 4-6 show clear k=32 boundary (stable=0 before k32, chaos after)

## Regime Statistics

Stable (k<32):
- Lanes 0-3: Chaotic (81-100% transition rates)
- Lanes 4-6: Perfect (0% transition rate, 100% zeros)

Moderate (32≤k<64):
- All lanes: 45-100% transition rates
- Best: Lane 6 (45.8%)

Complex (k≥64):
- All lanes: 100% transition rate (complete chaos)

## Verdict

❌ REGIME-SPECIFIC HELPS: NO (0/7 lanes improved by regime separation)
✅ K=32 BOUNDARY DISCOVERED: YES (clear transition point for lanes 4-6)
✅ LANE 6 IS BEST: YES (100% test accuracy, lowest transition rates)

Recommendation: Focus on lanes 7-8 (82-92% in H4), use ensemble methods, accept that lanes 0-6 may be fundamentally unpredictable due to cryptographic drift properties.
