TASK: Find the formula for offset[n] in k[n] = 9*k[n-3] + offset[n]

KNOWN OFFSETS (n=63-71):
off[63] = -1,222,142,202,450,997,670
off[64] = 4,967,579,474,010,341,790
off[65] = -4,606,975,570,506,195,703
off[66] = -34,592,851,995,373,892,186
off[67] = -27,540,062,615,817,873,350
off[68] = -55,217,129,595,261,785,870
off[69] = -119,841,466,032,741,115,730
off[70] = -223,475,518,416,452,616,237
off[71] = -376,982,719,305,606,823,936 (derived)

OBSERVATIONS:
- Offsets grow roughly geometrically
- Sign pattern varies
- Some offsets divisible by m-values (9, 19, 23)

QUESTION: Find formula offset[n] = f(n, k, m) that reproduces these values.

Check if offset involves:
- k-value combinations
- m-sequence values  
- Prime index products
