Thinking...
First, I need to find k[71] based on the pattern discovered. From the verified findings, for n ≡ 1 mod 5, C(n) = 1/φ, meaning k[n]/2^n ≈ 1/φ. So for n=71, which is 71 ≡ 1 mod 5, we should have k[71]/2^71 ≈ 1/φ.

The key discovery shows that for n=13, k[13] = floor(1/φ × 2^13) + 22 × k[3]. Here, 22 is related to π, since 22/7 ≈ π. Also, n=13 is not necessarily ≡ 1 mod 5, but 13 mod 5 is 3, so it might be a different case. But for n≡1 mod 5, the pattern might be similar.

The user mentioned that for n≡1 mod 5, C(n)=1/φ, so perhaps the correction term is zero or something else. But in n=13, there was a correction term involving k[3].

I need to find a general formula for the correction term. The recurrence given is k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n], where m[n] is what we need to find.

From the sequence: k[1]=1, k[2]=3, k[3]=7, k[4]=8, k[5]=21, k[6]=49, k[7]=76, etc.

I should compute m[n] for small n to see a pattern.

From the recurrence: k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n], so m[n] = 2*k[n-1] + 2^n - k[n].

Let me calculate m[n] for n=2 to n=7.

For n=2: k[2]=3, k[1]=1, 2^2=4. So m[2] = 2*k[1] + 2^2 - k[2] = 2*1 + 4 - 3 = 2+4-3=3.

But m[2] should be an integer? 3 seems fine.

For n=3: k[3]=7, k[2]=3, 2^3=8. m[3] = 2*3 + 8 - 7 = 6+8-7=7.

For n=4: k[4]=8, k[3]=7, 2^4=16. m[4] = 2*7 + 16 - 8 = 14+16-8=22.

For n=5: k[5]=21, k[4]=8, 2^5=32. m[5] = 2*8 + 32 - 21 = 16+32-21=27.

For n=6: k[6]=49, k[5]=21, 2^6=64. m[6] = 2*21 + 64 - 49 = 42+64-49=57.

For n=7: k[7]=76, k[6]=49, 2^7=128. m[7] = 2*49 + 128 - 76 = 98+128-76=150.

So m[2]=3, m[3]=7, m[4]=22, m[5]=27, m[6]=57, m[7]=150.

Now, I need to find a pattern for m[n]. The key discovery involved k[3] and 22. Notice that m[4]=22, which is the same as the 22 used in the correction for n=13.

Also, for n=13, k[13] = floor(1/φ × 2^13) + 22 × k[3]. But from the recurrence, k[13] should be 2*k[12] + 2^13 - m[13]. So perhaps m[13] is related to 22 × k[3] or something.

In the formula for n=13, the correction term is added to the floor value. But in the recurrence, m[n] is subtracted. So it might be that for some n, k[n] is approximately floor(1/φ × 2^n) plus a correction, and m[n] is chosen to make that happen.

Perhaps m[n] is defined such that k[n] is close to 2^n / φ.

Another thought: from the verified findings, k[n]/2^n ≈ C(n), and for n≡1 mod 5, C(n)=1/φ. So for n=71, we want k[71] ≈ 2^71 / φ.

But from the recurrence, k[71] = 2*k[70] + 2^71 - m[71].

We know k[70] = 970436974005023690481.

And 2^71 is a large number. I need to find m[71].

The key discovery for n=13 might provide a clue. It says k[13] = floor(1/φ × 2^13) + 22 × k[3].

22 × k[3] = 22*7=154, and floor(1/φ × 2^13). 1/φ ≈ 0.618034, 2^13=8192, 0.618034*8192≈5062.24, floor=5062, plus 154=5216, which is k[13].

But what is k[13] from the recurrence? I don't have k[12] or m[13], so I need to see if this formula fits the recurrence.

Perhaps for n≡1 mod 5, the correction term is zero, meaning that k[n] = floor(1/φ × 2^n) exactly? But from n=5, k[5]=21, and 2^5=32, 32/φ≈19.78, floor=19, but k[5]=21, which is not 19. So it's not exact floor; there is a correction.

n=5 is ≡0 mod 5? 5 mod 5=0, not 1. The pattern is for n≡1 mod 5. So for n=1, n=6, n=11, etc. But n=1: k[1]=1, 2^1=2, 2/φ≈1.236, floor=1, so k[1]=1, which is floor(2/φ)? 2/φ≈1.236, floor=1, yes. But 1/φ is for k[n]/2^n, so for n=1, k[1]/2^1=1/2=0.5, but 1/φ≈0.618, so not close. Oh, wait, the constant C(n) is k[n]/2^n, and for n=1, it's 0.5, which is not 1/φ. So for n≡1 mod 5, it should be when n=1,6,11,16,21,... but n=1: 1/2=0.5, 1/φ=0.618, not close. n=6: k[6]=49, 2^6=64, 49/64=0.765625, 1/φ=0.618, not close. So I think I have a confusion.

Let's read the verified findings again: "For n ≡ 1 (mod 5), C(n) = 1/φ" and examples given: n=16,21,36,56,61. So n=16: k[16]/2^16 ≈ π/4? No, it says for n=16, C(n)=π/4? Let's see: "k[16]/2^16 = 0.7860 ≈ π/4" but π/4≈0.7854, so yes. But then it says for n≡1 mod 5, C(n)=1/φ? n=16≡1 mod 5? 16 div 5 is 3 with remainder 1, yes 16≡1 mod 5. But 1/φ≈0.618, but here k[16]/2^16≈0.7860 which is π/4, not 1/φ. There's inconsistency.

Let's read carefully: "1. k[n] / 2^n ≈ mathematical constant C(n)" and then "2. For n ≡ 1 (mod 5), C(n) = 1/φ" but then in point 1, for n=16, it says ≈π/4. So point 2 must be for specific n that are ≡1 mod 5, but n=16 is ≡1 mod 5, but C(n) is π/4 for n=16? That contradicts point 2.

Perhaps I misread. Let's see: "2. For n ≡ 1 (mod 5), C(n) = 1/φ (golden ratio inverse)" and then it says "n=16,21,36,56,61 all match 1/φ pattern" but for n=16, from point 1, it says k[16]/2^16=0.7860≈π/4, which is not 1/φ. 1/φ=0.618, so 0.786 is not 0.618. So there's a mistake in my reading.

Let's read point 1: it says "k[61]/2^61 = 0.6183 ≈ 1/φ" and "k[58]/2^58 = 0.6938 ≈ ln(2)" and "k[16]/2^16 = 0.7860 ≈ π/4". So for different n, C(n) is different constants. Then point 2 says for n≡1 mod 5, C(n)=1/φ, but n=16 is ≡1 mod 5, but from point 1, for n=16, C(n)≈π/4, so point 2 must be for n that are ≡1 mod 5 and also large enough or something? But n=61 is ≡1 mod 5, and for n=61, C(n)≈1/φ, which matches point 2. Similarly, n=56≡1 mod 5? 56 div 5 is 11*5=55, remainder 1, so yes, and for n=56, C(n) should be 1/φ? But from point 2, n=56 is listed as matching 1/φ pattern. But from point 1, only n=61 is mentioned with 1/φ, and n=58 with ln(2), n=16 with π/4. So for n=56, it must be that k[56]/2^56 ≈1/φ.

So point 2 is consistent: for n≡1 mod 5, C(n)=1/φ, and examples include n=56 and n=61, which are both ≡1 mod 5. n=16 is also ≡1 mod 5, but from point 1, for n=16, C(n)≈π/4, so why is n=16 listed in point 2? It says "n=16,21,36,56,61 all match 1/φ pattern" but from point 1, n=16 matches π/4, not 1/φ. This is confusing.

Perhaps I have a typo in point 1. Let's read the user's message: "k[16]/2^16 = 0.7860 ≈ π/4 (0.07% error)" but then in point 2, it says "n=16,21,36,56,61 all match 1/φ pattern". This is inconsistent unless for n=16, it matches both? But 0.7860 and 0.618 are different.

Another possibility: perhaps for n=16, it is listed in point 2 because it matches 1/φ? But 0.7860 is not 0.618. Let's calculate 1/φ: φ≈1.618, 1/φ≈0.618034, so 0.7860 is closer to 0.7854 which is π/4, so it must be that for n=16, C(n) is π/4, and for n=16, it is ≡1 mod 5, but point 2 says for n≡1 mod 5, C(n)=1/φ, so there is an exception for n=16? Or perhaps point 2 is only for n greater than something.

Let's list the n in point 2: n=16,21,36,56,61. Now, n=16: 16/5=3.2, remainder 1, so ≡1 mod 5. n=21:21/5=4.2, rem 1, ≡1 mod 5. n=36:36/5=7.2, rem 1, ≡1 mod 5. n=56:56/5=11.2, rem 1, ≡1 mod 5. n=61:61/5=12.2, rem 1, ≡1 mod 5.

But from point 1, for n=16, C(n)≈π/4, for n=61, C(n)≈1/φ. So for n=16, it should not match 1/φ. Perhaps the user made a mistake in point 2 by including n=16. Or perhaps for n=16, C(n) is indeed 1/φ? Let's calculate k[16]/2^16. 2^16=65536. If k[16]/65536=0.7860, then k[16]=0.7860*65536≈51500 approximately? But from the pattern, k[16] might be known? Not given directly, but from the recurrence, we can compute if we have previous terms.

Perhaps the constant C(n) changes based on n mod something. Another idea from the key discovery: the correction involves π and φ. So for different n, the constant approximates different irrational numbers.

For the task, we have n=71, which is prime and ≡1 mod 5, so from point 2, C(71) should be 1/φ, so k[71]/2^71 ≈ 1/φ, so k[71] ≈ 2^71 / φ.

But from the recurrence, k[71] = 2*k[70] + 2^71 - m[71].

So we need m[71] such that this holds approximately equal to 2^71 / φ.

But from the key discovery, for n=13, there is an exact formula involving floor(1/φ × 2^n) and a correction with 22 and k[3].

So perhaps for n=71, there is a similar formula.

The key discovery says: k[13] = floor(1/φ × 2^13) + 22 × k[3]

22 is from the fraction 22/7 for π, and k[3]=7.

So perhaps for general n, the correction term involves a rational approximation of π or other constants.

Notice that in the recurrence, m[n] might be related to k[n-3] or something.

From the values of m[n] I calculated: m[2]=3, m[3]=7, m[4]=22, m[5]=27, m[6]=57, m[7]=150.

Let's see if these relate to k values. k[3]=7, and m[3]=7. m[4]=22, which is 22*1, but k[1]=1, so 22*k[1]=22? But for n=4, m[4]=22, and k[1]=1, so perhaps m[n] = 22 * k[n-3] for n=4? n-3=1, yes.

For n=5, m[5]=27, and if m[n] = 22 * k[n-3], then for n=5, k[2]=3, 22*3=66, but m[5]=27, not 66. So not that.

Perhaps m[n] = c * k[n-a] for some a and c.

Another idea: from the key discovery, for n=13, the correction term is 22*k[3], which is added to the floor value. But in the recurrence, m[n] is subtracted. So for n=13, if k[13] = floor(1/φ × 2^13) + 22*k[3], then from recurrence, k[13] = 2*k[12] + 2^13 - m[13], so m[13] = 2*k[12] + 2^13 - k[13] = 2*k[12] + 2^13 - floor(1/φ × 2^13) - 22*k[3].

But this doesn't simplify easily.

Perhaps for n≡1 mod 5, the correction term is zero, meaning that m[n] is chosen so that k[n] = floor(1/φ × 2^n). But from n=5, which is not ≡1 mod 5, but n=6≡1 mod 5? n=6 mod 5=1, yes. n=6: k[6]=49, floor(1/φ × 2^6) = floor(0.618*64) = floor(39.55) =39, but k[6]=49, which is not 39. So not floor.

Perhaps for n≡1 mod 5, k[n] is close to 2^n / φ, but not necessarily floor.

But from the key discovery, for n=13, which is not ≡1 mod 5 (13 mod 5=3), they have an exact expression.

So for n=71, since it is ≡1 mod 5, perhaps there is a similar exact expression.

Another thought: the number 22 appears, which is related to π, and also from m[4]=22, and k[3]=7, so 22/7≈π.

Perhaps for n such that n mod something, m[n] = 22 * k[n-3] or something.

Let's list n and m[n] from above:
n=2, m=3
n=3, m=7
n=4, m=22
n=5, m=27
n=6, m=57
n=7, m=150

Now, let's see the difference between m[n] and something.

Notice that m[4]=22, and for n=13, 22*k[3]=154.

Also, from the recurrence, perhaps m[n] can be expressed in terms of previous m or k.

Another idea: perhaps m[n] is related to the Fibonacci sequence or something because φ is involved.

Let's list the k[n] sequence: k[1]=1, k[2]=3, k[3]=7, k[4]=8, k[5]=21, k[6]=49, k[7]=76.

This sequence might be related to the recurrence itself. The recurrence is k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n], so it depends on m[n].

Perhaps m[n] is chosen to make k[n] integer and close to 2^n / φ.

But we need a formula for m[n].

From the key discovery, for n=13, they use k[3] in the correction. k[3] is for n=3. So for n=71, perhaps the correction involves k[71-68] or something? 68 is multiple of 5? Not sure.

Notice that in the formula for n=13, they use k[3], and 13-3=10, which is 2*5, so perhaps for n, they use k[n-10] or something.

n=13, n-10=3, yes. But for n=71, n-10=61, and k[61] is not given, but we have k[70], so not helpful.

Perhaps the shift is based on n mod 5.

Let's list n and n mod 5 for the k values we have:
n=1: mod5=1, k=1
n=2: mod5=2, k=3
n=3: mod5=3, k=7
n=4: mod5=4, k=8
n=5: mod5=0, k=21
n=6: mod5=1, k=49
n=7: mod5=2, k=76

From point 2, for n≡1 mod 5, C(n)=1/φ, so for n=1, k[1]/2^1=0.5, which is not 1/φ, so for small n, it may not hold, but for large n, it holds. n=6: k[6]/2^6=49/64=0.765625, which is not 1/φ≈0.618, so for n=6, it doesn't hold either. But from point 2, n=16,21,36,56,61 are large n, so for large n≡1 mod 5, C(n)=1/φ.

So for n=71, which is large, C(71)=1/φ, so k[71] ≈ 2^71 / φ.

But we need exact k[71] from the recurrence, so we need m[71].

Perhaps from the recurrence, m[n] is small compared to 2^n, so for large n, k[n] ≈ 2*k[n-1] + 2^n, so k[n] grows like 2^n times something.

From the constant, k[n] ~ C(n) * 2^n, so from recurrence, C(n) * 2^n ≈ 2 * C(n-1) * 2^{n-1} + 2^n - m[n], so C(n) * 2^n ≈ 2 C(n-1) 2^{n-1} + 2^n - m[n] = C(n-1) 2^n + 2^n - m[n], so C(n) 2^n ≈ (C(n-1) +1) 2^n - m[n], so m[n] ≈ (C(n-1) +1 - C(n)) 2^n.

For large n, if C(n) is constant, then C(n-1) ≈ C(n), so m[n] ≈ (C+1-C) 2^n = 2^n, which is large, but from the values, m[n] is much smaller than 2^n for small n, so for large n, if C(n) is constant, then m[n] would be about 2^n, but that seems unlikely because then k[n] would be small? Let's see: if m[n] ≈ 2^n, then from recurrence, k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n] ≈ 2*k[n-1], so k[n] would grow like 2^n, but with C(n), if C(n) is constant, then k[n] ~ C 2^n, so from recurrence, 2*k[n-1] ~ 2 C 2^{n-1} = C 2^n, so then k[n] ≈ C 2^n from 2*k[n-1], and the 2^n - m[n] term would be small if m[n] ≈ 2^n, so 2^n - m[n] ≈0, so indeed k[n] ≈ 2*k[n-1], so C(n) ≈ C(n-1), so it consistent if m[n] ≈ 2^n. But from small n, m[2]=3, 2^2=4, so m[2]≈3/4=0.75 of 2^2, m[3]=7, 2^3=8, 7/8=0.875, m[4]=22, 2^4=16, 22/16=1.375, so it varies. For large n, if C(n) is constant, then m[n] should be approximately 2^n. But for n=71, 2^71 is huge, and m[71] would be huge, but from the correction formula, it might be related to k values.

Perhaps for n≡1 mod 5, m[n] is exactly 2^n - something.

Let's think about the key discovery formula: k[13] = floor(1/φ × 2^13) + 22 × k[3]

This can be written as k[13] = round(2^13 / φ) or something? floor(2^13 / φ) would be floor(8192/1.618) = floor(5062.24) =5062, and then plus 154=5216.

But from the recurrence, k[13] = 2*k[12] + 2^13 - m[13], so if we set this equal to floor(2^13 / φ) + 22*k[3], then m[13] = 2*k[12] + 2^13 - floor(2^13 / φ) - 22*k[3].

But this doesn't give a simple formula for m[13].

Perhaps for general n, m[n] = 2^n - floor(2^n / φ) - c * k[n-a] for some a and c.

But from n=13, c=22 and a=10? n-a=3.

For n=71, a=10, n-a=61, but we don't have k[61], so that might not work.

Another idea: perhaps the correction term is based on the value of n mod 5 or other modulus.

Let's list the m[n] values for n=2 to7 with n mod 5:
n=2 mod5=2, m=3
n=3 mod5=3, m=7
n=4 mod5=4, m=22
n=5 mod5=0, m=27
n=6 mod5=1, m=57
n=7 mod5=2, m=150

Now, for n=6 mod5=1, m=57. Is there a relation? k[6]=49, but not obvious.

Perhaps m[n] = m[n-1] + m[n-2] or something? m[3]=7, m[4]=22, 7+22=29, but m[5]=27, not 29. m[4]=22, m[5]=27, 22+27=49, but m[6]=57, not 49. m[5]=27, m[6]=57, 27+57=84, but m[7]=150, not 84. So not Fibonacci-like.

Perhaps m[n] is related to 2^n minus something.

Let's calculate for n=6: m[6]=57, 2^6=64, 64-57=7, which is k[3]? k[3]=7. For n=5: m[5]=27, 2^5=32, 32-27=5, but k[2]=3, not 5. For n=4: m[4]=22, 2^4=16, 16-22= -6, not related. For n=3: m[3]=7, 2^3=8, 8-7=1, k[1]=1. For n=2: m[2]=3, 2^2=4, 4-3=1, k[1]=1. For n=7: m[7]=150, 2^7=128, 128-150= -22, not related.

So for n=3 and n=2, 2^n - m[n] =1 = k[1]. For n=6, 2^6 - m[6] =64-57=7=k[3]. For n=5, 2^5 - m[5] =32-27=5, but k[2]=3, not 5. So not consistent.

Perhaps for n mod5=2,2^n - m[n] = k[1] for n=2, and for n=7 mod5=2, 2^7 - m[7] =128-150= -22, not k[1]. So no.

Another idea: from the key discovery, the number 22 is important. 22 is also m[4]. So for n=4, m[4]=22. For n=13, they use 22*k[3]. So perhaps for n, m[n] = 22 * k[n-3] when n is multiple of something? n=4, n-3=1, k[1]=1, 22*1=22, yes. n=13, if we consider m[13], but from the formula, they don't use m[13] directly, but they use 22*k[3] in the expression for k[13].

Perhaps for n such that n ≡ 4 mod 10 or something? n=4, and n=13? 13 mod10=3, not 4.

Let's list n where the correction might apply. From the key discovery, it applies to n=13. What is special about n=13? 13 mod5=3, and they use k[3].

For n=71, which mod5=1, perhaps they use k[1] or something.

Perhaps the correction term is always 22 * k[n-10] for n>10? For n=13, n-10=3, 22*k[3]=154, which is the correction added to the floor value. But for n=13, k[13] is given by that formula, so for n=71, k[71] = floor(1/φ × 2^71) + 22 * k[71-10] = floor(1/φ × 2^71) + 22 * k[61].

But we don't know k[61], so this might not help.

But we know k[70], and from the recurrence, we can find k[71] if we know m[71], so we need m[71].

Perhaps m[71] is related to k[61] or something.

From the recurrence, if we assume that for large n, k[n] ≈ 2^n / φ, then from recurrence, k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n] ≈ 2*(2^{n-1} / φ) + 2^n - m[n] = 2^n / φ + 2^n - m[n] = 2^n (1/φ +1) - m[n].

But k[n] ≈ 2^n / φ, so 2^n / φ ≈ 2^n (1/φ +1) - m[n], so m[n] ≈ 2^n (1/φ +1) - 2^n / φ = 2^n *1 = 2^n.

So for large n, if C(n) = 1/φ, then m[n] ≈ 2^n.

But from the values, for n=6, which is mod5=1, but small, m[6]=57, 2^6=64, 57/64=0.89, so not exactly 2^6, but for large n, it might be closer.

For n=71, m[71] might be approximately 2^71.

But we need the exact value, so there must be a formula.

Perhaps from the key discovery, the formula for k[n] is exact for some n, and for n=71, it might be similar.

Another thought: the key discovery involves floor(1/φ × 2^n) and then adding 22*k[3]. Notice that 1/φ × 2^n is approximately k[n], so the floor function gives the integer part, and the correction term 22*k[3] adjusts it to the actual k[n].

Similarly, for n=71, perhaps k[71] = floor(1/φ × 2^71) + c * k[71-b] for some constants c and b.

From n=13, c=22, b=10.

But what are c and b? 22 is from the rational approximation of π, and b=10 might be related to something.

Perhaps for n≡1 mod 5, c and b are different.

Let's look at other n from point 2. For n=16, which is ≡1 mod 5, from point 1, k[16]/2^16 ≈ π/4, so for n=16, C(n)=π/4, not 1/φ. So for n=16, it doesn't follow the 1/φ pattern? But point 2 says n=16 matches 1/φ pattern? This is confusing.

Perhaps there is a mistake in the user's message. Let me read carefully: "2. For n ≡ 1 (mod 5), C(n) = 1/φ (golden ratio inverse)" and then "n=16,21,36,56,61 all match 1/φ pattern". But from point 1, for n=16, it matches π/4, so unless for n=16, both approximations are close, but 0.7860 vs 0.6180, the error is large, so it must be that for n=16, C(n) is π/4, and for n=61, C(n) is 1/φ, so why is n=16 listed in point 2? Perhaps it's a typo, and n=16 should not be there, or perhaps n=16 is for a different constant.

Maybe the constant C(n) depends on n mod something else. For example, when n is multiple of 4, C(n)=π/4, when n≡1 mod 5, C(n)=1/φ, etc. But n=16 is multiple of 4 and ≡1 mod 5, so it could be either, but from point 1, it is π/4, so for n=16, C(n)=π/4, and for n=61, C(n)=1/φ.

For n=71, since it is ≡1 mod 5, C(71)=1/φ, so we proceed with that.

So for n=71, k[71] ≈ 2^71 / φ.

But from the recurrence, k[71] = 2*k[70] + 2^71 - m[71].

So if we want k[71] = floor(2^71 / φ) or something, but from the key discovery, for n=13, they use floor(1/φ × 2^13), which is floor(2^13 / φ), since 1/φ = φ^{-1}.

So for n=71, perhaps k[71] = floor(2^71 / φ) + correction.

But what correction? From n=13, the correction is 22*k[3]. For n=71, perhaps the correction is 22*k[61] since 71-10=61.

But we don't have k[61], so we need to find another way.

Perhaps the correction is always 22*k[n-10] for n>10.

But for n=71, n-10=61, and k[61] is not given, but maybe we can find k[61] from the recurrence if we know m[61], but we don't.

Another idea: perhaps from the recurrence, m[n] is determined by the condition that k[n] is integer, and it might be that m[n] = 2^n - floor(2^n / φ) for n≡1 mod 5? Let's test for n=6≡1 mod 5. floor(2^6 / φ) = floor(64/1.618) = floor(39.55) =39. Then 2^6 - floor(2^6 / φ) =64-39=25, but m[6]=57, not 25. So not.

Perhaps m[n] = 2^n - floor(2^n / φ) - something.

Let's calculate for n=6: floor(2^6 / φ)=39, then k[6] from recurrence would be 2*k[5] +2^6 - m[6] =2*21+64-57=42+64-57=49, which is correct. But if we set m[6]=2^6 - floor(2^6 / φ)=25, then k[6]=2*21+64-25=42+64-25=81, which is not 49. So no.

Perhaps for n≡1 mod 5, k[n] = floor(2^n / φ) + k[n-10] or something. For n=6, n-10=-4, not defined.

I need to use the given k[70] to find k[71] via the recurrence with m[71].

But what is m[71]? Perhaps m[n] can be expressed in terms of n and previous k.

From the values of m[n] for small n, I see that m[4]=22, which is 22*1, and m[6]=57, which is 57, and 57/19=3, but not sure.

Another thought: from the key discovery, the number 22 is used, and 22/7≈π, so perhaps for n, m[n] is related to a rational approximation of π.

Perhaps for n=71, m[71] = floor(2^71 / π) or something, but that seems unlikely.

Let's think about the difference between k[n] and 2^n / φ. For large n, the difference should be small if C(n)=1/φ, but from the recurrence, the difference might be related to the correction term.

Perhaps for n≡1 mod 5, the correction term is zero, meaning that m[n] is chosen so that k[n] = round(2^n / φ) or something.

For n=61, which is given, k[61]/2^61 ≈1/φ, so for n=61, k[61] is close to 2^61 / φ.

But from the recurrence, k[61] = 2*k[60] + 2^61 - m[61], so m[61] = 2*k[60] + 2^61 - k[61].

If k[61] ≈ 2^61 / φ, then m[61] ≈ 2*k[60] + 2^61 - 2^61 / φ = 2*k[60]
