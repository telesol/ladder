# TASK: Option 8 - Alternative Decomposition Analysis

## Background
We have verified the recurrence formula for Bitcoin puzzle keys:
```
k_n = 2 × k_{n-1} + adj_n
adj_n = 2^n - m_n × k_{d_n}
```

This formula is 100% verified for all 70 known keys (k1-k70).

## The Problem
We know m_n and d_n for n=2..70, but we cannot determine HOW m_n is generated.
Without knowing the m_n generation rule, we cannot predict k_71 and beyond.

## Your Task
Find an ALTERNATIVE decomposition of adj_n that might reveal a simpler pattern.

## Data
First 30 m values (n=2..31):
[1, 1, 22, 9, 19, 50, 23, 493, 19, 1921, 1241, 8342, 2034, 26989, 8470, 138269, 255121, 564091, 900329, 670674, 1603443, 8804812, 1693268, 29226275, 78941020, 43781837, 264700930, 591430834, 105249691, 2111419265]

First 30 d values (n=2..31):
[2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 7, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1]

First 30 adj values (n=2..31):
[1, 1, -6, 9, 17, 14, 104, 5, 883, -1, 523, 102, 4312, 125, 15142, -1061, 5247, 2581, -3305, 76566, 46725, 75620, 553096, -64707, 5106132, 4903887, -14315298, -54096558, 119315449, -55386497]

Base keys:
k1=1, k2=3, k3=7, k4=8, k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224

## Alternative Forms to Try

1. **Additive form**: adj_n = a×2^n + b×k_{d1} + c×k_{d2} + offset
   - Can adj_n be expressed as a LINEAR combination of powers and earlier keys?

2. **Multiplicative form**: adj_n = (a×n + b) × k_d + c×2^n
   - Is there a pattern where the multiplier depends on n?

3. **Ratio form**: adj_n / 2^n = f(n) for some function f
   - What is the pattern in adj_n / 2^n?

4. **Continued fraction**: Express m_n as a continued fraction
   - Does m_n have a continued fraction expansion that's periodic or predictable?

5. **Different reference key**: Instead of k_d minimizing |m|, try:
   - Always use k_1
   - Always use k_{n-1}
   - Use k_{floor(n/2)}

6. **XOR relationship**: Does m_n XOR n reveal a pattern?

7. **Binary digit extraction**: Is m_n derived from binary digits of some master sequence?

## Output Format
For each alternative form you try, report:
1. The formula you tested
2. Whether it fits the data exactly or approximately
3. If approximate, what is the maximum error?
4. Any patterns you observe

MOST IMPORTANTLY: If you find a form that predicts m_n from n alone (without knowing k_n), report it immediately.
