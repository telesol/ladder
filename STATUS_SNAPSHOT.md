# Status Snapshot - Synthesis Initiated

**Date**: 2025-12-19 20:48 UTC
**Machine**: ZBook (kh-assist local)
**Status**: Distributed findings merged, PySR synthesis strategy ready

## Current State

✅ **COMPLETED**:
- GitHub remote configured (https://github.com/telesol/ladder)
- Distributed work findings fetched and reviewed
- Key discoveries extracted:
  - Master formula: k_n = 2 × k_{n-1} + adj_n
  - Convergent combination patterns discovered
  - convergent_database.py available
  - Verified formulas k5-k20
- Synthesis strategy documented
- Coordination note for other Claude instances created

⏳ **NEXT**:
- Set up experiments/06-pysr-m-sequence/
- Execute PySR training (4-6 hours)
- Validate and generate full sequence

## Key Insight

**Don't use LLM as calculator - use PySR for math, LLM for reasoning!**

## Files Created

- `PYSR_SYNTHESIS_STRATEGY.md` - Complete execution plan
- `COORDINATION_NOTE_FOR_OTHER_CLAUDE.md` - Inter-Claude coordination
- `STATUS_SNAPSHOT.md` - This file

## For Other Claude

Read `COORDINATION_NOTE_FOR_OTHER_CLAUDE.md` for full context and next steps.

We're combining your LLM reasoning (WHAT) with PySR computation (HOW) to find the complete solution.

**Stay tuned - breakthrough incoming!** 🚀
