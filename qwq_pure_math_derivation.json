  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these tasks one by one. Since I need to derive the exact formulas systematically without predictions, I'll go step by step through each task. Let me start with Task 1: finding the formula for k9 = 467.\n\n**Task 1: Find the exact formula for k9 = 467**\n\nFirst, the problem states that I should check formulas like k_a \u00d7 M + k_b, k_a \u00d7 k_b \u00b1 C, and k_a\u00b2 \u00b1 C. The indices a and b are from 1 to 8, and constants M and C are within specified ranges. Since the user wants a systematic approach, I need to check all possible combinations in these ranges. However, doing this manually for all possibilities would take a long time, so maybe there's a smarter way to narrow down the options.\n\nLet me list the known keys up to k8 first:\n\nk1=1, k2=3, k3=7, k4=8, k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224.\n\nWe need to find a combination of these that can produce 467. Let's consider possible operations:\n\n1. **k_a \u00d7 M + k_b**:\n   For this, I need to find a, b, and M such that when multiplied and added, the result is 467.\n\n   Let's try different a and b pairs. Let's start with larger k values since 467 is a relatively large number.\n\n   For example, trying k8 (224) with some M and adding another key:\n\n   Let\u2019s suppose a=8 (k8=224). Let\u2019s see what M would be:\n\n   Let\u2019s try 224*M + k_b = 467.\n\n   Let\u2019s see if there's an M and b such that 224*M is less than 467. Let's try M=2: 224*2 = 448. Then 467-448=19. But none of the keys up to k8 are 19. The closest is k5=21, which is too big. Hmm. Maybe M=1? 224 + k_b =467 \u2192 k_b=243, which is way too big. So maybe not k8.\n\n   Next, try k7=76. Let's see 76*M + k_b =467.\n\n   Trying M=6: 76*6=456. Then 467-456=11, but there is no key for 11. M=5: 380, so 467-380=87, not in keys. M=4: 304, so 163, nope. M=3: 228, 239 nope. M=2: 152, 315? Not there. M=1: 76, so 391, nope.\n\n   Maybe a different a. Let's try k6=49:\n\n   49*M + k_b=467.\n\n   Let's see M=9: 49*9=441. 467-441=26. Not a key. M=8: 392, 467-392=75. Not a key. M=7: 343, 124? Not there. M=6: 294, 173? No. Hmm.\n\n   How about k5=21?\n\n   21*M +k_b=467.\n\n   Let's try M=22: 21*22=462, so 467-462=5. Not a key. M=21: 441, 26? Not. M=20: 420, 47? Not. Hmm. Not obvious.\n\n   Maybe k4=8:\n\n   8*M +k_b=467.\n\n   Let's see M=50 gives 400, so 67. Not a key. M=57: 456 + k_b=11? Not there. Hmm.\n\n   Maybe try smaller a, but perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me try the next form.\n\n2. **k_a \u00d7 k_b \u00b1 C**:\n\n   Here, we can try multiplying two keys and then adding or subtracting a small constant (between -100 and 100) to reach 467.\n\n   Let's consider possible pairs of keys whose product is near 467.\n\n   Let's see:\n\n   k8 (224) \u00d7 k2 (3) = 672. Then 672 - C = 467 \u2192 C=205. But C must be between -100 and 100, so that's out.\n\n   k7 (76) \u00d7 k6 (49) = 76*49 = 3724. That's way too big.\n\n   k7\u00d7k4 (76\u00d78)=608. 608 - 141=467, but 141 is beyond the allowed C.\n\n   k6\u00d7k5 (49\u00d721)=1029. Way too big.\n\n   Maybe smaller keys:\n\n   k5\u00d7k4 (21\u00d78)=168. 168 + 299=467, but too big.\n\n   k7\u00d7k5 (76\u00d721)=1596. Too big.\n\n   Maybe lower:\n\n   k4\u00d7k3 (8\u00d77)=56. 56 + 411=467, but too big.\n\n   Hmm, maybe subtract:\n\n   Let's see 467 + C = product. Let's see 224\u00d72 =448. Not enough. 224 \u00d7 2.1 is about 470.4. But fractions aren't allowed.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps k3 (7) \u00d7 k8 (224)= 7\u00d7224=1568. 1568 - 1101=467, but again C too big.\n\n   Maybe two smaller keys:\n\n   Let's see k5 (21) \u00d7k4 (8)=168. 168 + 299=467, but again too big.\n\n   k7 (76) \u00d7 k2 (3) = 228. 228 + 239=467. 239 is within the allowed C? Wait, C can be up to 100. No, because 239 is over 100. So that's invalid.\n\n   Maybe k7 \u00d7 k3=76\u00d77=532. 532 - 65=467. Here, 65 is within -100 to 100. Let's check: 532 - 65 = 467. Yes, that works. So k7 \u00d7 k3 = 532. 532 - 65 = 467. So formula would be k7 \u00d7 k3 - 65 =467. Let me check if that's correct.\n\n   Wait, 76\u00d77 is 532, yes. 532 minus 65 is indeed 467. That seems to fit. Let me confirm:\n\n   76\u00d77 = 532, 532-65=467. Yes. So that is a valid formula. But wait, is there a smaller C? Let me check if there's another combination with smaller C.\n\n   Let me see another possibility:\n\n   k8 \u00d7 something? 224 \u00d7 2 =448. 448 +19=467. So k8 \u00d72 +19? But in the formula, it would be k8 \u00d72 +19. The problem allows k_a \u00d7 M + k_b, but here 19 isn't a key. Wait, but maybe using another key. Let me see:\n\n   If we consider k8 \u00d72 + k_b =467, then 448 + k_b=467 \u21d2k_b=19. But there is no key 19. So that's not possible.\n\n   Alternatively, if we use the form k_a \u00d7 k_b \u00b1 C, then 224\u00d72 is 448, and 448 +19=467, but 19 isn't a key, so that formula might not be valid unless 19 is a key. It isn't. So maybe the first option with k7 \u00d7k3 -65 is valid.\n\n   Alternatively, let's see if any other pair:\n\n   k6 (49) \u00d7 k4 (8)= 392. 392 +75=467. But 75 not a key. 392 +75=467, but 75 not in keys.\n\n   k5 \u00d7k6 (21\u00d749)=1029 too big.\n\n   Hmm. Alternatively, k3 squared? 7\u00b2=49, which is k6. Not helpful here.\n\n   Let me see another approach. Let's check the third possible form:\n\n3. **k_a\u00b2 \u00b1 C**\n\n   Let's compute squares of keys up to k8:\n\n   k1\u00b2=1, k2\u00b2=9, k3\u00b2=49 (which is k6), k4\u00b2=64, k5\u00b2=441, k6\u00b2=2401, k7\u00b2=5776 (which was used for k13), k8\u00b2=50176.\n\n   So, looking for a\u00b2 \u00b1 C =467.\n\n   Let's try k5\u00b2 =441. 441 +26=467. So that's k5\u00b2 +26. 26 is within the range. Alternatively, 441 +26=467. So that could be a formula. Let me check:\n\n   k5 squared is 21\u00b2=441. 441 +26=467. But 26 is a constant. The problem allows formulas with constants between -100 and 100. So this is possible. So another possible formula is k5\u00b2 +26.\n\n   So now I have two possibilities:\n\n   - k7 \u00d7 k3 -65 = 467\n   - k5\u00b2 +26 =467\n\n   Which one is the correct one? The problem states that the formula must be exact, so both are correct? But maybe there is another condition. Wait, the problem says \"Find the EXACT formula for k9 = 467\". Since there might be multiple formulas, but perhaps we need the one that fits the existing pattern.\n\n   Wait, let's check the existing formulas given. For example, k5 is k2\u00d7k3, k6 is k3 squared, which is similar to the second formula here. The first formula is a product minus a constant. Let's see if there's another way. Wait, maybe there's another formula.\n\n   Let me check another combination:\n\n   Let's see, k8 divided by something? 224 divided by 2 is 112. 112 + 355=467, but that's not helpful.\n\n   Alternatively, k7 + k8: 76+224=300, too small.\n\n   k6 +k8=49+224=273, still too small.\n\n   Hmm. Alternatively, k4* something:\n\n   k4=8. 8 \u00d758 +3? Not sure.\n\n   Wait, let's see if there's a combination with addition of keys:\n\n   Let me check all possible sums of two keys multiplied by something.\n\n   Alternatively, maybe k7 + k8 \u00d7 something? Not sure.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps k9 is related to previous keys in another way. Let me see if there's another formula.\n\n   Wait, trying the first form again, k_a \u00d7 M +k_b.\n\n   Let me try k5 \u00d72 + something:\n\n   21\u00d721=441? Wait, 21\u00d721 is 441, which is k5 squared.\n\n   Wait, maybe k5 \u00d7 something plus another key:\n\n   21\u00d722 =462. 462 +5=467. But 5 is k1\u00d75? Hmm, but 5 isn't a key. Wait, the formula would be 21\u00d722 +5. But 22 is not a key. Alternatively, 21\u00d722 +k1\u00d75? Not sure. Since the problem allows constants, perhaps k5\u00d722 +5, but 22 isn't a key. So maybe this isn't valid.\n\n   Alternatively, k5 \u00d721 + 26 =441 +26=467. But that's the same as the squared plus 26.\n\n   Hmm. Alternatively, trying k8 divided by something?\n\n   224 divided by 0.5 is 448, but that's not an integer. Hmm.\n\n   Wait, maybe another product combination:\n\n   k7 \u00d7k4 (76\u00d78)=608. 608-141=467. But 141 is too big for C.\n\n   Hmm.\n\n   Let me re-examine the two possibilities I found:\n\n   **Option 1: k7 \u00d7k3 -65 =467**\n\n   That is 76\u00d77 -65 = 532 -65 =467. This uses two keys (k7 and k3) with a constant subtracted.\n\n   **Option 2: k5\u00b2 +26 =467**\n\n   That is 21\u00b2 +26 =441 +26=467. This uses k5 squared plus 26.\n\n   Which of these is more plausible given the existing formulas?\n\n   Looking at the existing formulas:\n\n   - k5 = k2\u00d7k3: a product of two keys.\n\n   - k6 =k3\u00b2: a square of a key.\n\n   - k7 =k2\u00d79 +k6: a product of a key and a number plus another key.\n\n   - k8 =k5\u00d713 -k6: product of a key and a number minus another key.\n\n   So some formulas use multipliers (like 9,13, etc.) and constants (but in k12, there's a -5, which is a constant). \n\n   The existing formulas use combinations of keys multiplied by numbers and adding or subtracting keys or constants. \n\n   The formula k5 squared +26 is similar to k6 (which is a square), but with a constant added. Since squares are allowed (k6 is a square), adding a constant might be acceptable. \n\n   The other formula, k7\u00d7k3 -65, is a product of two keys with a constant subtracted. \n\n   Both are valid under the problem's constraints. But perhaps the problem expects the simplest form or the one that uses previous multipliers? Let's see if there is another way.\n\n   Alternatively, let's check if there is a formula without a constant. For example, using three keys:\n\n   k7 +k8 -k_something?\n\n   76 + 224=300. 300 +? Hmm, not helpful.\n\n   Alternatively, 49 (k6) + 224 (k8) + something? 49+224=273, 467-273=194, which is not a key.\n\n   Alternatively, 21 (k5) \u00d7 something: 21\u00d722=462, which is close but not quite.\n\n   Alternatively, 8\u00d758 +3=467, but that's not with keys.\n\n   Hmm, maybe the problem allows multiple formulas, but since the question says \"Find the EXACT formula\", perhaps both are acceptable, but we need to see which one is in the style of previous formulas. \n\n   Looking at the existing formulas, the ones with constants (like k12 has -5) and multipliers (like 9,13). The formula k5 squared +26 uses a square (like k6) plus a constant, while k7\u00d7k3 -65 uses a product minus a constant. Since both are valid, perhaps there's another way?\n\n   Wait, let me see another approach:\n\n   Let me check all possible combinations of two keys multiplied together and see if adding or subtracting a small constant gives 467.\n\n   Let's list all products of two keys (up to k8):\n\n   k1\u00d7k1=1\n\n   k1\u00d7k2=2; k1\u00d7k3=7; k1\u00d7k4=8; k1\u00d7k5=21; k1\u00d7k6=49; k1\u00d7k7=76; k1\u00d7k8=224\n\n   k2\u00d7k2=4; k2\u00d7k3=6; k2\u00d7k4=16; k2\u00d7k5=42; k2\u00d7k6=98; k2\u00d7k7=152; k2\u00d7k8=448\n\n   k3\u00d7k3=49 (k6); k3\u00d7k4=24; k3\u00d7k5=147; k3\u00d7k6=343; k3\u00d7k7=532; k3\u00d7k8=1568\n\n   k4\u00d7k4=64; k4\u00d7k5=168; k4\u00d7k6=392; k4\u00d7k7=304; k4\u00d7k8=1792\n\n   k5\u00d7k5=441; k5\u00d7k6=1029; k5\u00d7k7=1596; k5\u00d7k8=4648\n\n   k6\u00d7k6=2401; etc.\n\n   Looking for a product that is either 467 plus or minus a small number (within \u00b1100):\n\n   467 is close to 441 (k5\u00b2). 467-441=26, so that gives the second formula.\n\n   Also, 532 (k3\u00d7k7) is 467+65, so 532-65=467, which is the first formula.\n\n   Are there any others?\n\n   Let's see:\n\n   k4\u00d7k6=392. 392+75=467, but 75 is outside the range (if we need to have the constant within 100, but 75 is allowed as a positive constant. Wait, the problem says the constant can be between -100 and 100. So 75 is okay. So that would be k4\u00d7k6 +75=392+75=467. So that's another formula: k4\u00d7k6 +75.\n\n   So now we have three possibilities:\n\n   1. k5\u00b2 +26 =467\n\n   2. k3\u00d7k7 -65 =467\n\n   3. k4\u00d7k6 +75=467\n\n   Which one is the correct one?\n\n   The problem states \"Find the EXACT formula for k9 =467\". Since there are multiple possibilities, perhaps the one that uses the fewest keys or follows the pattern of previous formulas.\n\n   Looking at previous formulas:\n\n   - k5 =k2\u00d7k3 (product of two keys)\n\n   - k6=k3\u00b2 (square of a key)\n\n   - k7 =k2\u00d79 +k6 (a key multiplied by a number plus another key)\n\n   - k8=k5\u00d713 -k6 (a key multiplied by a number minus another key)\n\n   - k12= ... not sure but the problem mentions k12 has a -5.\n\n   So formulas often involve multiplying a key by a number and adding/subtracting another key or a small constant.\n\n   The formula k4\u00d7k6 +75 uses two keys multiplied together plus a constant. But in previous formulas, constants like 9,13 are used which are multipliers, but also the formula k12 has a -5. So constants are allowed.\n\n   The formula k5 squared +26 is a square plus a constant, which is similar to the existing formula for k6 (square of a key).\n\n   The formula k3\u00d7k7 -65 is two keys multiplied and subtract a constant.\n\n   All three are valid. However, since the problem says \"the EXACT formula\" perhaps there is a unique one. Maybe I missed something.\n\n   Let me check if any of these constants are keys themselves? 26 isn't a key, 65 isn't, 75 isn't.\n\n   Alternatively, maybe the formula is k7\u00d7k3 minus k6 (49) gives 532-49=483, not 467. Hmm.\n\n   Wait another thought: the problem mentions in the existing formulas that k8 is k5\u00d713 -k6. So the 13 and 5 (in k12) are numbers used as multipliers. Perhaps the formula for k9 uses a similar pattern, like a key multiplied by a number plus/minus another key.\n\n   Let me see if any such combination gives 467.\n\n   Let's try:\n\n   Let me think of 467 divided by some key to see if it gives a whole number:\n\n   467 divided by k5 (21) is about 22.23, not integer.\n\n   Divided by k4 (8) is 58.375.\n\n   Divided by k3 (7) is 66.71...\n\n   Divided by k2 (3) is 155.666...\n\n   Not helpful.\n\n   Alternatively, trying to express 467 as a combination with multipliers like 9,13, etc.\n\n   Let's see:\n\n   If we use 13 again: 13\u00d736 =468 which is 1 over. 13\u00d735=455, which is 12 less than 467.\n\n   9\u00d751=459, which is 8 less.\n\n   Hmm.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps 467= k8 \u00d72 + 19, but 19 isn't a key.\n\n   Alternatively, k7\u00d76 + 5: 76\u00d76=456 +11=467? No, 456+11=467. 11 is a constant.\n\n   Alternatively, k7\u00d76 +11. So two keys multiplied by a number plus a constant. But this may not be better.\n\n   Alternatively, maybe the formula uses three keys. For example, k7 + k8 + something?\n\n   76+224=300. 467-300=167, which is too big.\n\n   Hmm.\n\n   Since I found three possible formulas, but the problem says \"the exact formula\", perhaps the intended one is one of them. Looking back at the problem statement, it says \"the EXACT formula\", implying there is one. Maybe I made a mistake in considering constants.\n\n   Wait, the problem allows \"k_a \u00d7 M + k_b\" where M is a number (could be a multiplier). So for example, in the formula for k7 it's k2\u00d79 +k6, so that's a key multiplied by a number plus another key.\n\n   So if we use a similar structure for k9:\n\n   Let me see, suppose it's k5\u00d7something plus another key.\n\n   21\u00d722=462. 462 +5=467. So that would be k5\u00d722 +5. But 5 isn't a key here, but maybe a constant. But in this case, if we use a multiplier (22) and a constant (5), but the problem allows constants, so this is possible.\n\n   Alternatively, 21\u00d720 + 47= 420+47=467, but 47 isn't a key.\n\n   Alternatively, 21\u00d721 + 46=441+46=487, no.\n\n   Hmm, not helpful.\n\n   Alternatively, if using two keys multiplied with a multiplier:\n\n   Let me see, 8\u00d758 +3=467, but 58 and 3 aren't keys.\n\n   Alternatively, 7\u00d766 + 5=467, but again, not keys.\n\n   Hmm.\n\n   Maybe the intended formula is k5 squared plus 26, since it's a square plus a small constant, similar to k6 being a square. Since k6 is the square of k3, and k5 squared is 441, adding 26 gets to 467. That might be the one.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might expect the formula using keys k3 and k7 with the constant 65, which is 7\u00d776=532-65=467.\n\n   Since both are valid, but perhaps the question is designed so that the answer is one of them. Since the user hasn't provided more context, maybe I should pick the one that uses the least keys and a small constant. Alternatively, the problem might have a unique solution I'm missing.\n\n   Wait, perhaps there's a different approach. Let me consider the possibility that the formula uses previous terms. For example, maybe it's built from k6, k7, k8. Let me see:\n\n   k8 is 224 (from k5\u00d713 -k6: 21\u00d713=273 -49=224, which is correct).\n\n   So 224 (k8) plus 243=467. Not helpful.\n\n   Alternatively, 224\u00d72 + 19=467. Again, 19 isn't a key.\n\n   Hmm.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might be expecting an arithmetic sequence or something else, but I don't see it.\n\n   Since all three formulas are valid, but the problem states \"the exact formula\", perhaps the intended one is k5 squared plus 26. Since squares are a common operation and adding a constant is straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a formula without a constant, but I don't see one.\n\n   Alternatively, let me check if 467 can be expressed as a combination of two keys with multipliers:\n\n   Let me try k7\u00d76 + k5\u00d7 (something):\n\n   76\u00d76=456, plus 21\u00d70.533... No.\n\n   Not helpful.\n\n   Alternatively, k7\u00d75 + k8\u00d7 (something):\n\n   76\u00d75=380, plus 224\u00d70.39... Not helpful.\n\n   Hmm.\n\n   Given that I can't find a formula without a constant, and the problem allows constants, I think the most straightforward ones are:\n\n   1. k5\u00b2 +26\n\n   2. k3\u00d7k7 -65\n\n   The first one uses a square (like k6) plus a constant, the second uses a product of two keys minus a constant.\n\n   Since the problem mentions \"the exact formula\", and since the previous formulas use multipliers and keys, maybe the second one is better, as it uses two keys and a constant, similar to k7 and k8 formulas.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might have a typo or expects a different approach. Since I need to provide an answer, I'll go with the one that uses the product of two keys and subtracts a constant, as it mirrors the structure of k7 and k8.\n\n   So the formula would be k3\u00d7k7 -65=467.\n\n   Let me verify: k3 is 7, k7 is 76. 7\u00d776=532. 532-65=467. Yes, that works.\n\n   Alternatively, if I consider the problem might have a different approach, maybe k9 is part of a sequence where each term is defined by some pattern. For example, the previous terms are:\n\n   k1=1, k2=3, k3=7, k4=8, k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224.\n\n   Looking at these numbers: 1,3,7,8,21,49,76,224,...\n\n   The differences between terms:\n\n   3-1=2, 7-3=4, 8-7=1, 21-8=13, 49-21=28, 76-49=27, 224-76=148.\n\n   Not obvious.\n\n   Alternatively, multiplying previous terms:\n\n   1 to 3: \u00d73\n\n   3 to7: +4\n\n   7 to8: +1\n\n   8 to21: \u00d72.625\n\n   21 to49: \u00d72.333...\n\n   49 to76: +27\n\n   76 to224: \u00d72.947...\n\n   Not helpful.\n\n   Alternatively, thinking of powers:\n\n   1=1^3, 3= not a cube, 7 is prime, 8=2^3, 21=3\u00d77, 49=7^2, 76=4\u00d719, 224= 2^5\u00d77.\n\n   Maybe 224 is 32\u00d77, and the next term could be something with 7 again? 224\u00d72=448, plus 19=467. But that's just guessing.\n\n   Alternatively, 49 (k6) \u00d7 9.53... Not helpful.\n\n   Hmm.\n\n   Given that I can't find a pattern here, and the problem specifically asks for the formula to get 467, I think the correct answer is either k3\u00d7k7 -65 or k5 squared +26. Since in the given examples, k6 is a square, so following that pattern, maybe the answer is k5 squared +26, which is 441 +26=467.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might have k9 defined as k8\u00d72 +19, but 19 is a prime not seen before.\n\n   Alternatively, maybe it's k7\u00d76 + k5\u00d7 (something). 76\u00d76=456 +11=467. But constants are allowed.\n\n   Since the problem is presented in Chinese and the user might have a different approach, but given the information, I'll choose the formula with the square plus 26, because it's a straightforward extension of the existing square in k6.\n\n   So my final answer is \\boxed{k_5^2 + 26} which is 21\u00b2 +26=441+26=467.\n\n   Wait, but the problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". The question is to find the formula for the term that equals 467, which is k9. The problem didn't state to compute the value but to find the formula. Since the question is in Chinese and the user might have a different notation, but assuming that the terms are numbered as k1 to k8 as given, then k9 would be the next term. But the problem says \"You\" followed by the question, so maybe the exact question is to find the formula for the term equal to 467, which is k9, so the answer is one of the formulas above.\n\n   Alternatively, maybe the problem is a sequence where each term is defined by some relation, and 467 is the next term. The previous terms are:\n\n   1, 3, 7, 8, 21, 49, 76, 224, ?\n\n   Looking at these numbers, perhaps it's a combination of different operations. Let me see:\n\n   From 1 to 3: +2\n\n   3 to7: +4\n\n   7 to8: +1\n\n   8 to21: +13\n\n   21 to49: +28\n\n   49 to76: +27\n\n   76 to224: +148\n\n   The increments are: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148\n\n   Not obvious. Alternatively, multiplying factors:\n\n   3 = 1\u00d73\n\n   7 = 3\u00d72 +1\n\n   8 =7 +1\n\n   21=8\u00d72 +5\n\n   49=21\u00d72 +7\n\n   76=49 +27\n\n   224=76\u00d73 + 0?\n\n   Not sure.\n\n   Alternatively, the sequence might be related to previous terms:\n\n   For example, 7 is 1 + 3 + 3,\n\n   8 is 7 +1,\n\n   21 is 8\u00d72 +5,\n\n   Not sure.\n\n   Alternatively, the terms might be following a pattern of multiplying by 2 and adding something:\n\n   1\u00d72 +1=3,\n\n   3\u00d72 +1=7,\n\n   7\u00d71 +1=8,\n\n   8\u00d72 +5=21,\n\n   21\u00d72 +7=49,\n\n   49\u00d71 +27=76,\n\n   76\u00d73 +0=228 (but it's 224, so no).\n\n   Not helpful.\n\n   Alternatively, 224 is 32\u00d77, and 49 is7\u00b2, 76 is 4\u00d719, 21 is 3\u00d77, 8 is2\u00b3, 7 is prime, 3 is prime, 1 is 1.\n\n   Maybe the next term is 467, which is a prime number. 467 is a prime (yes, since it's not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23, etc. sqrt(467)\u224821.6, so primes up to 23: 23\u00d720.3 is 466, so yes, 467 is prime). But not sure how that helps.\n\n   Given that I can't find a pattern in the sequence, and the problem is likely expecting an algebraic expression using previous terms, and given that 467 can be expressed as 7\u00d776 -65, which uses k3 and k7, I think that is the most plausible answer.\n\n   Therefore, I will go with 7\u00d776 -65 = 467, so the formula is k3\u00d7k7 -65.\n\n   Thus, the answer is \\boxed{k_3 \\times k_7 - 65}.\n\n   However, since the problem might expect a numerical expression, but given the way the question is phrased, it's likely expecting an expression in terms of previous terms. Since the user mentioned \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", likely the numerical value, but since 467 is the value, but the question is to find the formula that gives 467. Maybe the question is in Chinese and the user is translating, but based on the given information, the answer is either of the two formulas. Since I can't be sure, but considering the previous terms, the formula using two keys and a constant is more likely, so I'll stick with that.\n",
