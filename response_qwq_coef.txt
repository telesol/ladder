The user mentioned that some of these coefficients are related to m-sequence values from convergents of ln(2) and e. Let me start by recalling what I know about convergents and continued fractions.\n\nFirst, convergents of a number are the fractions obtained from the continued fraction expansion of that number. For example, the convergents of ln(2) would give the best rational approximations to ln(2). Similarly for e. The user mentioned that 9 is m5 from the ln(2) convergent, and 19 is m6 from the e convergent. So maybe each m-number corresponds to a term in the continued fraction expansion of either ln(2) or e?\n\nLet me check the continued fraction expansions for ln(2) and e. \n\nStarting with ln(2). The continued fraction for ln(2) is [0; 1, 2, 3, 1, 6, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, ...]. The convergents are obtained by truncating this continued fraction and converting back to a fraction. The 5th convergent (m5) would be the 5th term here. Wait, but how exactly are they indexed? Typically, convergents are indexed starting from 0. Let me confirm.\n\nThe continued fraction for ln(2) starts as 0 + 1/(1 + 1/(2 + 1/(3 + ... ))). The first convergent is 0/1, then 1/1, then 2/3, then 5/7, then 6/8, etc. Wait, maybe I need to look up the exact convergents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m5 refers to the 5th term in the continued fraction expansion. Let me see:\n\nThe continued fraction coefficients (the a_n terms) for ln(2) are [0;1,2,3,1,6,3,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,4,1,...]. So the first term a0=0, a1=1, a2=2, a3=3, a4=1, a5=6, etc. So m5 would be a5=6? But the user says m5 is 9. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe m refers to the numerator or denominator of the convergent?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m_n is the nth convergent's numerator or denominator? Let's see. Let's compute the first few convergents of ln(2).\n\nThe continued fraction [0;1,2,3,1,6,...] gives:\n\nConvergent 0: 0/1\n\nConvergent 1: 1/1 (since 0 + 1/1)\n\nConvergent 2: 0 + 1/(1 + 1/2) = (1*2 + 0)/ (1*2 +1) = 2/3\n\nWait, actually, the formula for convergents is:\n\nh_n = a_n h_{n-1} + h_{n-2}\n\nSimilarly for denominators k_n.\n\nStarting with h_{-1}=1, h_0=0, etc.\n\nWait, let me recall the standard way to compute convergents.\n\nLet me use the recursive formula:\n\nFor continued fraction [a0; a1, a2, ...], the convergents h_n/k_n are given by:\n\nh_n = a_n h_{n-1} + h_{n-2}\n\nk_n = a_n k_{n-1} + k_{n-2}\n\nWith h_{-1}=1, h_0=a0\n\nk_{-1}=0, k_0=1\n\nSo for ln(2):\n\na0=0, a1=1, a2=2, a3=3, a4=1, a5=6, etc.\n\nCompute convergents step by step:\n\nn=0:\n\nh0 = a0 = 0\n\nk0 = 1\n\nn=1:\n\nh1 = a1*h0 + h_{-1} = 1*0 + 1 = 1\n\nk1 = a1*k0 + k_{-1} = 1*1 + 0 = 1\n\nConvergent 1: 1/1\n\nn=2:\n\nh2 = a2*h1 + h0 = 2*1 +0 =2\n\nk2 = a2*k1 + k0 =2*1 +1 =3\n\nConvergent 2:2/3\n\nn=3:\n\nh3 = a3*h2 + h1 =3*2 +1 =7\n\nk3 =a3*k2 +k1=3*3 +1=10\n\nConvergent3:7/10\n\nn=4:\n\nh4 =a4*h3 + h2 =1*7 +2=9\n\nk4 =a4*k3 +k2 =1*10 +3=13\n\nConvergent4:9/13\n\nn=5:\n\nh5 =a5*h4 + h3 =6*9 +7= 61\n\nk5= a5*k4 +k3=6*13 +10=88\n\nConvergent5:61/88\n\nWait, so m5 would be either 9 (the numerator of convergent4) or 61 (numerator of convergent5)? The user says m5=9, which would correspond to the numerator of the 4th convergent (since n=4). Since they called it m5, maybe it's indexed starting at 1? Let me see:\n\nIf convergent 1:1/1 (n=1),\n\nconvergent 2:2/3 (n=2),\n\nconvergent3:7/10,\n\nconvergent4:9/13,\n\nconvergent5:61/88,\n\nthen m5 (the 5th term) would be the numerator of the 5th convergent, which is 61. But the user says m5=9. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe they count the terms in the continued fraction coefficients? The first term a0=0, a1=1, a2=2, a3=3, a4=1, a5=6. So m5 would be a5=6? But the user says m5=9. Hmm, maybe m5 is the 5th term in the sequence of numerators or denominators?\n\nAlternatively, looking at denominators:\n\nk0=1, k1=1, k2=3, k3=10, k4=13, k5=88,...\n\nSo the denominators: m5 might be 13 (the 4th denominator)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the sequence of convergent denominators? For instance, denominators k_n for the convergents of ln(2). Let me see:\n\nk0=1, k1=1, k2=3, k3=10, k4=13, k5=88, etc.\n\nIf m5 refers to the 5th denominator (k5=88) or the 5th term in some other sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe m5 is the 5th term in the sequence of convergents' numerators: 0,1,2,7,9,61,... So the 5th term here is 9 (since starting at 0: term 0 is 0, term1=1, term2=2, term3=7, term4=9, term5=61...). Wait, term4 would be the 4th term (if starting count at 0), so term5 would be 61. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the m_n as the numerators of the convergents of ln(2) and e, but starting the count differently. The user says 9 is m5 from ln2 convergent, so maybe m5 is the 5th numerator? Let's see:\n\nNumerators:\n\nn=0:0\n\nn=1:1\n\nn=2:2\n\nn=3:7\n\nn=4:9\n\nn=5:61\n\nSo if m5 is the 5th term (n=5?), but 61 is the fifth term (index5), but the user says m5 is 9. So maybe m5 is the 4th term? Then m5 would be the 4th term (index4). Then m5 is 9. That could be. So perhaps m_n corresponds to the numerator of the (n)th convergent, where n starts at 1. Wait:\n\nIf m1=1 (n=1), m2=2 (n=2), m3=7 (n=3), m4=9 (n=4), m5=61 (n=5). Hmm, but the user says m5 is 9. Then that would be m4=9. Maybe there's an off-by-one error here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m refers to the denominator. For denominators:\n\nk0=1, k1=1, k2=3, k3=10, k4=13, k5=88,...\n\nSo m5=13? Not 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe m is the difference between numerators? The difference between numerators h4 - h3 = 9-7=2, but that's not 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo? Or perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the convergents of e. The user says 19 is m6 from e's convergent.\n\nContinued fraction for e is [2; 1,2,1,1,4,1,1,6,1,1,8,...], so the continued fraction coefficients a0=2, a1=1, a2=2, a3=1, a4=1, a5=4, etc.\n\nCompute convergents for e:\n\nStarting with a0=2.\n\nh_{-1}=1, h0=2\n\nk_{-1}=0, k0=1\n\nn=1:\n\nh1 = a1*h0 + h_{-1}=1*2 +1=3\n\nk1 =a1*k0 +k_{-1}=1*1 +0=1\n\nConvergent1:3/1\n\nn=2:\n\nh2 =a2*h1 +h0=2*3 +2=8\n\nk2=a2*k1 +k0=2*1 +1=3\n\nConvergent2:8/3\n\nn=3:\n\nh3 =a3*h2 +h1=1*8 +3=11\n\nk3=a3*k2 +k1=1*3 +1=4\n\nConvergent3:11/4\n\nn=4:\n\nh4=a4*h3 +h2=1*11 +8=19\n\nk4=a4*k3 +k2=1*4 +3=7\n\nConvergent4:19/7\n\nn=5:\n\na5=4,\n\nh5=4*h4 +h3=4*19 +11=87\n\nk5=4*k4 +k3=4*7 +4=32\n\nConvergent5:87/32\n\nn=6:\n\na6=1,\n\nh6=1*h5 +h4=87 +19=106\n\nk6=1*k5 +k4=32 +7=39\n\nConvergent6:106/39\n\nWait, so for e's convergents, the 4th numerator is 19 (h4=19). The user says m6=19 from e convergent. Hmm, perhaps m6 refers to the 6th convergent's numerator? Let's check:\n\nConvergent6 numerator is 106, which isn't 19. Alternatively, m6 is h4? Since n=4, but m6 would be the 6th term? Hmm, perhaps the numbering is different here.\n\nWait, let's list the numerators for e's convergents:\n\nn=0:2\n\nn=1:3\n\nn=2:8\n\nn=3:11\n\nn=4:19\n\nn=5:87\n\nn=6:106\n\nSo if m6 is referring to the 6th term (n=6), that's 106, but the user says 19. Alternatively, m6 could be the 4th numerator (n=4):19. Maybe m_n for e is the nth numerator? But then m4=19, but the user says m6=19, so that would not align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe m refers to the denominator? The denominators for e:\n\nk0=1, k1=1, k2=3, k3=4, k4=7, k5=32, k6=39,...\n\nSo denominator at n=4 is 7, n=6 is 39. Not 19.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user is referring to something else. Alternatively, maybe the convergent terms for e's continued fraction have a different indexing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering the continued fraction terms (the a_n) instead of the convergents.\n\nContinued fraction terms for e are [2;1,2,1,1,4,1,1,6,...], so a0=2, a1=1, a2=2, a3=1, a4=1, a5=4, a6=1, etc. So m6 (the 6th term) would be a6=1. Not 19.\n\nAlternatively, maybe m_n is the nth term in some modified sequence related to the continued fractions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering the convergents of ln(2) and e and taking some combination? Let me see the given coefficients:\n\n9 is from ln2's m5,\n\n19 is from e's m6,\n\n45=9*5=m5*5,\n\n81=9²=m5²,\n\n83=81+2= m5²+2.\n\nSo 9 comes from ln2's m5, 19 from e's m6, then 45 is multiplying m5 by 5, 81 is m5 squared, 83 is m5 squared plus 2.\n\nSo the coefficients are constructed from previous m-values multiplied by some integers or adding.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the mathematical rule determining which coefficient to use for each n. The formulas given are for k7, k11, k16, k17, k20. Each uses a coefficient related to m-values from ln2 or e convergents. The user wants a deterministic rule that, given n (like 7,11, etc.), tells you which coefficient (like 9,19, etc.) to use, based on m-sequence values.\n\nSo perhaps the key is that for each n (like 7, 11, etc.), we need to determine whether it's related to a term in the m-sequence from ln2 or e, and then apply some operation.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nk7 = k6 + 9*k2. The coefficient 9 is m5 from ln2.\n\nk11 =k8 +19*k6. 19 is m6 from e.\n\nk16=45*k11 -465. 45 is 9*5, which is m5*5.\n\nk17=83*k11 -42. 83 is m5²+2 (since m5=9, so 81+2=83).\n\nk20=81*k14+9253. 81 is m5 squared.\n\nSo the coefficients are combinations of prior m-values. The m-values seem to be from ln2 and e's convergents.\n\nThe problem is to find a rule that, given n (like 7,11, etc.), can tell us which m-value to use (either from ln2 or e) and how to combine them (like multiplying by 5, squaring, adding 2, etc.)\n\nPerhaps each n corresponds to a certain term in the m-sequence (from ln2 or e), and the coefficient is that m-value, possibly modified by some arithmetic operation based on n.\n\nAlternatively, the coefficients are derived from the continued fraction terms of ln2 and e in a specific way.\n\nAlternatively, the n in k_n relates to the position in the m-sequence. For example, k7 uses m5 (from ln2). Maybe n=7 corresponds to m_{n-2} or something? 7-2=5? So m5? Similarly, for k11, m6 (since 11-5=6?). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's list the given formulas and see:\n\nk7 uses m5 (ln2) as 9,\n\nk11 uses m6 (e) as 19,\n\nk16 uses 45 which is 9*5 (m5*5),\n\nk17 uses 83 (m5² +2),\n\nk20 uses 81 (m5 squared).\n\nSo for n=7,11,16,17,20, the coefficients are derived from m5, m6, then combinations.\n\nPossibly there is a pattern where for certain n, the coefficient is taken from the ln2 convergent's m_n, and for others from e's m_n, and then some operations.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the indices:\n\nFor k7: coefficient m5 (from ln2's 5th term?), but how does 7 relate to 5?\n\nSimilarly, k11 uses m6 (from e?), so 11 relates to 6?\n\nAlternatively, maybe m_n for the ln2 is used when n is odd? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the m-values
