=== C-Solver Oracle Mode Analysis ===
Timestamp: Wed Dec 10 08:50:00 AM UTC 2025
Model: qwq:32b (Alibaba QwQ - 19GB reasoning model)
Mode: Oracle (streaming, no timeout)

Key Discoveries by QwQ Deep Reasoning:

1. BIT LENGTH PATTERN (confirmed):
   - Term n has exactly n bits
   - k1=1 (1-bit), k2=3 (2-bit), k3=7 (3-bit)...
   - k71 will be exactly 71 bits

2. RANGE FORMULA (verified):
   - Min = 2^(n-1), Max = 2^n - 1
   - Example: 71-bit range = [2^70, 2^71-1]

3. POSITION EXTREMES (discovered pattern):
   - k1: minimum of 1-bit range
   - k2: MAXIMUM of 2-bit range (3 is max of [2,3])
   - k3: MAXIMUM of 3-bit range (7 is max of [4,7])
   - k4: MINIMUM of 4-bit range (8 is min of [8,15])
   - k10: near minimum (514 just above 512)
   - k69: 0.72% (near minimum - solved fast!)

4. PRIME FACTORIZATIONS (analyzed):
   - k9=467 is PRIME
   - k10=514 = 2×257 (257 is prime)
   - k11=1155 = 3×5×7×11
   - k13=5765 = 5×1153

5. MULTIPLICATIVE RELATIONSHIPS (verified):
   - k5 = k2 × k3 = 3 × 7 = 21
   - k6 = k3² = 49
   - k8 = k4 × k3 × 4 = 224
   - k13 = k7² - 11 = 5765

Oracle Mode Status:
- Successful deep reasoning for ~14KB
- Model got confused by repeated instruction text in prompt
- Core insights extracted successfully

Recommendation for k71 Search:
Based on QwQ analysis, focus on:
- First 1-2% of 71-bit range (like k69 at 0.72%)
- Test candidates divisible by 71 (since 71 is prime)
- Test candidates divisible by 11 (like k69)

=== Formula Derivation Deep Session ===
Timestamp: Wed Dec 10 13:24:00 AM UTC 2025

GOAL: Derive key generation FORMULA (NOT prediction, NOT brute force)

B-SOLVER (phi4-reasoning:14b) - COMPLETED
- Task: PRNG Reconstruction
- Duration: 892 seconds (~15 minutes)
- Key Finding: Two-tier generation process
  - Tier 1 (k1-k6): Simple operations (products, squares)
  - Tier 2 (k7+): Linear combinations with fixed coefficients
  - Constants (9, 12, 13, 19) act as multipliers
- Output: prng_reconstruction_result.json (24,419 chars)

C-SOLVER (qwq:32b) - RUNNING
- Task: Formula Derivation
- Duration: 31+ minutes (still running)
- Key Discovery: 9 = k2^2 = 3^2 (first constant = k2 squared!)
- Exploring: Recurrence relations, second-order differences
- Output: formula_derivation_result.json (pending)

KEY INSIGHT FROM C-SOLVER:
The constant 9 in the equation k7 = k2*9 + k6 comes from squaring k2!
9 = 3^2 = k2^2
This suggests the other constants (12, 13, 19) may also derive from known keys.

Mathematical Relationships (Verified):
- k5 = k2 * k3 = 3 * 7 = 21
- k6 = k3^2 = 7^2 = 49
- k7 = k2*9 + k6 = k2*k2^2 + k6 = k2^3 + k3^2 = 27 + 49 = 76
- k8 = k5*13 - k6 = 21*13 - 49 = 224
- k11 = k6*19 + k8 = 49*19 + 224 = 1155
- k13 = k7^2 - 11 = 76^2 - 11 = 5765

System Status:
- Disk: 3.0TB available (14% used)
- RAM: 78GB available
- Agents running smoothly

Files Updated:
- CLAUDE.md (NEW - project status)
- oracle_logs/README.md (NEW - logging setup)
- session_log.txt (UPDATED)

=== SQLite Memory Enhancement ===
Timestamp: Wed Dec 10 13:36:00 AM UTC 2025

User requested: "add to the sqlite3 please, easier to keep and retrieve,
and make sure we auto compact the conversation so the models doesn't hit
the token limit/context?"

New Methods Added to agent_memory.py:
1. compact_conversation() - Summarizes old messages, keeps recent ones
2. get_compacted_context() - Auto-compacts when tokens exceed limit
3. save_full_oracle_output() - Saves large responses with zlib compression
4. get_full_oracle_response() - Retrieves and decompresses
5. get_db_size() - Database size info
6. vacuum_database() - Compacts SQLite file

Features:
- Auto-compression for responses >50KB
- Token limit awareness (default 8000 tokens)
- Keeps recent messages (default 5)
- Summarizes older messages before deletion

Status: Verified working

=== B-Solver PRNG Analysis COMPLETE ===
Timestamp: Wed Dec 10 13:18:51 UTC 2025
Model: phi4-reasoning:14b
Duration: 891.97 seconds (~15 minutes)
Output: prng_reconstruction_result.json (26KB)

KEY FINDINGS:
1. TWO-TIER GENERATION PROCESS:
   - Tier 1 (k1-k6): Simple operations (products, squares)
   - Tier 2 (k7+): Linear combinations with fixed coefficients

2. CONSTANTS AS MULTIPLIERS:
   - Sequence: 9, 12, 13, 19
   - k7 = 9×k2 + k6 = 27 + 49 = 76
   - k8 = 13×k5 - k6 = 273 - 49 = 224
   - k11 = 19×k6 + k8 = 931 + 224 = 1155

3. PATTERN INSIGHTS:
   - First constant 9 = k2² (3² = 9)
   - Constants may derive from previous keys
   - Algorithm mixes multiplicative and additive operations
   - Similar to pseudo-random number generator structure

4. NEXT STEPS:
   - C-Solver (QwQ 32B) still running deep formula derivation
   - Synthesize findings when C-Solver completes
---

=== C-Solver Formula Derivation COMPLETE ===
Timestamp: Dec 10 ~14:15 UTC 2025
Model: qwq:32b (streaming, no timeout)
Duration: ~81 minutes
Output: formula_derivation_result.json (99KB)

KEY DISCOVERIES FROM C-SOLVER:

1. CONSTANT 9 = k2² (MAJOR DISCOVERY!):
   - The first constant 9 in k7 = k2×9 + k6 is actually k2 SQUARED
   - 9 = 3² = k2²
   - This suggests constants are derived from previous keys

2. INDEX + OFFSET PATTERN:
   - k7 (index 7) uses constant 9 = 7 + 2
   - k8 (index 8) uses constant 13 = 8 + 5
   - k11 (index 11) uses constant 19 = 11 + 8
   - Offsets: 2, 5, 8 (possibly Fibonacci-related: 2+3=5, 5+3=8)

3. TWO-TIER GENERATION:
   - Tier 1 (k1-k6): Simple operations (products, squares)
   - Tier 2 (k7+): Linear combinations with derived constants

4. RECURRENCE EXPLORATION:
   - Tested k(n) = a×k(n-1) + b×k(n-2)
   - Got non-integer coefficients (a≈-1.217)
   - Suggests NOT a simple 2nd-order recurrence

5. DIFFERENCE ANALYSIS:
   - Differences between consecutive keys: 28,27,148,243,47,641,1528,3082
   - No obvious simple pattern
   - Searched OEIS - not a standard sequence

B-SOLVER PRNG RECONSTRUCTION FINDINGS:
- Two-tier generation confirmed
- Constants (9, 12, 13, 19) act as multipliers
- k7 = k2×9 + k6 verified
- k8 = k5×13 - k6 verified
- k11 = k6×19 + k8 verified

HYPOTHESIS TO TEST NEXT:
- Is 12 derived from k3+5 (7+5=12)?
- Is 13 derived from k4+5 (8+5=13)?
- Do offsets follow Fibonacci: 2, 5, 8, 13, 21...?
- What formula produces k9, k10, k12, k14?
---

=== NEXT QUESTIONS FOR AGENT REASONING ===
Timestamp: Dec 10 ~14:30 UTC 2025

Questions prepared for continued deep reasoning:

QUESTION SET 1: CONSTANT DERIVATION (for C-Solver)
Given: 9 = k2² = 3²
Test: Are other constants also derived from keys?
- Is 12 = k3 + 5 = 7 + 5? YES!
- Is 13 = k4 + 5 = 8 + 5? YES!
- Is 19 = k6 - 30 or k11/k? Check.
- Pattern: constants = index + offset or key_value + offset?

QUESTION SET 2: OFFSET PATTERN (for B-Solver)
Offsets used: 2, 5, 8 (for indices 7, 8, 11)
- Fibonacci check: 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...
- Note: 2, 5, 8 are NOT consecutive Fibonacci
- But differences: 5-2=3, 8-5=3 (constant!)
- Alternative: arithmetic progression with step 3?
- Predict next offset: 8+3=11?

QUESTION SET 3: MISSING FORMULAS (for both agents)
Need formulas for k9, k10, k12, k14:
- k9=467: Try k7×6+4=460 (close!), k8×2+19=467 ✓?
- k10=514: Try k9+47=514 ✓ (but trivial delta)
- k12=2683: Try k11×2+373=2683 ✓?
- k14=10544: Try k13×2-986=10544 ✓?

QUESTION SET 4: EXTENSION TO k71 (synthesis)
If we can derive formulas for k7-k14 using:
- k_n = k_a × constant + k_b
Where constant = index + offset
Can we extrapolate to k71?
- What would offset be for index 71?
- What previous keys would be used?
