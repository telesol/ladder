TASK: Derive the m[n] generation rule from n=2 to n=70

EQUATION FOR k[71]:
k[71] = 4,302,057,189,444,869,987,810 - m[71]*k[d[71]]

KNOWN DATA (computed, not assumed):
- m[n] for n=2..70 (all known)
- d[n] for n=2..70 (all known)  
- d[n] is chosen to MINIMIZE m[n] (67/69 verified)

KEY OBSERVATIONS:
- m[2]=1, m[3]=1, m[4]=22, m[5]=9, m[6]=19, m[7]=50...
- m[8] = m[2] + m[4] = 1 + 22 = 23
- m[10] = m[2] * m[6] = 1 * 19 = 19
- Many m[n] divisible by 19 when n ≡ 2 (mod 3)

QUESTION:
What mathematical RULE generates m[n]?

TEST HYPOTHESES:
1. m[n] = f(m[n-1], m[n-2], m[n-3]) - recurrence?
2. m[n] = combination of earlier m-values?
3. m[n] = mathematical constant convergent?
4. m[n] = function of n and earlier k-values?

DO NOT ASSUME - COMPUTE and VERIFY against known values!
