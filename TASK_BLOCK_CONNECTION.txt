TASK: Bitcoin Block/Transaction Connection Analysis
MODEL: Any reasoning model
TIME: Research + Analysis

## CONTEXT
The Bitcoin Puzzle was created in 2015 by a user who sent BTC to addresses
with private keys in specific bit ranges. The keys are NOT random - they
follow a pattern we've verified but haven't reconstructed.

## HYPOTHESIS
The puzzle creator used predetermined keys derived from Bitcoin blockchain data:
- Block hashes
- Transaction IDs
- Timestamps
- Merkle roots
- Or a combination

## KEY INSIGHT FROM USER
"The maker used predetermined keys to get the exact bit range for each puzzle"

This means: k[n] was CHOSEN to fall in range [2^(n-1), 2^n)

## YOUR TASK
1. Research when Bitcoin Puzzle was created (block height, date)
2. Find if k[n] values relate to:
   - Hash of block at height n
   - First n bytes of genesis block
   - Cumulative hash of blocks 1..n
   - Timestamp-derived values

3. Check specific connections:
   - Is k[n] mod 2^32 related to any block data?
   - Do the low bits of k[n] match any transaction IDs?
   - Is there a seed derivation from early Bitcoin data?

## KNOWN FACTS
- k[4] = 8 = exactly 2^3 (suspiciously round)
- k[10] = 514 = 2^9 + 2 (suspiciously sparse)
- These "clean" values suggest intentional construction, not randomness

## CONSTRAINTS
- NO BRUTE FORCE
- Focus on mathematical derivation from blockchain data
- Show explicit formulas

## OUTPUT
The derivation formula: k[n] = f(blockchain_data, n)
