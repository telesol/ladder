TASK: Derive the exact formula for m[71]

KNOWN:
- k[71] = 1,602,101,676,614,237,534,489 (derived)
- m[71] = 899,985,170,943,544,151,107
- m[71] = 19 × 47,367,640,575,976,007,953
- d[71] = 2

PATTERN from FORMULA_SUMMARY.md:
For n ≡ 2 (mod 3), m[n] often uses:
- Factor 19 (e-convergent numerator)
- Prime products: p[a] × p[b] where a+b relates to n
- Self-reference: uses earlier m-values

QUESTION: What is the exact construction formula for m[71]?

Check if: m[71] = 19 × prime(f(n, m[k]))

Provide the formula that generates m[71] = 899,985,170,943,544,151,107
