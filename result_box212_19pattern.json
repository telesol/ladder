{"model":"deepseek-math:7b","created_at":"2025-12-20T07:57:30.727070658Z","response":"**Part 1:** For which n (mod 3 = 2) is m[n] divisible by 19?\n\nFrom the given values, we have:\n\nm[6] = 19\nm[10] = 19\nm[11] = 1921 = 19 × 101\n...\nm[71] = 899,985,170,943,544,151,107 = 19 × 47,367,640,575,976,007,953\n\nWe can see that for n ≡ 2 (mod 3), the values of m[n] divisible by 19 are:\n\n* m[6] = 19\n* m[10] = 19\n* m[11] = 1921 = 19 × 101\n* m[71] = 899,985,170,943,544,151,107 = 19 × 47,367,640,575,976,007,953\n\nSo, the answer is that for n ≡ 2 (mod 3), the values of m[n] divisible by 19 are m[6], m[10], and m[11].\n\n**Part 2:** What determines when 19 appears as a factor?\n\nThe value of m[n] is determined by the e-sequence, which has a pattern of increasing by 1 in every third term. The e-sequence also converges to 0 mod 3. When n ≡ 2 (mod 3), the e-value at that index is:\n\ne[6] = 4\ne[10] = 7\ne[11] = 8\n\nAs we can see, the value of m[n] divisible by 19 coincides with the e-numerator at convergent indices. Specifically, for n ≡ 2 (mod 3), when the e-value is 4, 7, or 8, m[n] will be divisible by 19.\n\n**Part 3:** Is 47,367,640,575,976,007,953 prime? If so, what prime index?\n\nThe given value is:\n\n899,985,170,943,544,151,107 = 19 × 47,367,640,575,976,007,953\n\nSince it's divisible by 19, it's not a prime number. The prime factorization of 47,367,640,575,976,007,953 is unknown, as it's a very large composite number.\n\n**Verification:** The given values match the pattern:\n\n19 = e numerator at convergent index 4 = sqrt(3) numerator at h[4]","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[128006,882,128007,271,66913,25,26504,323,13334,279,8331,12,777,5497,304,296,7962,4474,220,32392,7736,25,296,58,21,60,284,220,777,320,68,15204,424,16149,8,296,58,605,60,284,220,777,320,25030,16715,296,58,806,60,284,220,5926,16,284,220,777,25800,220,4645,296,58,6028,60,284,220,22889,11,24961,11,8258,11,26576,11,21239,11,9690,11,7699,284,220,777,25800,220,2618,11,18775,11,14033,11,21228,11,25208,11,11194,11,25326,220,1789,308,21784,94,220,17,320,2658,220,18,1680,308,284,220,17,11,220,20,11,220,23,11,220,806,11,220,975,11,61453,220,2614,11,220,6028,9176,617,296,7824,60,76016,555,220,777,13,220,91022,25,220,16,13,1789,902,308,320,2658,220,18,284,220,17,8,374,296,7824,60,76016,555,220,777,30,220,17,13,3639,27667,994,220,777,8111,439,264,8331,30,220,18,13,2209,220,2618,11,18775,11,14033,11,21228,11,25208,11,11194,11,25326,10461,30,1442,779,11,1148,10461,1963,30,220,26504,25,220,777,284,384,64633,520,19873,16149,1963,220,19,284,18430,7,18,8,64633,520,305,58,19,60,220,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,334,5920,220,16,68063,1789,902,308,320,2658,220,18,284,220,17,8,374,296,7824,60,76016,555,220,777,1980,3915,279,2728,2819,11,584,617,1473,76,58,21,60,284,220,777,198,76,58,605,60,284,220,777,198,76,58,806,60,284,220,5926,16,284,220,777,25800,220,4645,198,9522,76,58,6028,60,284,220,22889,11,24961,11,8258,11,26576,11,21239,11,9690,11,7699,284,220,777,25800,220,2618,11,18775,11,14033,11,21228,11,25208,11,11194,11,25326,271,1687,649,1518,430,369,308,21784,94,220,17,320,2658,220,18,705,279,2819,315,296,7824,60,76016,555,220,777,527,1473,9,296,58,21,60,284,220,777,198,9,296,58,605,60,284,220,777,198,9,296,58,806,60,284,220,5926,16,284,220,777,25800,220,4645,198,9,296,58,6028,60,284,220,22889,11,24961,11,8258,11,26576,11,21239,11,9690,11,7699,284,220,777,25800,220,2618,11,18775,11,14033,11,21228,11,25208,11,11194,11,25326,271,4516,11,279,4320,374,430,369,308,21784,94,220,17,320,2658,220,18,705,279,2819,315,296,7824,60,76016,555,220,777,527,296,58,21,1145,296,58,605,1145,323,296,58,806,30662,334,5920,220,17,68063,3639,27667,994,220,777,8111,439,264,8331,1980,791,907,315,296,7824,60,374,11075,555,279,384,7962,4474,11,902,706,264,5497,315,7859,555,220,16,304,1475,4948,4751,13,578,384,7962,4474,1101,19873,4282,311,220,15,1491,220,18,13,3277,308,21784,94,220,17,320,2658,220,18,705,279,384,19625,520,430,1963,374,1473,68,58,21,60,284,220,19,198,68,58,605,60,284,220,22,198,68,58,806,60,284,220,23,271,2170,584,649,1518,11,279,907,315,296,7824,60,76016,555,220,777,23828,3422,449,279,384,32294,40622,520,19873,16149,15285,13,45863,11,369,308,21784,94,220,17,320,2658,220,18,705,994,279,384,19625,374,220,19,11,220,22,11,477,220,23,11,296,7824,60,690,387,76016,555,220,777,382,334,5920,220,18,68063,2209,220,2618,11,18775,11,14033,11,21228,11,25208,11,11194,11,25326,10461,30,1442,779,11,1148,10461,1963,1980,791,2728,907,374,1473,22889,11,24961,11,8258,11,26576,11,21239,11,9690,11,7699,284,220,777,25800,220,2618,11,18775,11,14033,11,21228,11,25208,11,11194,11,25326,271,12834,433,596,76016,555,220,777,11,433,596,539,264,10461,1396,13,578,10461,8331,2065,315,220,2618,11,18775,11,14033,11,21228,11,25208,11,11194,11,25326,374,9987,11,439,433,596,264,1633,3544,28814,1396,382,334,63439,68063,578,2728,2819,2489,279,5497,1473,777,284,384,64633,520,19873,16149,1963,220,19,284,18430,7,18,8,64633,520,305,58,19,60],"total_duration":43380157617,"load_duration":7359522259,"prompt_eval_count":238,"prompt_eval_duration":208177764,"eval_count":553,"eval_duration":35547606537}
