TASK 17: M-VALUE GROWTH ANALYSIS

KNOWN M-VALUES (from verified data):
These grow exponentially with n.

YOUR MISSION:
Analyze growth rate of m-values mathematically.

For bridges where d=1:
- m grows by factor ~2^5 = 32 per bridge (spacing of 5 bits)
- Verify this approximation
- Identify any deviations

For bridges where d=2:
- k_d = 3, so numerator/3 = m
- Larger m values expected
- Analyze growth pattern

For k85 (d=4):
- k_d = 8
- Largest m value
- Special case

MATHEMATICAL BOUNDS:
For given n and k_{n-5}:
- numerator = 2^n - (k_n - 2×k_{n-5})
- m = numerator / k_d
- What are theoretical bounds on m?

OUTPUT:
Growth analysis, bounds, mathematical patterns (no prediction).
