SWARM TASK S7: Generate Python Test Code

Create Python code to test various m-formula candidates:
1. Polynomial variants (degree 1-5)
2. Sine wave variants (different frequencies/phases)
3. Exponential/logarithmic terms
4. Combinations of above

Code should:
- Load 8 verified bridges
- Test each formula variant
- Report accuracy on each bridge
- Rank formulas by accuracy

Output: Complete Python script ready to run.
