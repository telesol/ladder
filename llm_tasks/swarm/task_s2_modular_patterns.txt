SWARM TASK S2: Modular Arithmetic Patterns in M-Values

Analyze m-values modulo various bases to find patterns:
- m mod 2^k for k=1,2,3,...,10
- m mod 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 (small primes)
- m mod k_d (should be related to remainder r)

DATA: Same 8 bridges as S1

Find deterministic modular relationships. Can we predict m mod N for any N?
