SWARM TASK S4: Remainder r Prediction

Given: r = (2^n - (k_n - 2×k_{n-5})) mod k_d

Key observation: Only k110 has r=2 (all others r=0)
k110: n=110, d=2, k_d=3, r=2

Question: Can we predict r from (n, d) alone?
- Is r related to n mod k_d?
- Is r related to 2^n mod k_d?
- Pattern in r-values?

Develop formula to predict r without knowing k_n.
