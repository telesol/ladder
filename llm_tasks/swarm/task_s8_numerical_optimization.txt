SWARM TASK S8: Numerical Coefficient Optimization

Previous formula: m ≈ 2^n/2^d × (0.43 + 0.04·sin(πn/5))
Coefficients: [0.43, 0.04]

Use gradient descent or similar to find optimal coefficients.
Try variations:
- (a + b·sin(c·n + d))
- (a + b·sin(πn/e) + f·n)

Find coefficients that minimize error on 8 bridges.
