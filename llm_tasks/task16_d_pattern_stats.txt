TASK 16: D-PATTERN STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

KNOWN D-PATTERN (k75-k130):
n:   [75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130]
d:   [1,  2,  4,  2,  1,  2,   1,   2,   1,   2,   1,   2  ]

YOUR MISSION:
1. Statistical breakdown
2. Pattern rules identification
3. Extrapolation to k135-k160

ANALYSIS:
- d=1: 6/12 = 50% (which n values?)
- d=2: 5/12 = 41.7% (which n values? Pattern?)
- d=4: 1/12 = 8.3% (only k85)

PATTERN RULES (verify):
1. d=4: Only k85 (LSB congruence)
2. d=2: Even multiples of 10 from k80 onward
3. d=1: All others (default)

EXTRAPOLATION k135-k160:
Using rules above, what d-values for k135, k140, k145, k150, k155, k160?

OUTPUT:
Predicted d-pattern k135-k160: [d135, d140, d145, d150, d155, d160]
Reasoning: [mathematical justification using verified rules]

This is MATH (applying verified rules), not prediction.
