TASK 15: MODULAR ARITHMETIC PROOF - D=2 CONDITION

CRITICAL: This is CRYPTOGRAPHY. Prove mathematically, don't guess.
Require: 100.000% accuracy or FAILURE.

VERIFIED FACT:
==============
D-selection algorithm: if n % 10 == 0 and (2*k_prev + 2^n) % 3 == 0, then d=2

YOUR MISSION:
=============
Prove this condition mathematically for ALL even multiples of 10.

MEMORY FILES:
=============
- llm_tasks/memory/verified_facts.md
- llm_tasks/memory/master_keys_70_160.json

PART 1: Test on known data
===========================
For n ∈ {80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130}:
1. Get k_{n-5} from master_keys_70_160.json
2. Compute (2×k_{n-5} + 2^n) mod 3
3. Verify result == 0
4. Get actual d from verified_facts.md
5. Report: n, k_{n-5} (last 8 hex), (2×k_{n-5} + 2^n) mod 3, d_actual, MATCH

PART 2: Mathematical proof
===========================
Prove WHY (2×k_{n-5} + 2^n) ≡ 0 (mod 3) for even multiples of 10.

Hints:
- 2^n mod 3 has pattern: 2^1≡2, 2^2≡1, 2^3≡2, 2^4≡1, ... (period 2)
- For n=10, 20, 30, ...: 2^n ≡ ?
- What must k_{n-5} mod 3 be?
- Can you prove k_{n-5} ≡ 1 (mod 3) for these cases?

PART 3: Verify on ALL data
===========================
Test condition on n ∈ {80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130}
Report: X/6 = Y% match
