TASK 2: M-Value Magnitude Pattern

QUESTION: Why are bridge m-values astronomically large compared to normal sequence?

CONTEXT:
Normal sequence (k2-k70) m-values:
- Range: 1 to ~3.4 × 10^17
- Typical: 10^3 to 10^15
- Examples: m[2]=1, m[10]=19, m[50]=395435327538483377

Bridge m-values:
- k75: m = 17,181,482,569,977,385,267,163 ≈ 1.72 × 10^22
- k80: m = 49,494,145,169,124,778,137,818 ≈ 4.95 × 10^22
- k85: m = 2,475,793,815,304,387,052,756,203 ≈ 2.48 × 10^24
- k90: m = 137,369,493,466,825,628,156,143,067 ≈ 1.37 × 10^26

MAGNITUDE COMPARISON:
- Bridge m-values are 1000x to 1,000,000x LARGER than normal sequence
- All bridges use small d-values (1, 2, 4)
- All bridges have 5-puzzle gaps before them

MASTER FORMULA:
k_n = 2*k_{n-1} + (2^n - m*k_d)

Rearranged for m:
m = (2^n - (k_n - 2*k_{n-1})) / k_d

QUESTIONS TO ANALYZE:
1. Why does using small k_d (1, 3, 13) require such large m-values?
2. Is there a relationship between gap size (5 puzzles) and m magnitude?
3. Can you derive a formula predicting m magnitude from:
   - n (puzzle number)
   - Gap size
   - d-value chosen
4. Why doesn't the minimum-m rule keep m small for bridges?

Mathematical reasoning needed:
- Growth rate analysis
- Relationship between 2^n and k_d
- Why larger k_d would give smaller m (but doesn't divide evenly)

Please provide formulas and mathematical explanation.
