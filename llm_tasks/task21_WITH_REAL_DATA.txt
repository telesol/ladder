TASK 21 RETESTED: DEEP ANALYSIS WITH **REAL DATA**

CRITICAL: This is CRYPTOGRAPHY. We need 100% accuracy or FAILURE.
Take your time. Reason deeply. This is MATH ONLY, no prediction.

================================================================================
REAL DATA (from CSV - NOT hallucinated)
================================================================================

k90 = 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000002ce00bb2136a445c71e85bf
k95 = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000527a792b183c7f64a0e8b1f4

In decimal:
k90 = 3,515,562,334,679,626,047,450,203,580,607
k95 = 6,578,125,506,315,412,872,902,170,856,948

Range for k95: [2^94, 2^95) = [19807040628566084398385987584, 39614081257132168796771975168]
k95 must be in this range.

================================================================================
PREVIOUS ATTEMPT (Task 21 original)
================================================================================

Used hallucinated k90 = 0x0E0149FA... (WRONG!)
Found that binary search needed upper-bound check.
Fix worked on fake data, FAILED on real data (m=0, negative values).

Result with real data:
- m=0 for most bridges
- Even m=0 causes k_n >= 2^n (out of range)
- Formula appears fundamentally broken

================================================================================
YOUR MISSION
================================================================================

Analyze WHY the formula fails on REAL data.

Master Formula (hypothesis):
  k_n = 2×k_{n-5} + (2^n - m×k_d)

For k95:
  n = 95
  k_{n-5} = k90 = 3,515,562,334,679,626,047,450,203,580,607
  d = 1 (from proven d-selection algorithm)
  k_d = 1

Calculate:
  2×k90 = 7,031,124,669,359,252,094,900,407,161,214
  2^95 = 39,614,081,257,132,168,796,771,975,168

Notice: 2×k90 ≈ 7.0×10^30
        2^95 ≈ 3.96×10^28

Problem: 2×k90 is MUCH LARGER than 2^95!

  k95_calc = 2×k90 + (2^95 - m×1)
           = 7.0×10^30 + 3.96×10^28 - m

Even with m = 0:
  k95_calc ≈ 7.0×10^30 >> 2^95

This is OUT OF RANGE by 100x!

================================================================================
QUESTIONS
================================================================================

1. **Is the formula structure wrong?**
   - Maybe it's not k_n = 2×k_{n-5} + (2^n - m×k_d)
   - Maybe it's k_n = something_else?
   - What formula WOULD work for this data?

2. **Work backwards from real data**:
   Given k90 and k95 (both known), what relationship do they have?

   Try:
   - k95 - 2×k90 = ?
   - k95 - k90 = ?
   - k95 / k90 = ?
   - k95 mod k90 = ?

   Look for mathematical patterns.

3. **Check if formula needs different structure**:
   - Maybe: k_n = k_{n-5} + something?
   - Maybe: k_n = (k_{n-5} * factor) + offset?
   - Maybe: k_n has no simple recurrence?

4. **Analyze the gap**:
   k95 - k90 = 6,578,125,506,315,412,872,902,170,856,948
                - 3,515,562,334,679,626,047,450,203,580,607
              = 3,062,563,171,635,786,825,451,967,276,341

   What is 3,062,563,171,635,786,825,451,967,276,341 in terms of 2^n?

   Is it close to:
   - 2^91? (≈ 2.48×10^27)
   - 2^92? (≈ 4.95×10^27)
   - 2^93? (≈ 9.90×10^27)
   - 2^94? (≈ 1.98×10^28)
   - 2^95? (≈ 3.96×10^28)

5. **Alternative hypothesis**:
   Maybe bridges are NOT calculated from previous bridges.
   Maybe they're generated independently (hash function? PRNG? construction algorithm?).

================================================================================
OUTPUT REQUIRED
================================================================================

PART 1: NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
- Calculate k95 - k90
- Calculate (k95 - k90) / 2^90
- Calculate (k95 - k90) / 2^91
- Find which power of 2 is closest to the gap

PART 2: FORMULA INVESTIGATION
- Test if k_n = k_{n-5} + 2^{something} works
- Test if k_n = k_{n-5} * ratio works
- Propose alternative formula structures

PART 3: VERDICT
Based on REAL data (not hallucinated):
- Is Master Formula salvageable? (YES/NO)
- If YES: provide corrected formula with proof
- If NO: explain why and suggest alternative approach

================================================================================
REMEMBER
================================================================================

- Use the REAL values above (k90 and k95)
- Show ALL calculations with actual numbers
- MATH ONLY - no prediction, no guessing
- 100% or FAILURE - cryptography has zero tolerance

Begin your deep analysis.
