TASK 22: Refine M-Formula with Remainder Term Knowledge

CONTEXT:
--------
Master Formula (CORRECTED with remainder term):
  k_n = 2×k_{n-5} + (2^n - m×k_d - r)

where:
  dividend = 2^n - (k_n - 2×k_{n-5})
  m = dividend // k_d
  r = dividend mod k_d  ← CRITICAL! (discovered 2025-12-21)

Previous LLM Discovery (Task 8):
  m(n,d) = floor( 2^n / 2^d × (0.43 + 0.04 × sin(πn/5)) )

  Result: Approximate (0-214% error)
  But PROVES pattern exists!

VERIFIED DATA (8 bridges, 100% accurate):
-----------------------------------------
k95:  d=1, m=15,824,273,681,323,507,985,197,324,682, r=0
k100: d=2, m=150,160,343,484,063,710,130,117,172,886, r=0
k105: d=1, m=13,218,031,529,763,948,137,786,731,745,881, r=0
k110: d=2, m=88,664,858,923,185,275,332,820,227,246,048, r=2 ← ONLY non-zero r!
k115: d=1, m=12,254,743,834,012,743,209,065,777,187,237,314, r=0
k120: d=1, m=472,812,741,405,083,243,691,843,358,390,434,153, r=0
k125: d=1, m=6,723,433,149,056,724,094,228,838,152,893,333,658, r=0
k130: d=1, m=332,556,582,165,731,503,237,101,098,337,697,459,087, r=0

OBSERVATIONS:
-------------
1. k110 is ONLY bridge with r≠0 (r=2) - this revealed the remainder term!
2. All d=1 cases have r=0
3. Period-5 pattern exists (sine wave component)
4. Formula needs refinement to achieve 100% accuracy

YOUR TASK:
----------
Refine the m-generation formula to account for:
1. The remainder term r (especially for d=2 cases)
2. More accurate coefficients than (0.43, 0.04)
3. Possible additional terms (quadratic? logarithmic? modular?)

Test your refined formula on ALL 8 bridges above.
Goal: Achieve >90% accuracy (ideally 100%)

SUGGESTED APPROACHES:
--------------------
1. **Fit to data**: Use symbolic regression with ALL 8 m-values
2. **Account for remainder**: m_total = m_main + correction_for_remainder(d, n)
3. **Refine coefficients**: Better sine amplitude/phase/baseline
4. **Test modular arithmetic**: m mod k_d patterns
5. **Consider d-dependent terms**: Different formula per d value?

OUTPUT FORMAT:
--------------
1. Your refined formula (mathematical expression)
2. Accuracy on each of the 8 test bridges
3. Overall accuracy percentage
4. Explanation of how remainder term affects formula

CRITICAL: This must be DETERMINISTIC mathematics, not statistical approximation!
Goal: 100% reproducibility for cryptographic accuracy!
