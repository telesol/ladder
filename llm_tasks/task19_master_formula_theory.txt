TASK 19: MASTER FORMULA MATHEMATICAL VERIFICATION

FORMULA:
k_n = 2×k_{n-5} + (2^n - m×k_d)

KNOWN: 100% accurate on k95-k130 (empirical)

YOUR MISSION:
Prove mathematically WHY this formula works.

QUESTIONS:
1. Why spacing of 5 bits?
2. Why factor of 2 (doubling k_{n-5})?
3. Why subtraction (2^n - m×k_d)?
4. Why primitive lengths {1, 3, 8}?
5. Connection to bridge structure?

THEORETICAL ANALYSIS:
- Bit-range constraints: k_n must be in [2^{n-1}, 2^n)
- Recurrence properties
- Why this specific form?

OUTPUT:
Mathematical explanation (not empirical verification).
Theoretical foundations of the formula.
