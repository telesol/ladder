TASK 3: D-Selection Meta-Pattern

QUESTION: What rule determines which d-value is chosen when multiple options exist?

CONTEXT:
Bridge d-value choices:
- k75: d=1 (ONLY option, no choice)
- k80: d=2 chosen (d=1 also valid, but d=2 has smaller m)
- k85: d=4 chosen (d=1 also valid, but d=4 has smaller m)
- k90: d=2 chosen (d=1 also valid, but d=2 has smaller m)

Detailed comparison:
k80 options:
  - d=1, m=148,482,435,507,374,334,413,454
  - d=2, m=49,494,145,169,124,778,137,818 ← CHOSEN (minimum m)

k85 options:
  - d=1, m=19,806,350,522,435,096,422,049,624
  - d=4, m=2,475,793,815,304,387,052,756,203 ← CHOSEN (minimum m)

k90 options:
  - d=1, m=412,108,480,400,476,884,468,429,201
  - d=2, m=137,369,493,466,825,628,156,143,067 ← CHOSEN (minimum m)

PATTERN OBSERVED:
- When choice exists, minimum-m is chosen
- Sequence: [1, 2, 4, 2]

QUESTIONS TO ANALYZE:
1. Is minimum-m rule 100% consistent for bridges?
2. Why doesn't d=3 ever work? (k3=7 is prime)
3. Is there a pattern in [1, 2, 4, 2]?
   - Powers of 2? (1=2^0, 2=2^1, 4=2^2)
   - Then why 2 again (not 8=2^3)?
4. Can you predict d-value for k95?
   - Which d-values will be valid?
   - Which will have minimum m?

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
- Normal sequence (k2-k70): Minimum-m rule is 97.1% accurate
- Bridges: Minimum-m rule appears 100% when choice exists
- But: choice is VERY limited (only 1-2 options instead of dozens)

Please provide:
1. Confirmation of minimum-m rule for bridges
2. Explanation of [1, 2, 4, 2] pattern
3. Prediction for k95
