YOU ARE NOT PREDICTING VALUES. YOU ARE DISCOVERING MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE.

====================================================================
KNOWN FACTS
====================================================================

1. K-sequence recurrence: k_n = 2×k_{n-5} + (2^n - m×k_d - r)
2. Period-5 step: Each k depends on k from 5 steps earlier
3. M-values show period-5 sinusoidal pattern: m ≈ (2^n / 2^d) × (0.43 + 0.04·sin(πn/5))
4. Five is FUNDAMENTAL to the structure

====================================================================
YOUR TASK
====================================================================

**Question**: WHY period-5? What makes 5 special?

**Investigate**:

1. **Cyclic Group Z_5**
   - Is there a Z_5 group action on the ladder?
   - Do the five positions (n mod 5) have special properties?
   - Are there 5 "types" of bridges?

2. **Galois Field GF(2^5)**
   - Bitcoin uses GF(2^256) for ECDSA
   - We found GF(2^8) for lane evolution
   - Is there a GF(2^5) structure in k-sequence?
   - Connection between 5-step recurrence and field structure?

3. **Fifth Roots of Unity**
   - The sinusoidal pattern sin(πn/5) suggests complex numbers
   - ω = e^(2πi/5) is a primitive 5th root of unity
   - Does the ladder involve ω^n computations?
   - Cyclotomic polynomial Φ_5(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1?

4. **Fermat's Little Theorem (p=5)**
   - a^5 ≡ a (mod 5) for any integer a
   - Does this relate to the 5-step structure?
   - Look at k_n mod 5 patterns

5. **Fibonacci-Like Structures**
   - Fibonacci: F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}
   - Ladder: k_n involves k_{n-5}
   - Connection to Lucas sequences with period 5?

====================================================================
MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS (DO THIS)
====================================================================

**A. Analyze k_n mod 5**
Data: k95 through k130 (8 values)
Compute: Each k_n mod 5
Question: Is there a pattern? Periodicity?

**B. Check if 5 | (k_n - 2×k_{n-5})**
For each bridge, compute numerator = k_n - 2×k_{n-5}
Check: Is numerator ≡ 0 (mod 5)?
Pattern: Does this hold for all bridges?

**C. Eigenvalue Analysis**
The recurrence can be written as:
[k_n, k_{n-1}, k_{n-2}, k_{n-3}, k_{n-4}]^T = M × [k_{n-1}, k_{n-2}, k_{n-3}, k_{n-4}, k_{n-5}]^T

Matrix M has characteristic polynomial
What are the eigenvalues? Do they involve 5th roots?

**D. Sin(πn/5) Decomposition**
sin(πn/5) takes only 10 unique values (n mod 10)
Specifically for period 5:
n ≡ 0: sin(0) = 0
n ≡ 1: sin(π/5) ≈ 0.588
n ≡ 2: sin(2π/5) ≈ 0.951
n ≡ 3: sin(3π/5) ≈ 0.951
n ≡ 4: sin(4π/5) ≈ 0.588

Does this pattern match m-values modulo something?

====================================================================
EXPECTED OUTPUT
====================================================================

Write a detailed analysis including:

1. **Numerical Results**
   - k_n mod 5 for all 8 bridges
   - Numerator mod 5 for all 8 bridges
   - Any patterns discovered

2. **Theoretical Insights**
   - Connection to cyclic groups?
   - Field structure involvement?
   - Why 5 specifically?

3. **Hypothesis**
   - What is the MATHEMATICAL REASON for period-5?
   - Can you express it as a theorem?
   - Example: "The ladder has period-5 because it is generated by..."

4. **Source Math**
   - If possible, express the ladder as a mathematical object involving period-5
   - Example: "The ladder is the orbit of k_1 under the action of..."

REMEMBER
====================================================================

You are NOT fitting curves.
You are NOT predicting values.
You ARE discovering WHY the structure exists.

Think like a pure mathematician discovering a new mathematical object!
