TASK FOR NEMOTRON-3-NANO:30B - DRIFT EVOLUTION ANALYSIS

MISSION: Discover the mathematical formula for drift evolution (k > lane×8)

==================================================

WHAT WE KNOW (100% PROVEN):

1. drift[k][lane] = 0  if k < lane × 8
2. drift[k][lane] = 1  if k == lane × 8 (for lane > 0)
3. drift[k][lane] = ?  if k > lane × 8  ← YOUR JOB!

DATA AVAILABLE: 340 evolution drift values from puzzles 1-70

==================================================

YOUR ANALYSIS TASK:

You have access to these drift values for evolution phase:
- Lane 0: 69 values (k=1 to k=69, always active)
- Lane 1: 62 values (k=9 to k=70)
- Lane 2: 54 values (k=17 to k=70)
- Lane 3: 46 values (k=25 to k=70)
- Lane 4: 38 values (k=33 to k=70)
- Lane 5: 30 values (k=41 to k=70)
- Lane 6: 22 values (k=49 to k=70)
- Lane 7: 14 values (k=57 to k=70)
- Lane 8: 6 values (k=65 to k=70)

==================================================

MATHEMATICAL PATTERNS TO FIND:

1. SEQUENTIAL PATTERNS
   - Does drift[k+1] relate to drift[k]?
   - Is there a recurrence: drift[k+1] = f(drift[k])?
   - Check differences: drift[k+1] - drift[k]

2. INDEX PATTERNS
   - Does drift relate to k itself?
   - Linear: drift = a*k + b (mod 256)?
   - Polynomial: drift = a*k^2 + b*k + c (mod 256)?
   - Exponential: drift = a^k (mod 256)?

3. LANE PATTERNS
   - Does drift relate to lane number?
   - Cross-lane: drift[k][L] = f(drift[k][L-1])?
   - Lane offset: drift = f(k - lane×8)?

4. MODULAR PATTERNS
   - Check drift mod 2, 4, 8, 16, 32
   - Check for bit patterns
   - Check for XOR relationships

5. COMBINED PATTERNS
   - drift = f(k, lane)?
   - drift = f(k mod M, lane)?
   - drift = hash(k || lane) mod 256?

==================================================

FOCUS AREAS:

LANE 0 (most data - 69 values):
Analyze the sequence deeply. This lane has data from k=1 to k=69.

Sample values:
k=1: drift=2
k=2: drift=4
k=3: drift=1
k=4: drift=13
k=5: drift=28
...

Look for:
- Is this a PRNG sequence?
- Is this a hash chain?
- Is this modular arithmetic?

ACTIVATION BOUNDARIES:
When a lane FIRST activates (k = lane×8), drift=1.
After that (k > lane×8), how does it evolve?

Check transitions:
- Lane 1: k=8 (drift=1) → k=9 (drift=?) → k=10 (drift=?)
- Lane 2: k=16 (drift=1) → k=17 (drift=?) → k=18 (drift=?)

Is there a pattern in the FIRST FEW steps after activation?

==================================================

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Please provide:

1. PATTERN HYPOTHESES
   List 3-5 concrete mathematical formulas that might work

2. EVIDENCE
   For each hypothesis, show:
   - How many values it matches
   - Accuracy percentage
   - Which lanes/k values it works for

3. BEST CANDIDATE
   Your top recommendation with:
   - The formula
   - Accuracy on test data
   - Why you think it's correct

4. NEXT STEPS
   What additional analysis would help?

==================================================

CONSTRAINTS:

- Look for EXACT formulas, not approximations
- We need 100% accuracy eventually
- Even 50-70% accuracy is valuable progress
- Document what DOESN'T work (helps others)

==================================================

REASONING APPROACH:

1. Start with SIMPLE patterns (linear, constant offsets)
2. Move to MODERATE complexity (polynomials, modular)
3. Consider COMPLEX patterns (hash, PRNG) only if simple fails
4. Use LANE 0 as primary test case (most data)
5. Validate on other lanes

==================================================

SAVE RESULTS TO:
/home/solo/LadderV3/kh-assist/llm_tasks/results/nemotron_drift_evolution_analysis.txt

Include:
- Your reasoning process
- Formulas tested
- Results and accuracy
- Recommendations

==================================================

TIME BUDGET: Take your time - thorough analysis is more important than speed.

GOOD LUCK! This is the KEY to unlocking the drift generator!
