TASK FOR GPT-OSS:120B - CROSS-LANE DRIFT VALIDATION

MISSION: Analyze cross-lane relationships in drift values

==================================================

WHAT WE KNOW:

The formula: X_{k+1}[lane] = ((X_k[lane])^n + drift[k][lane]) mod 256

Exponents: [3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3]

Proven rules:
1. drift = 0 if k < lane × 8
2. drift = 1 if k == lane × 8 (initialization)
3. drift = ??? if k > lane × 8 (evolution)

==================================================

YOUR TASK: CROSS-LANE ANALYSIS

At any given step k, we have drift values for MULTIPLE lanes.

Example at k=50:
- Lanes 0-6 are active (k >= lane×8)
- Each has a drift value

QUESTION: Are these drift values RELATED?

==================================================

HYPOTHESES TO TEST:

H1: SEQUENTIAL RELATIONSHIP
   drift[k][lane+1] = f(drift[k][lane])

   Check: Is there a formula connecting lanes at the same k?

H2: SUM/XOR RELATIONSHIP
   drift[k][lane] = (drift[k][lane-1] + C) mod 256
   drift[k][lane] = drift[k][lane-1] XOR C

   Check: Simple arithmetic relationships

H3: EXPONENT INFLUENCE
   The exponent for each lane is different.
   Does drift depend on the exponent?

   drift[k][lane] = f(exponent[lane], k)?

H4: PARITY PATTERNS
   Lanes with exponent=2 vs exponent=3

   Check: Do odd/even exponents have different drift patterns?

H5: LANE 6 SPECIAL CASE
   Lane 6 has exponent=0 (always zero X values)
   Does this create a reference point?

   drift[k][6] = ??? (check if it follows a simple pattern)

==================================================

DATA TO ANALYZE:

File: drift_data_CORRECT_BYTE_ORDER.json

Focus on k values where MANY lanes are active:
- k=40: Lanes 0-5 active (6 drift values)
- k=50: Lanes 0-6 active (7 drift values)
- k=60: Lanes 0-7 active (8 drift values)
- k=68: Lanes 0-8 active (9 drift values)

Check if drift[k] forms a VECTOR with internal structure.

==================================================

SPECIFIC TESTS:

TEST 1: Correlation Matrix
For each k with multiple active lanes, compute:
- Correlation between drift[k][i] and drift[k][i+1]
- Check for positive/negative correlation

TEST 2: Difference Patterns
For k=40 to k=70, compute:
- diff[k][lane] = drift[k][lane+1] - drift[k][lane]
- Is diff constant? Periodic? Random?

TEST 3: Lane 0 as Generator
Lane 0 is always active.
Check: Can we generate other lanes' drift from Lane 0?

drift[k][lane] = f(drift[k][0], lane)?

TEST 4: Bit Analysis
Look at drift values in binary.
Are certain bits correlated across lanes?

==================================================

OUTPUT FORMAT:

1. CORRELATION RESULTS
   - Matrix of correlations between lanes
   - Strength of relationships (weak/moderate/strong)

2. PATTERN DISCOVERIES
   - Any formulas that work
   - Accuracy percentages
   - Which k ranges they apply to

3. SPECIAL CASES
   - Lane 6 behavior
   - Exponent influence
   - Boundary effects

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
   - Should we treat lanes independently?
   - Or is there cross-lane structure to exploit?

==================================================

CONSTRAINTS:

- Use your 120B capacity for deep analysis
- Consider multiple hypotheses simultaneously
- Look for subtle patterns
- Document negative results (what doesn't work)

==================================================

SAVE RESULTS TO:
/home/solo/LadderV3/kh-assist/llm_tasks/results/gptoss_cross_lane_analysis.txt

==================================================

WHY THIS MATTERS:

If lanes are INDEPENDENT, we need 16 separate formulas.
If lanes are RELATED, we might need only 1-2 formulas!

This could dramatically simplify the drift generator.
