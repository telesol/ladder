TASK 4: Number Theory Deep Analysis

QUESTION: What fundamental number theory explains the bridge structure?

CONTEXT:
Master formula: k_n = 2*k_{n-1} + (2^n - m*k_d)

Key observations:
1. Formula involves powers of 2 (2^n, 2*k_{n-1})
2. Small primes work: k1=1, k2=3, k4=13
3. Gaps of 5 puzzles between bridges
4. Minimum-m constraint drives selection

MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES TO CONSIDER:

A. Modular Arithmetic:
   - 2^n mod k_d relationships
   - Why does 2^75 mod 3 vs 2^75 mod 7 differ?
   - Can we use Fermat's Little Theorem?

B. Prime Factorization:
   - k2 = 3 (prime)
   - k4 = 13 (prime, also a Fermat prime)
   - k3 = 7 (prime, but doesn't work for bridges!)
   - Why do some primes work and others don't?

C. Binary Representation:
   - All k-values are related to 2^n
   - Binary structure of k_d values:
     - k1 = 1 = 0b1
     - k2 = 3 = 0b11
     - k4 = 13 = 0b1101
   - Pattern in binary?

D. Diophantine Equations:
   - We need integer solutions for (d, m)
   - Constraint: (2^n - adj) ≡ 0 (mod k_d)
   - Multiple constraints when searching all d

E. Chinese Remainder Theorem:
   - Could CRT explain why certain combinations work?

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:
1. Why does k4=13 work but k3=7 doesn't for bridges?
2. Is there a formula using 2^n mod k_d to predict valid d-values?
3. Does Fermat's Little Theorem apply? (13 is Fermat prime F_2 = 2^4 + 1)
4. Can we use quadratic residues or other number theory tools?

GOAL:
Find a mathematical rule that predicts, for any bridge n:
- Which d-values will satisfy divisibility
- Which d-value will minimize m
- No brute-force search needed

Please provide deep mathematical analysis and testable predictions.
