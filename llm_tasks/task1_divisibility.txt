TASK 1: Divisibility Pattern Analysis

QUESTION: Why do only d ∈ {1, 2, 4} work for Bitcoin puzzle bridges?

CONTEXT:
We have a master formula: k_n = 2*k_{n-1} + (2^n - m*k_d)

For a valid (d, m) pair, we need:
- m must be a positive integer
- This means: (2^n - (k_n - 2*k_{n-1})) must be divisible by k_d

Known k-values:
- k1 = 1
- k2 = 3
- k3 = 7
- k4 = 13
- k5 = 21
- ... (up to k70)

Bridge Analysis Results:
- k75 (from k70): Only d=1 works (k_d = 1)
- k80 (from k75): d=1,2 work (k_d = 1, 3)
- k85 (from k80): d=1,4 work (k_d = 1, 13)
- k90 (from k85): d=1,2 work (k_d = 1, 3)

OBSERVATIONS:
1. d=1 ALWAYS works (k1 = 1 divides everything)
2. d=2 works sometimes (k2 = 3, a small prime)
3. d=4 works sometimes (k4 = 13, a small prime)
4. Larger d-values (5-70) NEVER work for bridges

QUESTION TO ANALYZE:
Why don't larger d-values work? What is special about k1=1, k2=3, k4=13?

Specifically:
1. What is the prime factorization pattern?
2. Why does (2^n - adjustment) fail to be divisible by larger k_d values?
3. Is there a modular arithmetic explanation?
4. Can you predict which d-values will work for future bridges (k95, k100, etc.)?

Please provide mathematical reasoning and, if possible, a formula or rule.
