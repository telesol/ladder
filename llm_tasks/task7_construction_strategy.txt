TASK 7: K-SEQUENCE CONSTRUCTION STRATEGY
=========================================================================

MISSION: Design a complete algorithm to CONSTRUCT k-values without database

CONTEXT:
We have discovered the master formula works perfectly:
  k_n = 2×k_{n-1} + (2^n - m×k_d)

We validated 12 bridges (k75-k130) with 100% accuracy.
We know d ∈ {1, 2, 4} is mathematical necessity.
We discovered why k85 is unique (LSB congruence).

KNOWN FACTS:
============

1. MASTER FORMULA (100% validated):
   k_n = 2×k_{n-1} + (2^n - m×k_d)

2. D-RESTRICTION (mathematically proven):
   d ∈ {1, 2, 4} only
   k_d ∈ {1, 3, 8} (from database: k1=1, k2=3, k4=8)

3. MINIMUM-M RULE (absolute):
   Choose d that minimizes m
   m = (2^n - (k_n - 2×k_{n-1})) / k_d

4. BRIDGE PATTERN (discovered):
   - Bridges occur at multiples of 5 (k75, k80, k85, ...)
   - Gaps exist (71-74, 76-79, etc.)
   - d=1 dominates (8/12 = 66.7%)
   - d=2 at even multiples of 10 (k80, k90, k100, k120)
   - d=4 ONLY at k85 (LSB congruence)

5. NUMERATOR DIVISIBILITY (from Task 6):
   numerator = 2^n - (k_n - 2×k_{n-1})
   - Divisible by 8 ONLY at k85
   - Divisible by 3 at specific bridges (k80, k90, k100, k120)
   - Default to 1 otherwise

YOUR TASK:
==========

Design a COMPLETE ALGORITHM to construct k-values from scratch.

Assume you have:
- Initial values: k1=1, k2=3, k4=8 (seed values)
- The master formula
- The minimum-m rule
- Pattern discoveries from Tasks 1-6

YOU MUST ANSWER:

PART 1: FORWARD CONSTRUCTION (k1 → k130)
-----------------------------------------

**Question 1**: Can we generate k3, k5, k6, k7, ... k70 using ONLY:
   - Master formula
   - Minimum-m rule
   - Seeds k1, k2, k4

**Question 2**: What is the ALGORITHM for non-bridge values (k71-k74)?
   - Do they follow a pattern?
   - Can they be generated or are they arbitrary?
   - Why do gaps exist?

**Question 3**: What is the ALGORITHM for bridge values (k75, k80, k85, ...)?
   - How to predict d-value for any bridge?
   - How to compute m-value?
   - Can we construct k_n without knowing k_n first?

PART 2: M-VALUE GENERATION
---------------------------

**Question 4**: How to compute m WITHOUT knowing k_n?

Current problem: m = (2^n - (k_n - 2×k_{n-1})) / k_d requires k_n

Possible solutions:
   a) Is there a formula for m directly?
   b) Can we predict m from n and d?
   c) Can we use patterns from Tasks 1-6?

**Question 5**: Can we construct m-sequence independently?
   - Pattern in m-values?
   - Recurrence relation for m?
   - Connection to n, d, k_{n-1}?

PART 3: D-SELECTION ALGORITHM
------------------------------

**Question 6**: Complete the d-selection algorithm:

```
def select_d(n, k_prev):
    """Select optimal d for bridge at position n."""

    # Step 1: Determine which d-values to test
    candidates = [1, 2, 4]  # Always valid by prime factorization

    # Step 2: For each candidate, check divisibility
    # BUT WE DON'T KNOW k_n YET!
    # How to proceed?

    # Step 3: Choose d that minimizes m
    # BUT WE CAN'T COMPUTE m WITHOUT k_n!
    # What's the solution?

    return optimal_d
```

**Question 7**: Can d-selection use ONLY previous values?
   - Can we predict d from k_{n-1} alone?
   - Can we use LSB congruence patterns?
   - Can we use n properties (parity, modulo)?

PART 4: COMPLETE CONSTRUCTION STRATEGY
---------------------------------------

**Question 8**: Design the COMPLETE algorithm:

```
def construct_k_sequence(start=1, end=130):
    """Construct entire k-sequence without database."""

    # Initialize with seeds
    k = {1: 1, 2: 3, 4: 8}

    # For each position n in range
    for n in range(5, end+1):

        # STEP 1: Determine if n is a bridge
        if is_bridge(n):  # How to determine?

            # STEP 2: Select optimal d
            d = select_d(n, k[n-5])  # How?

            # STEP 3: Compute m-value
            m = compute_m(n, d, k[n-5])  # How?

            # STEP 4: Apply master formula
            k[n] = 2*k[n-5] + (2**n - m*k_d[d])

        else:
            # Non-bridge: What algorithm?
            k[n] = ???

    return k
```

Fill in ALL missing pieces!

**Question 9**: What prevents forward construction?
   - Circular dependency: need k_n to compute m, need m to compute k_n
   - How to break this cycle?
   - Can we use inverse formula?
   - Can we use approximation then refine?

**Question 10**: Can we construct BACKWARDS?
   - Start from known k130, work backwards?
   - Use inverse formula: k_{n-1} = (k_n - (2^n - m×k_d)) / 2
   - Would this work? Why or why not?

PART 5: THEORETICAL CONSTRAINTS
--------------------------------

**Question 11**: What are the FUNDAMENTAL barriers to construction?

Identify:
   a) Mathematical barriers (circular dependencies, etc.)
   b) Information-theoretic barriers (insufficient data)
   c) Computational barriers (complexity, precision)

**Question 12**: What additional information is REQUIRED?
   - Complete m-sequence?
   - Complete d-sequence?
   - Boundary conditions?
   - Hidden parameters?

DELIVERABLES:
=============

1. **Pseudo-code algorithm** for complete k-sequence construction
2. **Identification of missing pieces** (what we can't compute yet)
3. **Mathematical analysis** of circular dependencies
4. **Proposed solutions** to break construction barriers
5. **Validation strategy** to test any proposed algorithm

CONSTRAINTS:
============

- Can use discoveries from Tasks 1-6
- Must explain WHY each step works (or why it doesn't)

DEEP REASONING REQUIRED:
=========================

This is a HARD problem. We need you to:
- Think deeply about circular dependencies
- Explore multiple solution paths
- Identify fundamental barriers
- Propose creative solutions
- Be honest about what we DON'T know

Take your time. Reason carefully. This is the core challenge of the entire project.
