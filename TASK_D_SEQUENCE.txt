# TASK: Crack the D-Sequence Pattern

## The d-sequence (n=2 to 31):
d: 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 7, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1

## Observations
- d values are small (mostly 1, 2, 4, rarely 7)
- d[10] = 7 is the largest in the first 20 terms
- d affects the formula: adj_n = 2^n - m_n × k_{d_n}

## Corresponding m-sequence:
m: 3, 7, 22, 9, 19, 50, 23, 493, 19, 1921, 1241, 8342, 2034, 26989, 8470, 138269, 255121, 564091, 900329, 670674

## Your 2-Hour Task
Find the rule that generates d_n:

1. Is d_n related to n?
   - Check: d_n = floor(log2(m_n))?
   - Check: d_n = number of set bits in n?
   - Check: d_n = some modular function of n?

2. Is d_n related to m_n?
   - Check: d_n = digit_sum(m_n) mod something?
   - Check: d_n = largest prime factor exponent?

3. Is d_n related to previous values?
   - Check: d_n = f(d_{n-1}, d_{n-2})?
   - Check: d_n = f(m_{n-1}, k_{n-1})?

4. Pattern analysis:
   - Positions where d=1: 2,3,4,9,11,13,15,16,17,18,19,23,24,26,29,30
   - Positions where d=2: 5,6,7,12,20,21,22
   - Positions where d=4: 8,14,16,27

5. Is d choosing "which previous k to reference"?
   - The formula uses k_{d_n} - is d_n an index into previous k values?

Propose a formula for d_n!
