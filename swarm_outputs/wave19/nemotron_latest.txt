I'll provide a detailed analysis for each hypothesis, following the requested structure: **ANALYZE**, **EXTEND**, **TEST**, and **CONCLUDE**.

---

### HYPOTHESIS 1: Mersenne Bootstrap

* **ANALYZE**: 
	+ Evidence Supporting: The first three keys (k[1], k[2], k[3]) perfectly match the Mersenne number sequence (2^n - 1).
	+ Contradicting Evidence: This pattern does not extend beyond k[3]; k[4] and subsequent keys do not follow the Mersenne sequence.
* **EXTEND**: 
	+ If True: We might expect to see other sequences or patterns from number theory influencing key values, possibly at specific intervals or for certain key properties.
	+ Expectation Not Met: No clear extension of Mersenne numbers is observed in later keys.
* **TEST**:
	1. **Pattern Search**: Exhaustively search the provided and potentially future keys for any return to Mersenne or similar number theoretic sequences.
	2. **Creator Statement Analysis**: Investigate if the puzzle creator has mentioned inspirations from number theory.
* **CONCLUDE**: **UNCERTAIN** (but leaning towards **FALSE** as a global pattern). While the first three keys match, the absence of this pattern in subsequent keys and lack of clear extension suggest it might be a localized design choice rather than a pervasive mechanism.

### HYPOTHESIS 2: Multiplicative Construction

* **ANALYZE**:
	+ Supporting Evidence: Several examples (k[5], k[6], k[8], k[4]) show keys as products or powers of earlier keys.
	+ Contradicting Evidence: 
		- k[7] = 76 doesn't have an obvious multiplicative relation to previous keys based on provided data.
		- k[9] = 467 is a prime number, suggesting it cannot be a product of earlier keys (except for trivial cases like k[1]=1).
* **EXTEND**:
	+ If True: All keys should have a traceable multiplicative or power relationship to earlier keys. This might hint at a deterministic, constructible nature of the puzzle.
	+ Expectation Partially Met: Some but not all examined keys fit this pattern, indicating potential for a more complex rule set.
* **TEST**:
	1. **Systematic Key Decomposition**: Attempt to factor or relate each key to its predecessors systematically.
	2. **Algorithmic Reconstruction**: Try to rebuild the sequence using only multiplicative constructions and observe discrepancies.
* **CONCLUDE**: **UNCERTAIN**. While some keys support this hypothesis, counterexamples (especially prime numbers like k[9]) suggest the puzzle's generation might be more nuanced, incorporating multiple methods.

### HYPOTHESIS 3: Transition at n=4

* **ANALYZE**:
	+ Evidence Supporting: The shift from Mersenne numbers to a different pattern after k[3] could indicate a transition.
	+ Contradicting Evidence: The significance of k[4]=8 as specifically marking this transition is not strongly supported beyond being the first non-Mersenne, power-of-2 key.
* **EXTEND**:
	+ If True: We'd expect to see a clear difference in the generation method or pattern before and after n=4. Perhaps new rules or influences emerge here.
	+ Expectation Partially Met: The Mersenne sequence ends, but the emergence of a clear, consistent new rule isn't immediately evident from provided data.
* **TEST**:
	1. **Pre/Post Analysis**: Deep dive into keys around n=4 to identify any subtle shifts in pattern or generation hints.
	2. **Rule Set Application**: Attempt to apply inferred pre-n=4 rules to post-n=4 keys and vice versa to highlight discrepancies.
* **CONCLUDE**: **UNCERTAIN** (but leaning towards **FALSE** as a distinct, pivotal transition). While n=4 marks the end of the Mersenne sequence, its significance as a global transitional point is less clear.

### HYPOTHESIS 4: Pattern Breaks are Algorithmic Transitions

* **ANALYZE**:
	+ Supporting Evidence: The breaks at n=17 and n=100 correlate with mathematically interesting numbers (Fermat prime and perfect square, respectively).
	+ Contradicting Evidence: Lack of clear evidence linking these mathematical properties to changes in the key generation algorithm.
* **EXTEND**:
	+ If True: Other pattern breaks should correspond to significant mathematical numbers or properties. The algorithm's complexity might increase at these points.
	+ Expectation Not Fully Met: Only two breaks are highlighted, without a comprehensive rule for predicting future transitions based on mathematical properties.
* **TEST**:
	1. **Mathematical Property Scan**: Systematically check if other pattern breaks in the sequence align with notable mathematical numbers or properties.
	2. **Simulated Sequence Generation**: Attempt to generate a similar sequence with intentional algorithmic changes at mathematically significant points and compare.
* **CONCLUDE**: **UNCERTAIN**. While intriguing, the hypothesis requires more evidence linking mathematical properties of break points to tangible changes in the generation algorithm.

### HYPOTHESIS 5: Recurrence Describes, Doesn’t Generate

* **ANALYZE**:
	+ Evidence Supporting: The existence of a known recurrence relation that describes but might not generate keys hints at a potentially more complex underlying method.
	+ Contradicting Evidence: Lack of direct evidence for an alternative generation method beyond the provided recurrence relation.
* **EXTEND**:
	+ If True: Investigating the actual generation method could reveal additional patterns or rules not captured by the given recurrence. This might involve non-deterministic elements.
	+ Expectation Not Met Due to Insufficient Data: The analysis cannot conclusively determine if the recurrence generates keys without more information on discrepancies between predicted and actual key values.
* **TEST**:
	1. **Predictive Modeling**: Use the provided recurrence relation to predict unseen keys and compare with actual values to identify potential deviations.
	2. **Alternative Generation Method Search**: Employ cryptanalysis techniques or machine learning to attempt discovery of a hidden generation method.
* **CONCLUDE**: **UNCERTAIN** but **PLAUSIBLE**. The possibility that the recurrence relation describes rather than generates keys is viable, especially in cryptographic contexts where obfuscation is common.

### Additional Considerations

- **Alternative Hypotheses**: Consider the intersection of number theory with computational complexity or the inclusion of non-deterministic elements (like PRNGs) influenced by specific mathematical constants or properties.
- **Simplest Explanation**: Currently, no single hypothesis fully explains all observed phenomena with simplicity and elegance, suggesting the puzzle might indeed combine multiple principles.
- **Puzzle Creator's Motivation**: Understanding the creator's background (e.g., interests in number theory, cryptography, complexity) could provide crucial context for the hypotheses.
