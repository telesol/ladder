To solve for \( k[71] - k[74] \) given the initial conditions and constraints, we need to derive the backward chain equations step by step. We'll start from \( k[75] \) and work our way back to \( k[74], k[73], \) and \( k[72] \), and then find \( k[71] \).

### Step 1: Derive the Backward Chain Equations

#### Equation for \( k[74] \):
Given:
\[ k[75] = 22538323240989823823367 \]
\[ 2^{75} = 37778931862957161709568 \]

The backward equation is:
\[ k[74] = \frac{k[75] - 2^{75} + m[75] * k[d[75]]}{2} \]

So,
\[ k[74] = \frac{22538323240989823823367 - 37778931862957161709568 + m[75] * k[d[75]]}{2} \]
\[ k[74] = \frac{-15240608621967337886201 + m[75] * k[d[75]]}{2} \]

#### Equation for \( k[73] \):
The backward equation is:
\[ k[73] = \frac{k[74] - 2^{74} + m[74] * k[d[74]]}{2} \]
\[ k[73] = \frac{k[74] - 18889465931478580854784 + m[74] * k[d[74]]}{2} \]

#### Equation for \( k[72] \):
The backward equation is:
\[ k[72] = \frac{k[73] - 2^{73} + m[73] * k[d[73]]}{2} \]
\[ k[72] = \frac{k[73] - 9444732965739290427392 + m[73] * k[d[73]]}{2} \]

#### Equation for \( k[71] \):
The backward equation is:
\[ k[71] = \frac{k[72] - 2^{72} + m[72] * k[d[72]]}{2} \]
\[ k[71] = \frac{k[72] - 4722366482869645213696 + m[72] * k[d[72]]}{2} \]

### Step 2: Verification Equation
The verification equation is:
\[ f(m[75], d[75], m[74], d[74], m[73], d[73], m[72], d[72]) = k[70] \]

Where:
\[ k[71]_{\text{forward}} = 2 * k[70] + 2^{71} - m[71] * k[d[71]] \]
We need to ensure that the \( k[71] \) derived from the backward chain equals this forward calculation.

### Step 3: Determine Free Variables and Search Space
The free variables in these equations are:
- \( m[75], d[75] \)
- \( m[74], d[74] \)
- \( m[73], d[73] \)
- \( m[72], d[72] \)

Given the distribution of \( d[n] \):
- \( d = 1 \) (43%)
- \( d = 2 \) (29%)
- \( d = 3, 4, 5 \) (21%)
- \( d > 5 \) (7%)

For each \( d[n] \), the corresponding \( k[d[n]] \) needs to be known or assumed. The values of \( m[n] \) are not strictly bounded but should be chosen such that they satisfy the c-oscillation condition.

### Step 4: Search Space Size
The search space size depends on the number of possible combinations for \( d[75], d[74], d[73], \) and \( d[72] \):
- Each \( d[n] \) has approximately 10 possibilities (since \( d > 5 \) is a small percentage, we approximate as 10).

Thus, the total number of combinations for \( d \) values is:
\[ 10^4 = 10000 \]

For each combination of \( d[n] \), there are no strict bounds on \( m[n] \), but they must be chosen such that the resulting \( k[n] \) values fall within valid ranges and satisfy the c-oscillation condition.

### Conclusion
The backward chain equations derived allow us to compute \( k[74], k[73], k[72], \) and \( k[71] \) in terms of the free variables \( m[n] \) and \( d[n] \). The verification equation ensures that the forward computation from \( k[70] \) matches the backward computation. The search space size is primarily determined by the combinations of \( d[n] \), estimated to be 10,000 based on the given distribution.
