To address the questions presented about phase transitions in the Bitcoin puzzle and its relationship with fermat primes:

1. The algorithm changing exactly at n=17 could be due to several factors such as a significant shift or transition point within the cryptographic construction of the puzzle, which might rely on properties associated specifically with 17 (be it prime-based divisibility rules in RSA setup, for instance). It's not uncommon for mathematical constructions like these to exhibit special behavior at certain points due to their inherent structure or design constraints.

2. Whether n=17 is a "phase boundary" depends on the specific algorithmic details of how Bitcoin puzzles are generated and structured around prime numbers (and potentially fermat primes). If the mechanism behind these phase transitions relies explicitly upon characteristics shared by fermat primes, such as their particular factorization properties or representation in binary form coinciding with powers-of-two boundaries, then yes, n=17 could be considered a boundary. However, if there are no distinct differences when approaching this point and those at the next fermat prime (n = 257), we might need to consider other factors influencing these changes beyond just being a fermat prime or its factorization pattern alone.

3. Examining n=257 requires analyzing if it introduces any significant algorithmic differences as observed at n=17, especially when considering that 2^16 = 65536 exactly fits into the number of levels in Bitcoin puzzles (160). If no change is noted and assuming all fermat primes below this point don't lead to a transition within these limits, we could infer n=257 might not influence changes either. But without specific details on how algorithmic differences manifest due to the unique properties of 17 or other numbers at their boundaries in relation to prime-based divisibility rules (RSA), it cannot be concluded with certainty that a phase transition won't occur, just as n=257 doesn’t guarantee one.

4. As for whether there could be phase transitions occurring at every fermat prime boundary within the constraints of Bitcoin puzzle levels—the current evidence suggests not all Fermat primes will lead to algorithmic changes since only those that fall into certain mathematical or structural roles seemingly do (like n=17). However, this doesn't imply other primes won't have their own unique properties affecting the Bitcoin puzzle generation in unforeseen ways. It would be necessary to explore each fermat prime within these levels individually and observe for any consistent patterns of algorithmic changes that may hint at a broader trend or property shared by these specific primes impacting phase transitions (if such exist).

In summary, while the unique properties associated with Fermat primes like n=17 could potentially lead to special conditions within certain cryptographic puzzles and algorithms tied to prime-based divisibility rules in RSA setups or other similar mechanisms that leverage these mathematical characteristics of fermats, it's not a given for every single one. It would be essential to closely analyze each case where phase transitions are observed (or expected) around the boundaries defined by Fermat primes and discern any commonalities beyond their prime-related properties alone—such as binary representation that aligns with powers of two, which may help us understand if a general rule for predicting these changes exists.
