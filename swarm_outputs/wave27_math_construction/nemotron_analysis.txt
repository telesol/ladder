**OUTPUT ANALYSIS**

**OBSERVATIONS:**

1. **Mersenne Phase**: For `n = 1, 2, 3`, `k[n] = 2^n - 1`.
2. **Multiplicative Phase**: For `n = 4, 5, 6, 8`, a pattern is not immediately obvious but seems to involve multiplication and adjustments based on previous terms.
3. **Prime Reset Positions**: At `n = 9, 12`, the values seem to reset or follow a distinct rule possibly related to prime numbers.
4. **Impossible Positions**: Values at `n = 8, 15, 31, 63, 71` have unique rules or behaviors.
5. **General Pattern for k[n]**: Involves `k[n-1]`, a multiplier (`2` in many cases), and adjustments based on `m[n]` and `d[n]`.
6. **Candidate Selection**: The actual `k[n]` is chosen based on an unknown criterion among multiple candidates, with `m=3` being a constant candidate not selected.

**PATTERNS:**

1. **Power of 2 Relationship**: Many `k[n]` values are either powers of 2 minus 1 (Mersenne primes for early `n`) or relate closely to powers of 2 in their construction.
2. **Multiplicative Increment**: For non-reset positions, `k[n]` often involves multiplying the previous term by a power of 2 and then adjusting based on other parameters (`m`, `d`).
3. **Periodic Reset**: The sequence resets or significantly changes behavior at prime numbers or powers of 2 minus 1.

**CONSTRUCTION PHASES:**

1. **Mersenne Phase (n = 1, 2, 3)**:
   - Rule: `k[n] = 2^n - 1`
   
2. **Multiplicative Phase (n = 4, 5, 6, 8, ...)**:
   - **Derived Rule**: `k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + adj`, where `adj` is a function of `m[n]`, `d[n]`, and possibly previous terms. Specifically observed for these `n` values: `k[4] = 2*k[3] + (2^4 - m[4]*k[d[4]])`, indicating a potential general form but requiring further clarification on `adj`.
   
3. **Prime Reset Positions (n = 9, 12, ...)**:
   - Rule: Appears to involve setting `k[n]` to a new base value related to prime numbers or their distribution, but the exact formula needs more analysis.
   
4. **Impossible Positions (n = 8, 15, 31, 63, 71, ...)**:
   - Rule: Unique rules apply, often seeming to adjust significantly from the previous term without a clear, simple multiplication pattern.

**SELECTION CRITERION:**

- **Hypothesis**: The actual `k[n]` is selected based on minimizing `m[n]` while ensuring `d[n]` and the resulting `k[n]` adhere to the sequence's constraints (e.g., staying within a certain range, maintaining mathematical relationships between terms).

**COMPUTATION FOR k[71]:**

Given `n=71` is an impossible prime reset position:
- **Step 1**: Identify `d[71]`. Given the pattern, if it follows previous impossible positions, `d[71]` might relate to a significant predecessor (e.g., `d[71] = 70`, assuming a direct relationship for simplicity).
- **Step 2**: Determine `m[71]`. The value must be chosen such that `k[71]` falls within `[2^70, 2^71)` and satisfies the sequence's constraints.
- **Hypothetical Computation** (assuming `d[71]=70`, `m[71]=3` for illustrative purposes):
  - `k[71] = 2*k[70] + 2^71 - m[71]*k[d[71]]`
  - Given the lack of explicit values for `k[70]`, `d[71]`, and `m[71]`, a precise calculation is not feasible without additional insights or clarifications on these parameters.

**VERIFICATION:**

- **Against Recurrence**: The proposed formula would need to be checked against the given recurrence relation to ensure it aligns with the mathematical structure provided.
- **Constraints**: Verification that `k[71]` falls within the specified range and adheres to any other sequence constraints is essential but currently hindered by the lack of explicit values for necessary parameters.

**LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT ANALYSIS:**

- The exact rules for multiplicative phase, prime reset positions, and impossible positions require further clarification or a deeper mathematical insight.
- The selection criterion, while hypothesized, needs confirmation through either additional provided data or a more profound understanding of the sequence's underlying mathematics.
