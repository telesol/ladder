**Initial Analysis and Reasoning**

Given the complexity of the recurrence relation and the mystery surrounding the selection of actual `k[n]`, I'll outline my thought process, identify potential breakthroughs, suggest tests for the coder, and formulate new hypotheses.

### Understanding the Recurrence Relation

1. **Exponential Growth**: The presence of `2^n` terms in equations (1) and (3) indicates exponential growth, which aligns with the observed growth rate `lambda ~ 2.0073`.
2. **Dependence on Previous Terms**: `k[n]` depends on `k[n-1]`, introducing a sequential dependency.
3. **Role of `m[n]` and `d[n]`**: `m[n]` must be an integer, and `d[n]` is chosen to minimize `|m[n]|`. This suggests that the divisibility condition (`k[d]` divides `(2^n - adj[n])`) plays a crucial role.

### Breakthroughs and Observations

* **BREAKTHROUGH:** The requirement for `m[n]` to be an integer implies that `(2^n - adj[n])` must have factors in common with `k[d[n]]`. This could hint at a underlying number theoretic property selecting `k[n]`.
* **Observation:** Given the failure of "Smallest `k[n]` in range" and "Globally smallest `|m|`", the selection might not be based solely on minimizing `k[n]` or `|m[n]|` but could involve balancing these or other factors.

### Tests for the Coder

* **TEST THIS:** 
	1. **Distribution of `d[n]`**: Analyze the distribution of `d[n]` values for `n=1..130`. Are there preferred values or patterns that could indicate how `k[n]` is selected?
	2. **Factor Analysis of `(2^n - adj[n])`**: For each `n`, examine the prime factorization of `(2^n - adj[n])` and compare it with the factors of `k[d[n]]`. This might highlight the specific number theoretic property at play.
	3. **Correlation Between `lambda` and `m[n]`/`d[n]`**: Investigate if there's a correlation between the growth rate `lambda`, the values of `m[n]`, and the choice of `d[n]`. This could suggest that `k[n]` selection influences or is influenced by the long-term growth rate.

### New Hypotheses

* **HYPOTHESIS:** **Balanced Growth and Divisibility** - The actual `k[n]` is selected to balance the immediate growth (`2*k[n-1] + 2^n`) with the requirement for `(2^n - adj[n])` to be divisible by `k[d[n]]`, ensuring both exponential growth and adherence to the divisibility condition.
* **HYPOTHESIS:** **Minimal Prime Factor Introduction** - Among valid `k[n]`, the chosen one introduces the smallest number of new prime factors into the sequence, minimizing the overall complexity of the factorizations of subsequent `(2^n - adj[n])` values.
