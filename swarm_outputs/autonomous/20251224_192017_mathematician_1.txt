Alright, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have this sequence k[n] defined by a recurrence relation involving previous terms, and there's some multiplicative structure observed. The goal is to find a formula that determines k[n] based on previous k's. 

First, let me recap the given information. The recurrence is k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n]*k[d[n]], where m[n] must be an integer. Also, adj[n] = k[n] - 2*k[n-1], and m[n] is (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]]. The d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n]| among divisors where k[d] divides (2^n - adj[n]). 

The bootstrap values start with k[1]=1, k[2]=3, k[3]=7 (which are Mersenne numbers 2^n -1). Then k[4] is 8, which is 2^3 times k[1]. For n=5, it's k[2]*k[3], so 3*7=21. Similarly, k[6]=7², k[8]=32*7=224 (which is 2^5 *k[3]). 

The multiplicative patterns here are interesting. Let's list the given k's:

n : k[n]
1 :1
2:3
3:7
4:8
5:21 (3×7)
6:49 (7²)
8:224 (32×7)
11:1155 (3×5×7×11)
17: divisible by previous k's like k[2],k[3],k[5]

Some k's like k[9]=467 are 'prime-like', meaning only divisible by k[1]=1.

Hmm, so the multiplicative structure seems to involve products of previous k's and powers of 2. Let me see if there's a pattern here. 

Starting with the bootstrap:

n=1: k[1]=1 (base case)

n=2: 3 = 2^2 -1 (Mersenne)

n=3: 7 = 2^3 -1 (Mersenne)

n=4: 8 = 2^3 * k[1] (since k[1]=1)

Wait, but 2^3 is 8, so maybe here it's just 2^{n-1}? No, n=4 would be 8 which is 2^3, so 2^{n-1}? Not sure. Let's check the other terms.

k[5] = 21 = k[2]*k[3] =3*7. 

k[6]=49 =7² =k[3]^2.

k[8]=224 = 32 *7. 32 is 2^5, and 7 is k[3]. So 2^5 *k[3].

Hmm, 2^5 is 2^(8-3)? 8-3=5, so 2^(n - 3)*k[3]. But why 3? Because d[n] here for n=8 might be 3. 

Looking at k[11]=1155, which factors into 3×5×7×11. Not sure yet. But 3 is k[2], 7 is k[3], and then 5 and 11? Wait, but k[5] is 21, so 5 isn't directly a k value. Hmm, maybe the primes in the factors are related to n? Let me see.

1155 is 3×5×7×11. The primes here are 3,5,7,11. 3 is k[2], 7 is k[3], but 5 and 11 aren't previous k's. Wait, maybe the primes are the n's? For example, n=11, so 11 is a prime, but k[11] includes 11 as a factor. Similarly, 5 isn't a previous k, but maybe 5 is part of some other relation.

Alternatively, the multiplicative structure could involve products over certain previous k terms. Let me see if there's a pattern in the indices where multiplicative combinations occur.

Looking at the examples given:

For n=5: uses n=2 and n=3 (since 2 and 3 are primes less than 5?)

For n=6: uses n=3 (3 divides 6, so maybe squares when n is multiple of previous index?)

n=8: 8 is 2^3, so maybe uses n=3 (since 8-3=5? Not sure). Alternatively, 8 is double 4, but k[4]=8, so k[8] is 2^5* k[3]. Hmm.

Alternatively, the multiplicative structure might be related to the factors of n or something else. Let me see if there's a pattern in the exponents:

Looking at k[4] = 8 = 2^3, which is 2^(4-1). But then k[5]=21=3×7. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the exponents in the multiplicative terms are related to the divisors d[n] in the recurrence. Remember the recurrence has a term m[n]*k[d[n]]. Since m[n] must be integer, and d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n]|, perhaps the multiplicative structure arises from selecting d[n] such that k[d[n]] divides (2^n - adj[n]), and the minimal m[n] leads to the product structure.

Alternatively, maybe the multiplicative structure is such that k[n] is the product of k[d] for certain divisors d of n, but that might not fit. Let's check for n=5: 5 is prime, so divisors are 1 and 5. But k[5] is product of k[2] and k[3]. Hmm, not directly divisors of 5.

Alternatively, perhaps when n is a prime, k[n] is a product of previous k's in some way. For example, n=5 is prime, so k[5]=k[2]*k[3]. Similarly, n=11 is prime, and k[11]=3×5×7×11. Wait, but 5 isn't a previous k. Hmm, maybe the factors are primes up to n? Not exactly, since 5 is part of 11's k[n] but wasn't a prior k.

Alternatively, maybe the multiplicative structure is linked to the binary representation or some other number-theoretic function. Let me think differently.

Looking at the given examples where k[n] is a product of previous k terms:

- k[5] = k[2] * k[3]

- k[6] = k[3]^2

- k[8] = 2^5 * k[3]

Wait, but 2^5 is 32. Maybe 2^(n - d[n])*k[d[n]]? For n=8, if d[n]=3, then 2^(8-3)=32, so 32 *k[3] gives 224, which matches. For n=5, if d[n] was 3, then m[n] would be (2^5 - adj[5])/k[3]. Wait adj[n] is k[n] - 2k[n-1]. Let me compute adj[5].

Given k[5]=21, 2*k[4]=16, so adj[5]=21 -16=5. Then m[5] = (2^5 -5)/k[d[5]] = (32-5)/k[d[5]] =27/k[d[5]]. To get an integer m[5], k[d[5]] must divide 27. The possible d[5] are divisors where k[d] divides 27.

Looking at previous k's up to n=4: k[1]=1, k[2]=3, k[3]=7, k[4]=8. 27 divided by which of these? 3 divides 27. 7 doesn't, 8 doesn't. So d[5] must be 2 or 1. Since d[n] minimizes |m[n]|, let's see: if d[5]=2, then m[5]=27/3=9, so m=9. If d[5]=1, m=27/1=27, so minimal is 9. So d[5]=2, m=9. Then the recurrence would give k[5] = 2*k[4]+2^5 - m[5]*k[d[5]].

Plugging in: 2*8 +32 -9*3 =16+32-27=21, which matches. Wait, but here the multiplicative structure was k[5]=k[2]*k[3], but according to the recurrence, it's built from previous terms. But in this case, choosing d=2 gives m=9, so m[n]*k[d[n]] =9*3=27, so 2k[n-1] +2^n - m*k[d] = 16+32-27=21. So the multiplicative structure here is not directly from the recurrence, but the selection of d and m leads to that result.

Hmm, so maybe the multiplicative relationships are emergent from the recurrence's constraints. Let's see another example: n=6.

k[6]=49. Let's compute adj[6]=k[6]-2k[5]=49 -42=7. Then m[6]=(2^6 -7)/k[d[6]]= (64-7)/k[d[6]]=57/k[d[6]]. Possible divisors where k[d divides 57. Previous k's up to n=5: 1,3,7,8,21. 57 divided by these: 57/3=19, 57/7≈8.14, 57/21=2.71. So possible d's are 2 (3 divides 57? 57/3=19, yes. 3 divides 57. So d[6] could be 2 or 3. Let's see which gives minimal |m|. If d=3, m=57/7≈8.14, but m must be integer. Wait, but m has to be integer. Wait, 57 divided by 7 is not integer. So actually, possible d's are those where k[d] divides 57. The divisors of 57 are 1,3,19,57. So among the previous k's, only k[2]=3 divides 57. So d[6] can be 2, giving m=57/3=19. 

Thus, k[6]=2*k[5]+2^6 -m*3. Plugging in: 2*21 +64 -19*3 =42+64-57=49. That works. But here, k[6]=49=7²=k[3]^2. So how does that relate to the recurrence? It's because m[6]*k[d[6]]=19*3=57, so 2k[5]+64-57=49.

But how does the multiplicative structure emerge here? It seems that choosing d[n] appropriately leads to k[n] being a square or product of previous terms. Maybe whenever possible, the recurrence picks d[n] such that the term m[n]*k[d[n]] is as large as possible (to minimize m[n]), leading to k[n] being formed by products of previous k terms?

Looking at n=8, let's see. k[8]=224. Let's compute adj[8]=k[8]-2k[7]. Wait, but I don't have k[7] here. Wait, the user provided up to n=130 but the example given includes up to k[11]=1155. Let me see if I can compute m[8] with given data.

Wait, maybe I need to look at the structure of the multiplicative terms. For n=8, k[8]=224. Since 224=32*7=2^5 *k[3]. Let me see if this is due to the recurrence.

Assuming k[7] is known, but since I don't have it, maybe I can think through another angle.

Alternatively, notice that in the cases where k[n] is a product of previous k terms (like n=5,6,8, etc.), those n's are not primes? Wait n=5 is prime, but it's k[2]*k[3]. Hmm. Maybe primes can be products of smaller k's, while composites might have exponents or more factors?

Alternatively, looking at the "prime-like" k's like k[9]=467. Since it's only divisible by k[1], that suggests that for n=9, the recurrence didn't allow a multiplicative combination, so it's a prime in this sequence's context. 

Perhaps the multiplicative structure is linked to the choice of d[n]. For example, when d[n] is a divisor of n, or relates to factors of n, then k[n] can be expressed as a product involving k[d[n]]. But how exactly?

Looking at n=5, d[5]=2. 2 divides 5? No, but 2 is the previous index. Maybe d[n] is the previous term's divisor? Not sure.

Alternatively, the multiplicative structure could be that k[n] is the product of k[m] for all m dividing n, but with some conditions. For example, n=6: divisors are 1,2,3,6. But k[6]=49=7², which is k[3]^2. So that doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe when n is a prime, k[n] is the product of k[p] where p are primes less than n? For n=5 (prime), product of k[2] and k[3] (both primes). For n=7, if it were a prime, would it be k[2]*k[3]*k[5]? But we don't have k[7]. Hmm, but n=11 is 3×5×7×11. Wait, but 11 is prime, but the product includes primes up to 11? Not sure.

Alternatively, the multiplicative structure is such that whenever possible, k[n] is formed by multiplying previous k terms with indices that sum to n or something. For n=5, 2+3=5. For n=6, 3+3=6 (but k[3]^2). For n=8, 3+5=8? Not sure.

Alternatively, the multiplicative terms are chosen so that m[n] is as small as possible in absolute value. Since m[n] = (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]], and adj[n] = k[n] -2k[n-1], substituting adj into m gives:

m[n] = (2^n - (k[n] - 2k[n-1])) /k[d[n]]

But from the original recurrence, k[n] = 2k[n-1] +2^n -m[n]k[d[n]]

So substituting k[n] into m[n]'s formula:

m[n] = (2^n - ( (2k[n-1] +2^n -m[n]k[d[n]] ) - 2k[n-1] )) /k[d[n]]

Simplify numerator:

2^n - ( (2k[n-1] +2^n -m[n]k[d[n]] -2k[n-1] )) 

= 2^n - (2^n -m[n]k[d[n]] ) 

= 2^n -2^n + m[n]k[d[n]] 

= m[n]k[d[n]]

Thus, m[n] = (m[n]k[d[n]] ) /k[d[n]] ) → m[n]=m[n], which is an identity. So that didn't help.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that when choosing d[n], we pick the divisor (from previous k indices) that maximizes k[d[n]], so that m[n] is minimized. Since m[n] = (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]], and adj[n] =k[n] -2k[n-1], but k[n] is dependent on m[n], it's a bit circular.

Alternatively, the user's examples suggest that whenever possible, k[n] is expressed as a product of previous terms, so perhaps the general rule is that whenever there exists a subset of previous k terms that can be multiplied/divided to form k[n], it is done so to minimize m[n]. 

But this is vague. Let's think of the problem as needing to find a general formula or pattern for k[n]. The user is asking for a process or formula that, given the recurrence and the initial conditions, allows k[n] to be expressed as products of previous terms where possible.

Alternatively, the multiplicative structure might be tied to the binary representation or other number-theoretic properties of n. For example, n=8 is 2^3, so it has a term 2^5 *k[3], but not sure.

Alternatively, let's see the given examples:

n : k[n]

1: ?

Wait, the user didn't give k[1], but let's assume initial conditions. Let's assume the first term is given. For example:

Suppose k[1] is 1 (common starting point). Then:

k[1]=1

k[2]? Let's compute it.

Wait, but without knowing the initial conditions, it's hard. Wait the problem might be from a specific context where k[n] starts with certain values. Alternatively, perhaps the user assumes standard initial conditions like k[1]=1, but let me see the given examples:

Looking at n=5, k[5]=21. If starting from k[1]=1, let's see:

Assume k[1]=1,

k[2] would be computed via recurrence. Let's try to compute step by step:

But without knowing k[1], it's tricky. Maybe the sequence starts with k[1] =1, k[2]=3 (as in the example for n=5, k[5]=21=3*7). Let me check:

Suppose k[1]=1,

Then for n=2,

We need to compute k[2]. Let's see:

adj[2] =k[2] -2k[1] =k[2]-2.

m[2] = (2^2 - adj[2])/k[d[2]] = (4 - (k[2]-2))/k[d[2]].

But recurrence is k[2]=2k[1]+2^2 - m[2]k[d[2]]

Plugging in:

k[2] = 2*1 +4 - m[2]k[d[2]] → k[2] =6 - m[2]k[d[2]]

But m[2] = (4 - (k[2]-2))/k[d[2]] = (6 -k[2])/k[d[2]]

Thus substituting m[2]:

k[2] =6 - [ (6 -k[2])/k[d[2]] ] *k[d[2]] → k[2]=6 - (6 -k[2]) → k[2]=6 -6 +k[2] → 0=0, which is a tautology. So this is not helpful. Maybe the initial terms are predefined.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is similar to a known sequence. The given k[5]=21, k[6]=49, k[8]=224, k[11]=1155. Let me see:

21 is 3*7,

49 is 7²,

224 is 32*7,

1155 factors into 5*231=5*3*77=5*3*7*11 → 3×5×7×11.

Hmm, so for n=5: primes 3 and7 (indices 2 and3),

n=6: 7²,

n=8: 2^5 (from 32) *7,

n=11: 3×5×7×11 (primes at indices 2,3,5,11?)

Wait, the primes at indices? Not sure. Alternatively, primes less than or equal to n?

Alternatively, the multiplicative terms are products of previous terms' primes or indices. Not sure.

Alternatively, the multiplicative structure is that k[n] is the product of all previous k terms for prime indices up to n? For example:

At n=5 (prime), k[5]=k[2]*k[3]

At n=7 (prime), would be k[2]*k[3]*k[5]?

But k[7] is unknown. Let's see n=11: product of k[2],k[3],k[5],k[7],k[11]? But k[11] is given as 1155, which factors into 3×5×7×11. If k[2]=3, k[3]=7, k[5]=21 (which is 3×7), then 3×5 isn't directly there. Hmm.

Alternatively, the factors correspond to the primes in their indices. For example, k[n] for prime n is the product of all previous k's at prime indices. For n=5 (prime), primes below 5 are 2 and3, so k[2]*k[3}=3×7=21. For n=7, primes below 7 are 2,3,5 so 3×7×21=441, but we don't know k[7]. For n=11, primes up to 11 are 2,3,5,7,11, so product would be 3×7×21×k[7]×k[11]. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, the multiplicative terms are related to the exponents in the prime factorization of n. Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at the factors of k[n]:

k[5]=21 =3×7,

k[6]=49=7²,

k[8]=224=2^5×7,

k[11]=1155=3×5×7×11.

So all have a factor of 7 (from k[3]), and other primes. Maybe each k[n] includes a factor of 7 from k[3], and other terms based on n's factors.

Alternatively, the multiplicative structure is that for composite n, k[n] incorporates factors from smaller terms, while primes introduce new primes. For example, n=11 introduces 11, and combines with previous primes 3,5,7.

But without more terms, it's hard to see the exact pattern.

Alternatively, the problem is expecting an answer that k[n] is the product of k[d] for all divisors d of n, or something similar. But examples don't fit that.

Alternatively, the key is that whenever possible, the recurrence chooses d[n] to be the index that allows m[n] to be an integer and minimal, leading to k[n] being a multiple of previous terms. Hence, the multiplicative relationships emerge when the division results in integer m, allowing k[n] to be expressed as 2k[n-1]+2^n minus a multiple of a previous term, thus forming products.

Given the examples, perhaps the general rule is that k[n] can be expressed as a product of previous k terms when n is one more than a prime or some other relation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the problem is to recognize that the sequence is similar to Sylvester's sequence or another known sequence, but I don't recall such.

Alternatively, the user is asking for an explanation of the multiplicative patterns observed in the examples, so perhaps the answer is that whenever possible, the term k[n] is formed by multiplying two previous terms (when indices add up to n or similar), but given the examples:

k[5] =k[2]×k[3] (indices 2+3=5),

k[6]=k[3]^2,

k[8]=k[3]×2^5 (but 2^5 is not a term),

Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, k[n] is the product of k[m] where m divides n, but for n=6, divisors are 1,2,3,6. Then product would be k[1]*k[2]*k[3]*k[6], but that's not k[6].

Alternatively, the multiplicative structure is such that k[n] = 2^{n - something} × product of previous terms. For instance, k[8]=2^5×k[3], where 5=8-3.

Similarly, k[5]=k[2]×k[3], which could be thought of as 2^{5 - (2+3)}×k[2]k[3} but exponent would be 0.

Alternatively, the exponent on 2 is n minus the sum of indices? Not sure.

Alternatively, let's note the exponents of 2 in each term:

k[5]=21 → 2^0,

k[6]=49 →2^0,

k[8]=224=2^5×7,

k[11]=1155=2^0×3×5×7×11.

Hmm, so only k[8] has a 2^5.

Alternatively, the multiplicative factors are tied to the number of times 2 is chosen in the recurrence for lower terms. For example, when calculating k[8], perhaps choosing d=3 (k[3]=7) gives a term involving 2^something.

Alternatively, since this is getting too speculative, perhaps the key is that the multiplicative structure arises because when you choose d[n] to be a previous term index, the term k[n] becomes a combination that includes factors from previous terms, thus forming products.

So the general approach is: to compute k[n], use the recurrence relation, choosing the divisor d (from previous indices) which allows m[n] to be an integer and minimal, leading to k[n] being expressed as a combination (often product) of previous terms.

Therefore, the process is iterative using the recurrence, and the multiplicative patterns emerge naturally from choosing optimal d at each step.

Given that, the answer might be that the multiplicative structure arises from the recurrence relation where each term is built by combining previous terms in a way that allows factors to carry forward, leading to products when terms are chosen to minimize m[n].

But since the user might expect a formula or specific pattern, perhaps the terms for prime indices introduce new prime factors, and composites combine previous factors.

Alternatively, the terms are the product of all previous terms plus some power of two, but not exactly.

Alternatively, looking at the factors:

k[5]=3×7 (primes 3 and7),

k[6]=7²,

k[8]=2^5×7,

k[11]=3×5×7×11.

Notice that each term includes 7 (from k[3]), and for primes beyond 3, they are introduced at their index. For example, 5 is introduced at n=5? But k[5] already has 3 and7, not 5. Wait, k[5] is 3×7, so 5 isn't there yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, the primes introduced at n are the primes less than or equal to n, but not sure.

Alternatively, the multiplicative structure is that each term k[n] for n ≥3 is 7 multiplied by something.

k[3] is 7,

k[5]=21=3×7,

k[6]=49=7²,

k[8]=224=32×7,

k[11]=1155=165×7= (3×5×11) ×7.

So, yes! Each term is 7 multiplied by another factor:

k[3] =7×1,

k[5]=7×3,

k[6]=7×7,

k[8]=7×32,

k[11]=7×165.

Thus, the multiplicative structure is that each term is 7 multiplied by another term that may have its own factors. The factor itself could be a product of previous factors or powers of 2.

Looking at the factors after 7:

For n=5: 3 (which is k[2]/1? If k[2]=3),

For n=6:7 (k[3]).

For n=8:32=2^5,

For n=11:3×5×11.

Thus, perhaps the non-7 factors are products of primes at their indices or other terms.

However, without knowing the initial terms beyond n=3, it's hard to pin down, but the key is that 7 is a persistent factor from k[3], and other primes are introduced at their respective indices.

Given the examples, the pattern seems to be that for each n, k[n] =7 multiplied by a product of some combination of previous terms or primes.

Alternatively, the multiplicative structure is that each term k[n] is equal to the product of all previous k terms divided by something, but not exactly.

Alternatively, considering the recurrence:

k[n] = 2k[n−1] + 2^n − m[n]k[d[n]]

To have k[n] be a multiple of a previous term k[d], then m[n]k[d] must equal 2k[n−1] +2^n -k[n].

If we want k[n] to be a multiple of k[d], say k[n] = m'[n]k[d], then substituting:

m'[n]k[d] = 2k[n−1] +2^n - m[n]k[d]

→ (m'[n] + m[n})k[d] = 2k[n−1] +2^n

This equation shows a relationship between m's and terms.

Alternatively, the examples suggest that choosing d[n] =3 (k[3]=7) often allows terms to be multiples of7.

For instance, k[5}=21=3×7,

k[6}=49=7×7,

k[8}=224=32×7,

k[11}=1155=165×7.

Thus, choosing d=3 (the index of 7) allows the term to be a multiple of7, which is a common factor.

Therefore, the multiplicative structure is that each term is a multiple of7 (from k[3]), and other factors are derived from the recurrence.

To generalize, after the third term, every term includes 7 as a factor, and additional factors come from the recurrence's combination of previous terms and powers of2.

Thus, the process for forming the terms involves the recurrence relation, where choosing appropriate d indices (like d=3) allows the terms to be products involving previous factors, leading to the observed multiplicative patterns.

Hence, the answer would explain that each term is generated using the recurrence and, by strategically choosing the divisor index d (such as the index of a previously introduced factor like7), the terms incorporate products of prior terms and powers of2, resulting in the multiplicative structure observed in examples like k[5]=3×7, k[6]=7², etc.
