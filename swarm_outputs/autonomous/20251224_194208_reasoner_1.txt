Thinking...
Alright, I'm trying to figure out what selects the actual k[n] given all these recurrence relations and properties. Let's start by breaking down the information provided.

First, we know that k[n] is defined by the equation k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n]*k[d[n]]. From this, adj[n] is calculated as k[n] minus twice k[n-1], so adj[n] = k[n] - 2*k[n-1]. This means that adj[n] depends directly on the previous k value and the current k.

Next, m[n] is given by (2^n - adj[n]) divided by k[d[n]], and it must be an integer. So, for each n, we have to find a divisor d[n] such that when we compute 2^n minus adj[n], it's divisible by k[d[n]]. The choice of d[n] isn't arbitrary; it's the one that minimizes the absolute value of m[n]. That seems crucial because it introduces an optimization step in selecting d[n].

Looking at the bootstrap values, k[1]=1, k[2]=3, k[3]=7. These follow the Mersenne numbers (2^n - 1), which makes sense for n=1,2,3. However, starting from n=4 onwards, things change because the growth rate lambda is approximately 2.0073, suggesting a slightly super-exponential growth.

The problem states that multiple valid k[n] satisfy the recurrence, so there must be an additional property selecting the actual one. The ruled-out points mention that choosing the smallest k in the range doesn't work for n>=5, and minimizing |m| globally fails for n>=4. Also, predicting d[n] from n alone isn't very accurate beyond 55%, which suggests that d[n] is more complex than a simple function of n.

So, what could be the missing property? Since m[n] must be an integer and d[n] minimizes |m[n]|, perhaps there's a pattern or relationship between d[n] and previous terms in the sequence. Maybe d[n] relates to the growth rate lambda somehow. The growth rate is about 2.0073, which is just above 2, so it's almost doubling each time.

Looking at the recurrence relation for k[n], we can see that as n increases, k[n] grows rapidly because of the 2^n term and the multiplicative factor in m[n]. The selection of d[n] affects how quickly or how much k[n] grows. If d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n]|, perhaps there's an optimal point where d[n] is related to the previous indices that balance growth against the constraints imposed by m[n].

Another angle: since m[n] must be integer, and it's (2^n - adj[n]) / k[d[n]], maybe there's a pattern in how d[n] is selected relative to n. For instance, could d[n] be approximately proportional to log(n) or something related to the growth rate? Or perhaps d[n] relates to previous minima in |m|.

Wait, considering that m[n] = (2^n - adj[n]) / k[d[n]], and since adj[n] is dependent on k[n], there's a recursive element here. Maybe the selection of d[n] ensures some form of stability or optimal growth rate across the sequence. If the growth rate lambda is about 2.0073, perhaps this ties into how often we're selecting certain d[n] values that keep k[n] growing at just over double each step.

I'm thinking that maybe d[n] isn't arbitrary but follows a specific pattern tied to the growth of previous k terms. Perhaps it's related to the index where k[d] is closest in value to 2^n, or some function thereof. Alternatively, maybe there's an underlying mathematical property, like prime numbers or another sequence, influencing d[n].

To test this, I could compute several terms and look for patterns in how d[n] is chosen relative to n and the growth of k[n]. For example, if we calculate m[n] and see where it's minimized, perhaps there's a recurring relationship between n and d[n], such as d[n] being roughly proportional to log(n) base 2 or something similar.

Alternatively, since the growth rate is just over 2, maybe each term k[n] relates to two previous terms in a specific way that makes d[n] either a nearby index or one that's spaced out by some rule. If we can find a consistent ratio or difference between n and d[n], it might reveal the hidden property.

In summary, the key seems to be understanding how d[n] is selected beyond just minimizing |m[n]|. It likely ties into maintaining a specific growth trajectory for k[n], perhaps connected to the growth rate lambda or some other structural property of the sequence. To find this, I need to look deeper into the relationships between n, d[n], and m[n], possibly by computing more terms or analyzing existing ones for patterns.
