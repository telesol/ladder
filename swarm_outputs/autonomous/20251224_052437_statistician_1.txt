**Initial Analysis and Reasoning**

Given the complexity of the recurrence relation and the mystery surrounding the selection of the actual `k[n]`, I'll outline my thought process, identify potential statistical approaches, and propose tests to uncover the underlying property.

### Understanding the Given Facts

1. **Recurrence Relation**: The formula for `k[n]` involves previous terms, exponential growth, and a divisive interaction with `m[n]*k[d[n]]`.
2. **Integer Constraint**: `m[n]` must be an integer, implying that `(2^n - adj[n])` is divisible by `k[d[n]]`.
3. **Minimization of `|m[n]|` for Choosing `d[n]`: This suggests an optimization principle rather than a purely random or simplistic rule.
4. **Bootstrap Values and Growth Rate**: Initial values follow a Mersenne sequence, with a growth rate (`lambda`) slightly exceeding 2.

### Insights from Ruled Out Hypotheses

* The failure of "Smallest `k[n]` in range" and "Globally smallest `|m|`" as selection criteria for `n>=4` or `n>=5`, respectively, indicates that the property might not be directly related to minimizing `k[n]` or `|m[n]|` globally.
* The low accuracy (55% max) of predicting `d[n]` from `n` alone suggests that `d[n]` is influenced by a more complex interaction involving previous `k` values.

### Statistical Analysis Plan

#### **1. Distributional Analysis**
- **TEST THIS:** Examine the distribution of `m[n]`, `adj[n]`, and `k[n]` for `n=1..130`. Specifically, assess:
	* Skewness and kurtosis of these distributions.
	* Presence of outliers or anomalies in `m[n]` that might hint at a selection mechanism.
- **HYPOTHESIS:** The distribution of `m[n]` may exhibit characteristics (e.g., heavy tails) indicative of an underlying optimization process.

#### **2. Correlation and Dependence Analysis**
- **TEST THIS:** Investigate correlations between:
	+ Sequential `k[n]` values to understand the growth pattern beyond the given lambda.
	+ `d[n]` and previous `k` values or `n`, seeking patterns that might have been overlooked in simpler predictive models.
	+ `|m[n]|` and characteristics of `k[d[n]]` or `adj[n]`.
- **HYPOTHESIS:** There exists a significant, non-obvious correlation between `d[n]` and the sequence of `k` values that informs the selection of `k[n]`.

#### **3. Comparative Analysis of `d[n]` Selection**
- **TEST THIS:** For each `n`, compare the actual `|m[n]|` with the distribution of `|m[n]|` values obtained by simulating all possible `d[n]` choices (given divisibility constraints). This could reveal if the chosen `k[n]` corresponds to an extremum or a specific quantile in this simulated distribution.
- **HYPOTHESIS:** The actual `k[n]` selection tends towards minimizing `|m[n]|` within a localized context rather than globally, possibly with an allowance for slight deviations.

#### **4. Bootstrap and Growth Rate Analysis**
- **TEST THIS:** Analyze how variations in initial bootstrap values (`k[1..3]`) affect the growth rate (`lambda`) and the emergence of any patterns in `k[n]`, `m[n]`, or `d[n]`.
- **HYPOTHESIS:** The specific choice of initial Mersenne numbers influences the observed growth rate and might be crucial for the selection property.

### Reporting Breakthroughs

As these tests are conducted, any **BREAKTHROUGH:** will be clearly reported, highlighting insights into the selecting property of `k[n]`. 

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1. Coordinate with the coder to implement "TEST THIS:" prefixed tasks.
2. Prepare statistical software environment (e.g., R, Python libraries) for analysis.
3. Review and refine hypotheses based on preliminary findings.
