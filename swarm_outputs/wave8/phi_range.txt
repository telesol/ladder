To analyze and understand how oscillations in `c[n]` can affect brute force approaches to solving ECDLPs on elliptic curves such as secp256k1, let's delve deeper into each question. We know that the puzzle involves finding a private key `k[n]` given its public counterpart which is formed by scalar multiplication of generator point `G` in this case:

Puzzle #70 might have multiple possible solutions for k[70] since it ranges from 2^59 to 2^60, but let's investigate the oscillating behavior and its implications. The 'c[n] = k[n]/2^n' values are hinting at a pattern that relates private keys with their corresponding lower bounds within their respective range intervals for each puzzle `n`.

1 & 2) Oscillation Implication: If we know the oscillating nature of c-values, this can significantly narrow down our search. For example, if ECDLP requires finding k[70], and assuming that a certain pattern or property has been established from previous data (which seems to be missing here), knowing `c[n]` for lower range values could allow us—if there's some underlying rule connecting these oscillations with elliptic curve point operations, which isn't clearly stated in the provided context.
   
   Assuming that 'k[n] is "low"', we are told to focus on [2^(n-1), 0.75*2^n]. This suggests focusing our efforts within a quarter of each range rather than its entirety, reducing computational load by half or more for large n values while still maintaining the potential validity range for private keys if patterns are consistent with historical data.
   
3) Equilibrium Concept: The notion that `c[n]` converges to some equilibrium value after reaching a certain point like puzzle #65 is intriguing but not explicit here, as no further information on the convergence mechanism or its impact on brute-force search strategies has been provided. Typically in computational problems with an oscillating sequence without external constraints (like diminishing probability of correct solutions), equilibrium isn't relevant for finding specific solution sets; instead it may relate to a statistical property like average behavior over many attempts, which could be interesting if trying to predict or analyze trends but not directly applicable when brute-forcing discrete mathematical problems.
   
4) Gap Puzzle Regularity: The regular down-up pattern observed in the gap puzzles is remarkable indeed and suggests a deliberate construction methodology that induces such behavior—potentially as an added layer of security or complexity to resist certain forms of attack strategies based on predictable patterns. It may involve some form of internal logic within these specific intervals (perhaps tied with other mathematical properties not mentioned here) which, when understood correctly, could provide insight into the distribution and likelihoods for key values that fall outside this oscillation pattern in non-gap puzzles—a possible avenue to explore if we want to exploit or further understand it.

Given just the private keys `k[n]` without additional context on ECDLP solving methods, these observations are speculative and cannot form definitive strategies for brute force attacks as they would require understanding more about underlying protocols (e.g., nonce handling in key generation) or exploiting specific weaknesses that aren't apparent here.

Finally, it is essential to recognize the enormous computational power required even with such patterns and narrowing strategies due to the vast range of possible private keys for large elliptic curves like secp256k1 used in ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) within Bitcoin cryptography. The current best known attack, as mentioned regarding the birthday paradox and generalization, requires over 4 times `n` hash operations to find a nonce with high probability using quantum computers; for elliptic curves like secp256k1 this would translate into an incredibly resource-intensive task even more so without exploiting specific properties or weaknesses unique to these instances of ECDLP.
