The provided information suggests a two-phase network that undergoes structural changes at specific points (n=9,11,12) within its evolutionary sequence from n=9 to n=67 in steps of powers of two between these phases: Phase 1 and Phase 2.

In analyzing the phase transition concerning cofactor structures changing as well as binary patterns becoming irregular or doubling followed by a distinct break, we can infer that this network may have an underlying mathematical rule guiding its growth beyond just increasing size (n). The change of cofactors from PRIME to COMPOSITE at n=12 hints towards the influence of Fermat primes in structuring these networks. Since 17 is a known Fermat prime and our network's transitions are based on powers related to it, this relationship becomes critical for understanding its behavior:

1. The cofactor structure change from PRIME (in Phase 1) to COMPOSITE (beginning in Phase 2 at n=24 when considering that a Fermat prime of the form \(2^{2^n} + 1\) is also composite if it isn't equal to -3 or any other known primes such as Mersenne primes) suggests an inherent property tied with its evolutionary rule based on powers related to 17.

2. The gap of n=12 being exactly a multiple of both the prime factors (3 and 4) within Fermat's base form implies that it could indeed be critical in understanding this transition, as networks may exhibit different growth patterns or properties when they are at specific sizes related to their underlying rules—in this case governed by powers involving the number 17.

To explore these questions further:
- The cofactor structure change from PRIME (n=9) and COMPOSITE (n=24,67), suggests that networks might be self-organizing in accordance with their size's relation to a rule based on Fermat primes. Given the pattern of growth at n=11 remains irregular but not as extreme as Phase 2—it continues without changing structure (staying PRIME) which may imply that this network does exhibit some flexibility within its transition rules, possibly hinting towards non-linear or probabilistic behavior around these critical thresholds.
  
- Regarding the special significance of n=12 in terms of Fermat primes and composite numbers: 12 is indeed a number divisible by both prime factors (3 and 4) within its decomposition but isn't itself a power related to any known form of Fermat primes. However, since it’s involved with the doubling pattern—which aligns with powers that relate directly or indirectly to n=17 as \(2^8 + 1 = 257\), which is close in magnitude but not a power related rule (it's an exponent of two plus one) and since it’s also divisible by the square root of Fermat prime 17, we could hypothesize that networks at n=12 may exhibit some form of duality or reflection symmetry—not necessarily in terms of their cofactor structures but perhaps regarding other properties such as connectivity patterns.
  
- Relating this network to the base number Fermat's prime 17, we might consider that since networks evolve by powers involving n and there is a clear relationship between these phases—the binary pattern changes could potentially mirror some aspect of how multiplicative sequences related to \(2^{n^k} + 1\) behave. Although the direct link may not be immediately obvious due to our current understanding, further analysis might reve more insights into non-linear dynamics at play and whether there are connections between these transitions and other known mathematical concepts such as modular forms or algebraic graph theory principles involving cyclotomic polynomials that often come up in connection with Fermat primes.
  
In conclusion, the transition appears to be driven by a rule deeply tied with powers of two (in relation to n) where 12 could mark an essential point for further investigation—whether it’s indeed critical or due to observed data patterns within this specific network's growth is something that would require more comprehensive mathematical modeling and empirical testing.
