Thinking...
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The task is to express each m-value from m[2] to m[10] using only the operations: addition, multiplication, power, and offset (adding or subtracting 1). The building blocks given are 1, 7, 19, 22. Let me list out the m-values first:

m[2] = 1
m[3] = 1
m[4] = 22
m[5] = 9
m[6] = 19
m[7] = 50
m[8] = 23
m[9] = 493
m[10] = 19

Wait, hold on. The user mentioned m-values 2-10 as [1, 1, 22, 9, 19, 50, 23, 493, 19]. So m[2] is 1, m[3] is 1, m[4] is 22, m[5] is 9, m,6 is 19, m[7] is 50, m[8] is 23, m[9] is 493, m[10] is 19. Got it.

Now, the known building blocks are 1, 7, 19, 22. The operations allowed are +, ×, ^, and offset (+1 or -1). So I need to use combinations of these operations with the building blocks to get each m-value. Let me tackle each m-value one by one.

Starting with m[2] = 1. Well, that's already a building block, so that's straightforward. Similarly, m[3] is 1, same thing. So those are easy.

m[4] is 22, which is a building block. So that's already given. So m[4] is just 22.

Now m[5] is 9. How can I get 9 using the building blocks 1,7,19,22 with the allowed operations. Let me think. Let's see, 7 + 1 + 1 = 9? But that would be adding 7 and two 1s. But the building blocks are 1,7,19,22. So maybe 7 + 1 + 1? But is that allowed? Wait, the problem says "using ONLY these operations on building blocks". So maybe you can use the building blocks multiple times? Or do you have to use each building block once? Wait, the problem says "using ONLY these operations on building blocks 1, 7, 19, 22". So I think you can use the building blocks as needed, combining them with the operations. So for example, 7 + 1 + 1 would be allowed, but maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, maybe 19 - something? 19 - 10 = 9, but how to get 10? 7 + 1 + 1 + 1? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 22 - 13 = 9? Not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe m[5] is 9, and perhaps there's a relation to previous terms? For example, the user mentioned self-referential building: m[7] = m[3]^2 + 1 = 7^2 + 1 = 50. So maybe there are some relations between terms. But the task is to express each m-value using the operations on the building blocks. Let me focus on m[5] first.

Let me try combinations:

- 7 + 1 + 1 = 9. But since 1 is a building block, that's allowed. So maybe that's the way. But maybe there's another way. Alternatively, 22 - 13 = 9. But how to get 13? 19 - 6? Not sure. Alternatively, 1^something? 1^anything is 1. Not helpful. Maybe 7 + (1 + 1) = 9. So that's possible. So m[5] = 7 + 1 + 1. But maybe there's a more elegant way? Let me check if that's acceptable. The problem allows using the operations on the building blocks. So yes, adding 7 and two 1s would be allowed. So maybe that's the way.

Moving on to m[6] = 19. That's a building block, so that's straightforward.

m[7] is 50, which was given as m[3]^2 + 1. Since m[3] is 1, 1^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, no. Wait the user said m[7] = m[3]^2 + 1 = 7^2 + 1 = 50. Wait, but m[3] is 1? Wait, the original problem says:

"Self-referential building:
- m[7] = m[3]^2 + 1 = 7^2 + 1 = 50
- m[8] = m[4] + 1 = 22 + 1 = 23"

Wait, but m[3] is 1? Then how does m[7] = m[3]^2 + 1 become 7^2 + 1? That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Wait, the user says:

"Known building blocks from continued fractions:
- 22 = π convergent numerator (22/7)
- 19 = e convergent (19/7) or √3 (19/11)
- 7 = π convergent denominator (22/7)

m-values 2-10: [1, 1, 22, 9, 19, 50, 23, 493, 19]

Self-referential building:
- m[7] = m[3]^2 + 1 = 7^2 + 1 = 50
- m[8] = m[4] + 1 = 22 + 1 = 23"

Wait, so m[3] is 1, but in the self-referential building, they use m[3]^2 + 1 = 7^2 + 1. That suggests that maybe there's a confusion between the m-values and the building blocks? Or perhaps there's a typo? Because if m[3] is 1, then m[3]^2 + 1 would be 1 + 1 = 2, not 50. But the user says m[7] is 50, which is 7^2 + 1. So maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, perhaps the user meant that m[3] is 7? But according to the m-values list, m[3] is 1. Hmm. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check again.

Original problem says:

"Known building blocks from continued fractions:
- 22 = π convergent numerator (22/7)
- 19 = e convergent (19/7) or √3 (19/11)
- 7 = π convergent denominator (22/7)

m-values 2-10: [1, 1, 22, 9, 19, 50, 23, 493, 19]

Self-referential building:
- m[7] = m[3]^2 + 1 = 7^2 + 1 = 50
- m[8] = m[4] + 1 = 22 + 1 = 23"

So m[3] is 1, but they use m[3]^2 + 1 as 7^2 + 1. That seems contradictory. Unless there's a typo. Maybe m[3] is supposed to be 7? But according to the m-values list, m[3] is 1. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the self-referential building. But regardless, the task is to express each m-value using the building blocks 1,7,19,22 with the allowed operations. So maybe the self-referential building is just an example, but we need to ignore that and focus on expressing each m-value using the allowed operations on the building blocks.

So for m[7] = 50. How to get 50 using 1,7,19,22. Let's think. 22 + 19 + 9? But 9 is m[5]. Wait, but we can't use previous m-values unless they are built from the building blocks. Wait, the task is to express each m-value using the building blocks and the operations. So maybe m[7] can be built from the building blocks. Let's see. 22 + 19 = 41. 41 + 7 = 48. 48 + 1 = 49. 49 + 1 = 50. So that would be 22 + 19 + 7 + 1 + 1? But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe 7^2 + 1 = 49 + 1 = 50. Wait, 7 is a building block. So 7 squared is 49, plus 1 is 50. So that works. So m[7] = 7^2 + 1. That's allowed because 7 is a building block. So that's a valid expression. So that's how m[7] is achieved. Similarly, m[8] is m[4] + 1 = 22 + 1 = 23. So m[8] is 22 + 1. So that's straightforward.

So for m[5] = 9, perhaps 7 + 1 + 1 = 9. That's possible. Let me check if that works. 7 is a building block, adding 1 (building block) twice. So yes.

Now m[9] is 493. That's a big number. Let me think. How to get 493 using the building blocks. Let's see. 493. Let me think about factors. 493 divided by 19 is 26. So 19 × 26 = 493. But how to get 26? 22 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1? That seems too many. Alternatively, 22 + 7 + 7 = 36. Not helpful. Wait, maybe 19 × (something). Let me think. 19 × 26 = 493. So 26 can be expressed as 22 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1? Or maybe 7 × 3 + 5? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 22 + 7 + 7 = 36, which is not helpful. Alternatively, 19 × (something). Let me think of other ways. Maybe using exponents. For example, 22^something? 22^2 is 484. 484 + 9 = 493. But 9 is m[5], which we already have as 7 + 1 + 1. But if we can't use previous m-values unless they are built from the building blocks. Wait, but the task is to express each m-value using the building blocks and operations. So if m[5] is built as 7 + 1 + 1, then maybe we can use that in building m[9]. But the problem says "using ONLY these operations on building blocks 1, 7, 19, 22". So perhaps we can use previous m-values as long as they are constructed from the building blocks. So for example, if m[5] is 9, then we can use 9 in building m[9]. But the problem is whether we can use m[5] as part of the expression for m[9]. But the task says to express each m-value using the operations on the building blocks, not necessarily using previous m-values. Wait, but the self-referential building examples use previous m-values. For example, m[7] is built from m[3], which is 1. So maybe the idea is that we can use previous m-values in building later ones, as long as they are constructed from the building blocks. But the problem is, how to express m[9] = 493. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe 19 × 26. How to get 26? 22 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 22 + 5 = 27. Close. Or 22 + (7 - 1) = 22 + 6 = 28. Not helpful. Alternatively, 7 × 3 + 5. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 22 + 7 + 7 = 36. Not helpful. Maybe using exponents. For example, 22 + 7^2 = 22 + 49 = 71. Not helpful. 7^3 is 343. 343 + 19 = 362. 362 + 22 = 384. Not helpful. Alternatively, 19 × 7 = 133. 133 × something? 133 × 3 = 399. 399 + 94 = 493. Not helpful. Alternatively, 19 × 26 = 493. How to get 26? Maybe 22 + (7 - 1) = 22 + 6 = 28. No. 22 + (something). Wait, 22 + (7 - 1) - 1 = 22 + 6 - 1 = 27. Still not 26. Alternatively, 7 × 3 + 5 = 26? But how to get 3 and 5? Maybe 7 - 1 - 1 = 5? So 7 × (7 - 1 - 1) + something? Wait, this seems too convoluted. Maybe there's another way. Let me think of 493. Let me check if it's a multiple of 19. 19 × 26 = 493. Yes. So 19 × 26. Now, 26 can be expressed as 22 + (7 - 1) - 1? Wait, 22 + (7 - 1) = 22 + 6 = 28. 28 - 1 = 27. Not 26. Alternatively, 22 + 7 - 3. But how to get 3? 1 + 1 + 1. So 22 + 7 - (1 + 1 + 1) = 22 + 7 - 3 = 26. So that would be 22 + 7 - 1 - 1 - 1. So putting it all together: 19 × (22 + 7 - 1 - 1 - 1). Let me calculate that: 22 +7 is 29, minus 3 is 26. 19 × 26 = 493. Yes! So that works. So m[9] = 19 × (22 + 7 - 1 - 1 - 1). But can I use that? Let me check if this uses only the allowed operations. The operations are +, ×, ^, and offset (+1, -1). So here, we have multiplication, addition, and subtraction (which is offset -1). So yes. So that's acceptable. So m[9] = 19 × (22 + 7 - 1 - 1 - 1). Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Let me think.

Alternatively, 22 + 7 = 29. 29 - 1 = 28, 28 - 1 = 27, 27 - 1 = 26. So 22 + 7 - 1 - 1 - 1. So that's 22 + 7 - 3. So yes. So that's allowed.

Now m[10] is 19, which is a building block. So that's straightforward.

Now let me check if all the m-values can be expressed this way.

Let me recap:

m[2] = 1 (building block)

m[3] = 1 (building block)

m[4] = 22 (building block)

m[5] = 7 + 1 + 1 = 9

m[6] = 19 (building block)

m[7] = 7² + 1 = 49 + 1 = 50

m[8] = 22 + 1 = 23

m[9] = 19 × (22 + 7 - 1 - 1 - 1) = 19 × 26 = 493

m[10] = 19 (building block)

So that seems to cover all m-values. Let me check each one again.

m[5] = 9: 7 + 1 + 1 = 9. Correct.

m[7] = 7² + 1. Correct.

m[8] = 22 + 1. Correct.

m[9] = 19 × (22 + 7 - 1 - 1 - 1). Let me compute the inner part: 22 + 7 = 29, 29 - 1 = 28, 28 -1 = 27, 27 -1 = 26. 19 × 26 = 493. Correct.

So all m-values can be expressed using the allowed operations and building blocks. Therefore, the answer is that each m-value can be constructed as described.
...done thinking.

To express each of the given values using only the building blocks $1$, $7$, $19$, and $22$, along with the operations $+$, $-$, $*$, and exponentiation $^$, we can proceed as follows:

---

### **1. $m[2] = 1$**
- This is a **direct building block**.

---

### **2. $m[3] = 1$**
- Again, this is a **direct building block**.

---

### **3. $m[4] = 22$**
- This is a **direct building block**.

---

### **4. $m[5] = 9$**
- We can express $9$ using the building blocks:
  $$
  m[5] = 7 + 1 + 1 = 9
  $$

---

### **5. $m[6] = 19$**
- This is a **direct building block**.

---

### **6. $m[7] = 50$**
- We can express $50$ as:
  $$
  m[7] = 7^2 + 1 = 49 + 1 = 50
  $$

---

### **7. $m[8] = 23$**
- We can express $23$ as:
  $$
  m[8] = 22 + 1 = 23
  $$

---

### **8. $m[9] = 493$**
- We can express $493$ as:
  $$
  m[9] = 19 \times (22 + 7 - 1 - 1 - 1)
  $$
  Simplify the inner expression:
  $$
  22 + 7 = 29, \quad 29 - 1 = 28, \quad 28 - 1 = 27, \quad 27 - 1 = 26
  $$
  So:
  $$
  m[9] = 19 \times 26 = 493
  $$

---

### **9. $m[10] = 19$**
- This is a **direct building block**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
All values can be constructed using the allowed operations and building blocks. Thus, the values are:

$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
m[2] &= 1 \\
m[3] &= 1 \\
m[4] &= 22 \\
m[5] &= 7 + 1 + 1 \\
m[6] &= 19 \\
m[7] &= 7^2 + 1 \\
m[8] &= 22 + 1 \\
m[9] &= 19 \times (22 + 7 - 1 - 1 - 1) \\
m[10] &= 19
\end{aligned}
}
$$
