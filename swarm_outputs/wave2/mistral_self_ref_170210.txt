 To solve this problem, let's first find the relationships between the known m-values:

1. m[3]^2 + 1 = m[7]: This means that m[3] is the square root of (m[7] - 1). Since we know that m[7] = 50, then m[3] = sqrt(49) = 7.

2. m[4] + 1 = m[8]: This means that m[4] = m[8] - 1. Since we know that m[8] = 23, then m[4] = 22.

3. Since we know m[7] and m[8], we can find m[6] using the index difference: 19 = m[6] => m[6] = 19.

Now let's try to find formulas for m[9] through m[15]:

4. Using the pattern, it seems that m[9] could be found by taking the square of an earlier m-value (similar to how we found m[3]) or using the index difference (since 68 - 49 = 19 = m[6], and 77 - 50 = 27, but there is no m[27] yet). Let's try the former approach:

- If we take the square of m[4] (which is 22), we get 484. But we don't have an m-value that equals 484, so let's try taking the square root: sqrt(484) ≈ 22.016. Rounding this value to the nearest integer gives us 22. However, there is no index difference of 22 in the given sequence (only 1, 19, and 1921). So it seems that the square root approach doesn't work for m[9].

- The next possibility could be m[9] = (m[5])^2 + 1, but since we don't know m[5], we can't verify this.

5. Moving on to m[10]: using the pattern, it seems that m[10] = (m[6])^2 + 1, which gives us 3841. However, there is no m-value that equals 3841, so we can't find a formula for m[10].

6. Similarly, for m[11], it seems that m[11] = (m[7])^2 + 1, which gives us 6561. Again, there is no m-value that equals 6561, so we can't find a formula for m[11].

7. For m[12], it seems that the index difference approach doesn't work because there is no index between 67 (m[6]) and 88 (which would correspond to an m-value of 20 = 19 + 1). The square approach also doesn't work because there is no m-value that squares to 75 (the difference between 88 and the starting index, which is 31).

8. We can't find formulas for m[13] through m[15] using the given information.

In summary:

1. Not all m-values can be expressed as functions of earlier m-values with the given operators (+, -, ×, ^, mod) and known values.

2. The only operators used are +, -, ^, and (implicitly) mod (since we're dealing with an index sequence).

3. It appears that there might be a tree structure where m[n] = f(m[ancestors]), but without knowing the functions and values for some of the m-values, it's impossible to confirm this.
