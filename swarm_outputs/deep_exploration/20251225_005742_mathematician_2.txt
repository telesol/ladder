Okay, let's tackle this Bitcoin puzzle k[n] selection mystery. Hmm, the problem states that even though there are infinitely many possible k[n] values that satisfy the recurrence relation, there's a unique one chosen based on some mathematical property. The known values and some hypotheses have already been tested, so I need to look for something else.

First, let me recap the recurrence relation: k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n]*k[d[n]]. The adjustment adj[n] is k[n] - 2*k[n-1], and m[n] is (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]], which must be an integer. The d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n]| among valid divisors. The key is figuring out what additional constraint uniquely determines k[n].

Looking at the data provided, let's see patterns in the known k values and their d[n] and m[n]. For example, d[n] often refers back to earlier terms, especially d=1,2,4. The m[n] values vary, but sometimes they are related to previous k's? Let's see:

Looking at k[4]=8. The d[4] is 1, so m[4] = (2^4 - adj[4])/k[1]. adj[4] is -6, so 16 - (-6) =22. Divided by k[1]=1 gives m=22. That's correct. 

For k[5]=21, d[5]=2. adj[5] is 5, so 2^5=32. 32-5=27, divided by k[2]=3 gives m=9. So that works. 

Now, looking at the verified facts: many k[n] for n ≥3 have 7 as a factor. For example, k[3]=7, k[6]=49 (which is 7^2), k[7]=76 (divisible by 4, not sure about 7?), wait 76 divided by 7 is 10.85... Hmm, maybe not. Wait, k[7] is 76. Let me check others. k[9]=467, which is a prime (I think), but according to the data, it's "prime-like" (coprime with all previous). Hmm, but the fact that many have 7 as a factor might be a clue.

Wait, let me look at the m values. The m[n] is (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]]. The key is that m must be integer. Since d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n]| among valid divisors (divisors of 2^n - adj[n]?), but the problem states that d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n]| among all possible divisors? Or perhaps divisors of the denominator? Wait, m must be integer, so k[d[n]] must divide (2^n - adj[n]). Therefore, the possible d[n] candidates are those indices d where k[d] divides (2^n - adj[n]).

But since adj[n] is part of the equation, there's a circular dependency here. To choose k[n], we need to know adj[n], which is part of k[n] itself. So the process must be that we select k[n] such that when we compute adj[n] =k[n]-2k[n-1], then (2^n - adj[n]) must be divisible by some k[d], and d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n]| where m[n] is that quotient. The problem is, there are infinitely many k[n] that satisfy the equation, but only one is chosen. So the key is to find a property that selects the unique k[n].

Looking at the verified facts again: the sign pattern ++- holds up to n=16 but breaks at 17 (a Fermat prime). Also, some terms like k[9],k[12],k[15] are coprime with all previous. That suggests that those terms are primes or have no common factors with prior terms, which might be part of the selection.

Another thought: maybe the chosen k[n] is the minimal positive integer possible given the constraints? But the problem says the "smallest k in range" hypothesis was wrong. Wait, but maybe minimal in some other sense?

Wait, looking at the adj values. For example, adj[4] is -6. Let's see how that plays into m[4]. Since m[n] must be integer, and d[n] is chosen to minimize |m|. For adj[4], since m[4] = (16 - (-6))/k[d[4]] = 22/k[d[4]]. Since d[4] must minimize |22/k[d]|. The possible divisors here are indices d where k[d] divides 22. The k's before n=4 are k[1]=1, k[2]=3, k[3]=7. So possible d's: k[1]=1 divides 22 (so m would be 22), k[2]=3 divides 22? 22/3 is not integer, so no. k[3]=7 divides 22? 22/7 is not. So the only possible d is 1. Hence d[4]=1, m[4]=22. So that works.

But in other cases, like n=5, let's see. adj[5] is 5. So m[5] = (32 -5)/k[d[5]] = 27/k[d[5]]. The previous k's are up to k[4]=8. So possible d's where k[d] divides 27. The possible k's are 1,3,7,8. 27 divided by 1=27, 27/3=9, 27/7 isn't integer, 27/8 no. So possible d's are 1,2 (since k[2]=3 divides 27). Then m would be 27/3=9 (d=2) or 27/1=27 (d=1). To minimize |m|, choose d=2 (since 9 <27). So that's why d[5]=2, m=9. So that makes sense.

Hmm. So the process is: given k[1] through k[n-1], compute adj[n] =k[n] - 2k[n-1]. But adj[n] is part of the equation for k[n], so it's a bit circular. The key is that for any candidate k[n], we can compute adj[n], then compute m[n] as (2^n - adj[n])/k[d], and the d[n] must be chosen as the divisor that minimizes |m[n]|. The problem is that there are infinitely many possible k[n], so how is the unique one picked?

Wait, perhaps there is an additional constraint that m[n] must be as small as possible in absolute value, but not just over the possible divisors, but also over all possible k[n] values. Wait, but the problem states that even when choosing d[n] to minimize |m[n]|, there might be multiple k[n] that lead to the same minimal |m|. Or perhaps the minimal possible |m[n]| across all possible k[n]?

Alternatively, maybe the chosen k[n] is the one that minimizes |m[n]| over all possible choices of k[n], not just over the d[n]. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the adjustment adj[n] must be as small as possible in absolute value, so that m[n] is as close to 2^n/k[d[n]] as possible. Wait, but adj[n] =k[n]-2k[n-1], so m[n] = (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]]. So m[n] = (2^n - (k[n]-2k[n-1]))/k[d[n]]. Rearranged, this gives the recurrence equation. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the chosen k[n] is the one that makes m[n] have the smallest possible absolute value, but considering all possible k[n], not just through the d[n]. But since m depends on k[n], which is being chosen, this is tricky.

Wait, let me think of it another way. For any candidate k[n], we can compute m[n] = (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]], but adj[n] is k[n]-2k[n-1], so substituting that in, m[n] = (2^n - (k[n]-2k[n-1]))/k[d[n]]. Therefore, m[n] = (2^n + 2k[n-1] - k[n])/k[d[n]]. But from the recurrence, k[n] = 2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n]*k[d[n]], so rearranged, that equation holds.

Hmm. Maybe the selection is such that the m[n] must be such that when choosing the minimal possible |m[n]|, but also ensuring that the sequence continues in a way that maintains some property, like coprimality with previous terms?

Looking at the verified fact that k[9], k[12], k[15] are "prime-like" (coprime with all previous), that might indicate that the chosen k[n] is the one that is coprime with all previous terms when possible. But how would that be enforced? Because there could be multiple candidates for k[n] that have different coprimality properties.

Alternatively, maybe the chosen k[n] is the one that is the minimal positive integer possible, given that m[n] must be integer and d[n] is chosen to minimize |m|. Wait, but the problem states that the "smallest k in range" hypothesis was wrong. Hmm.

Wait, let's look at an example where multiple k[n] might be possible. Let's pick a small n where we can compute it manually. Let's take n=3. Wait, but k[3] is given as 7. Let's see if there are other possible k[3]?

Wait for n=3, the recurrence is k[3]=2k[2] + 2^3 - m[3]*k[d[3]]. Here, k[2]=3, so 2k[2]=6. 2^3=8. So k[3] =6 +8 - m[3]*k[d[3]] =14 - m[3]*k[d[3]]. But also, adj[3]=k[3]-2k[2}=k[3]-6. Then m[3] = (8 - adj[3})/k[d[3}} = (8 - (k[3]-6))/k[d[3}} = (14 -k[3})/k[d[3}}.

Thus m[3] must be an integer, so (14 -k[3}) must be divisible by k[d[3}}. The possible d[3] can be indices 1 or 2, since those are previous terms. So d[3] must be 1 or 2.

Possible cases:

Case 1: d[3]=1. Then m[3] = (14 -k[3})/k[1}= (14 -k[3})/1 =14 -k[3}. Since m[3] must be integer (which it will be), then to minimize |m[3}|, we need to choose k[3] as close to 14 as possible. But k[3] must satisfy the equation k[3}=14 - m[3}*1. Wait, but m[3}=14-k[3}, so substituting back, k[3}=14 - (14 -k[3}) → k[3}=14 -14 +k[3} → 0=0, so that holds for any k[3}. Wait, that's circular. So if d[3}=1, then m[3}=14 -k[3}. But then the equation k[3}=14 - m[3}*1 simplifies to k[3}=14 - (14 -k[3}) → 0=0. So any k[3] is possible here? But that can't be, since m must also be an integer and d is chosen to minimize |m|.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me see:

Given that d[3] is chosen to minimize |m[3}|, where m[3}= (14 -k[3})/k[d[3}}. So for each possible d (1 or 2), compute m and pick the d that gives the minimal |m|, then choose k[3} such that m is integer?

Wait, perhaps the process is: For a given candidate k[3], you compute adj[3}=k[3}-6, then m=(8 - adj[3})/k[d}, and d must be such that k[d] divides (8 - adj[3}), and then you choose d to minimize |m|.

But the problem is that k[3} is the variable here. So for each possible k[3}, you can compute adj[3}, then see what m would be for each possible d, choose the d that minimizes |m|, then check if m is integer. The constraints are that for some d (which must be chosen to minimize |m|), m must be integer. The selected k[3} is the one that allows this minimal |m|.

But this is a bit confusing. Since k[3} is variable, how do we choose it? The problem states that there are infinitely many possible k[n], so how do we pick the unique one?

Perhaps the minimal possible |m[n}| over all possible k[n} is chosen. That is, among all possible k[n} that satisfy the equation (for some d[n}), the one with the smallest |m[n}| is selected. But then, m[n} is (2^n - adj[n})/k[d[n}}, and adj[n}=k[n} - 2k[n-1}. So substituting adj[n} into m[n}, we have m[n} = (2^n - (k[n} -2k[n-1}) ) /k[d[n}} = (2^n +2k[n-1} -k[n})/k[d[n}}.

Therefore, m[n} = (2^{n} + 2k[n-1} -k[n}) /k[d[n}}.

To minimize |m[n}|, perhaps the chosen k[n} is such that the numerator is as small as possible in absolute value? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the chosen k[n} is the one that makes m[n} an integer with the smallest possible absolute value, considering all possible d[n}. So for each possible d (all previous indices), compute what m would be if that d is chosen, then pick the d that gives the smallest |m|, and then k[n} must be chosen such that m is integer. But since m depends on k[n}, this is a bit of a loop.

Alternatively, the process could be: For each possible d from 1 to n-1, compute what k[n} would be if that d is chosen, then select the k[n} with the minimal |m[n}|. Wait, let's formalize this.

Suppose we consider all possible d from 1 to n-1:

For each d, we can write the equation k[n} = 2k[n-1} +2^n - m[n} *k[d}.

But m[n} must be such that m[n} = (2^n - adj[n})/k[d}, where adj[n}=k[n} - 2k[n-1}. Substituting adj[n} into m[n}, we get m[n} = (2^n - (k[n} -2k[n-1})) /k[d} = (2^n +2k[n-1} -k[n}) /k[d}.

Thus, solving for k[n}:

m[n}*k[d} = 2^n +2k[n-1} -k[n}

→ k[n} = 2^n +2k[n-1} - m[n}*k[d}

But that's the original recurrence. Hmm. This seems like going in circles.

Alternatively, rearranged, m[n} = (2^n +2k[n-1} -k[n}) /k[d}

So for each d, we can express m[n} in terms of k[n}. To make m an integer, (2^n + 2k[n-1} -k[n}) must be divisible by k[d}.

But k[n} is the variable here. So for each possible d, you can choose m[n} such that k[n} = 2k[n-1} +2^n - m[n}*k[d}, and then m must be an integer. The selection of d[n} is the one that gives the smallest |m[n}|, considering all possible d.

However, since m depends on k[n}, which is chosen through the equation, we need to find a k[n} such that for some d, m[n} is integer, and among all possible such d, d[n} is the one that gives the smallest |m|.

The problem is that there could be multiple k[n} leading to different m's and d's, but the selection criteria is to choose the k[n} that allows the minimal |m[n}| over all possible d's. But how do we enforce that? It might be that the minimal m is achieved by a specific k[n}.

Alternatively, perhaps the chosen k[n} is the one that makes m[n} as small as possible in absolute value, considering all possible d. That would mean, for each possible d, compute what m would be (as a function of k[n}), find the minimal possible m, then choose k[n} accordingly.

This is getting a bit abstract. Maybe looking at an example where there are multiple choices could help.

Take n=6. Let's see:

k[5]=21, so 2k[5}=42. 2^6=64. So the recurrence is k[6}=42 +64 -m[6}*k[d[6}]. So k[6}=106 -m[6}*k[d[6}].

adj[6}=k[6} -2k[5}=k[6} -42.

m[6}= (64 - adj[6}) /k[d[6}} = (64 - (k[6}-42)) /k[d[6}} = (106 -k[6}) /k[d[6}}.

We need to find d such that k[d} divides (106 -k[6}), and choose the d that minimizes |m|.

But k[6} is part of the equation. To find possible k[6}, note that for each possible d (from 1 to 5), we can set up an equation:

For each d in 1..5:

m = (106 -k[6}) /k[d}

and k[6}=106 - m*k[d}

Substituting m from the first equation into the second gives:

k[6}=106 - [(106 -k[6}) /k[d} ) *k[d} ]

Wait, that simplifies to k[6}=106 - (106 -k[6}) → k[6}=106 -106 +k[6} → 0=0. So again circular.

This suggests that for any d, as long as (106 -k[6}) is divisible by k[d}, then it's possible. But we have to choose the d that minimizes |m|, where m=(106 -k[6})/k[d}.

To find k[6}, we need to find an integer k[6} such that for some d, (106 -k[6}) is divisible by k[d}, and pick the d that gives the smallest |m|.

The actual value of k[6} is given as 7 (wait no, k[3} is 7, but let's see what k[6} is. Wait the problem didn't give us k[6}, but perhaps in the example, let's use actual numbers.

Wait the user hasn't provided the sequence beyond k[3}=7, but maybe I can use the standard sequence? Wait, actually, maybe I made a mistake in the example. Let me check the actual k[6} using the given k[5}=21.

Wait, let me look at the Fibonacci sequence? Or is this a different sequence? Wait, the problem is a general one, not necessarily Fibonacci.

Wait, perhaps in the example of n=3, the minimal m is achieved when d=2. Let's see:

For n=3, k[3}=?

We need to choose d=1 or d=2.

Suppose d=2 (k[2}=3):

m[3}= (14 -k[3}) /3.

We want m to be integer, so (14 -k[3}) must be divisible by 3. So 14 -k[3} ≡0 mod 3 → k[3} ≡14 mod3 →14 mod3 is 2, so k[3} ≡2 mod3.

Also, the recurrence equation is k[3}=14 - m*3.

So substituting m=(14 -k[3})/3 into the equation gives k[3}=14 - (14 -k[3}) → same as before.

To have m as small as possible, let's see:

If we choose d=2, then m=(14 -k[3})/3 must be integer. Let's pick k[3}=7 (which is the given value). Then m=(14-7)/3=7/3 ≈2.333, which is not integer. Wait, that contradicts?

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "You" are to solve a problem, but perhaps this is a different sequence. Maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence is defined such that d[n} is chosen to make m[n} an integer with the smallest possible absolute value, and k[n} is then determined.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is: For each n, we choose d from 1 to n-1 such that (2^n - adj[n}) is divisible by k[d}, and among all such d, pick the one with the smallest |m|, then set k[n} accordingly.

But adj[n}=k[n} - 2k[n-1}, so:

m = (2^n - (k[n} - 2k[n-1})) /k[d}

= (2^n +2k[n-1} -k[n})/k[d}

We want this to be integer, so k[d} divides (2^n +2k[n-1} -k[n}).

But k[n} is part of the equation, so it's a bit recursive.

Alternatively, maybe the idea is that for each n, you pick the d that gives the minimal possible |m|, and then k[n} is set to make m an integer with that d.

To do this, we can write m = (2^n + 2k[n-1} -k[n}) /k[d}

To minimize |m|, we can set m as close to zero as possible. So ideally, set numerator ≈0 → 2^n + 2k[n-1} -k[n} ≈0 →k[n}≈2^n +2k[n-1}. But that would give m=0/k[d}=0, but then k[n}=2^n +2k[n-1}, which is possible. But m must be integer, so if numerator is zero, then yes, m=0.

However, if we choose m=0, then k[n}=2^n +2k[n-1}, and then d can be any d since m=0, but to choose the minimal |m|, which is zero, then that's the best. But perhaps that's the case?

Wait, but in the problem statement, for example, k[3}=7. Let's see: For n=3,

k[3}=2^3 +2k[2}=8 +6=14? But the given k[3}=7, which is half of that. So that approach doesn't hold.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal |m| is achieved by a different d.

Wait let me recast for n=3:

We want m = (8 +6 -k[3}) /k[d} where d can be 1 or 2.

To minimize |m|, we can choose either d=1 or d=2.

If d=1 (k[d}=k[1}=?), but we need to know k[1}. Wait, maybe the initial terms are given? The user hasn't provided the sequence, so perhaps this approach isn't feasible without more information.

Maybe I need to think of the problem differently. The user says "You" are to solve a problem, but the initial question is unclear. Wait, looking back:
