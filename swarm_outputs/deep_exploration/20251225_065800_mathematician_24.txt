Okay, let's tackle this Bitcoin puzzle problem. Hmm, so the keys k[n] follow a recurrence relation, but there are infinitely many possibilities each time. The challenge is to find the unique property that picks the correct k[n]. The previous hypotheses like minimizing |m| globally or choosing the smallest k didn't work. Let me look at the data and see if there's a pattern.

First, let's look at the known k values. The first few are 1, 3, 7, 8, 21, 49, etc. The adj values show some fluctuations. The m[n] values are integers because m[n] = (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]], and d[n] is chosen to minimize |m|. So, for each n, m has to be an integer, and d is selected such that the divisor k[d] makes m as small as possible in absolute value.

Looking at the d values, they jump around. For example, at n=5, d=2 (since k[2]=3), n=6 also uses d=2, but n=8 uses d=4 (k[4]=8). The d's for n=10 is 7, which is k[7]=76. Wait, so d[n] must be a previous index where k[d[n]] divides (2^n - adj[n]). But adj[n] itself is k[n] - 2k[n-1], so the equation is a bit circular.

Hmm, maybe there's a connection between the previous d values and some property of k[n]? Let me think about how m[n] is calculated. Since m[n] must be an integer, (2^n - adj[n]) must be divisible by k[d[n]]. But adj[n] is part of the equation for k[n], so there's a dependency here.

Looking at the adj values, maybe there's a pattern in their signs or magnitudes? For instance, adj[4]=-6, which is negative. The adjustment can be positive or negative. The growth rate is around 2, but varies. Some k[n] are prime-like, like k[9], 12, 15 being coprime with previous terms.

Wait, the problem states that most k[n] for n≥3 have 7 as a factor. Since k[3] is 7, that might mean that k[d[n]] often is 7? But looking at the d values, sometimes they use d=1 (which is 1) or d=2 (3), or others. For example, n=9 uses d=1 (k[1]=1), so m[9] is (2^9 - adj[9])/1 = 512 -19=493? Wait, let me check the data. The adj[9] is 19, so m[9] is (512 -19)/k[1] = 493/1=493. But in the m values, m[9] is indeed 493. So that's correct.

Another idea: Maybe the choice of d[n] is not just about minimizing |m[n]|, but there's a secondary condition when multiple d's give the same minimal |m|. For instance, perhaps when there's a tie in minimal m values, they pick the earliest possible d, or some other priority?

Looking at d values: for n=5, m=9 (since m[5]=9, which is (2^5 - adj[5])/k[2], where adj[5]=5. So 32-5=27 divided by k[2]=3 gives m=9. The d here is 2. Are there other d candidates? Let's see, possible divisors of (32-5)=27. The previous k's up to n=4 are 1,3,7,8. So 27 divided by 1,3,7,8. The divisors are 1,3 (since 27 mod 7 is 6, 27 mod 8 is 3). So possible m's would be 27/1=27, 27/3=9, and 27/7≈3.85 (not integer), 27/8≈3.375. So the minimal |m| is 9, so d=2 is correct.

But in cases where there are multiple divisors with the same minimal m, perhaps they choose the smallest d? Or maybe the largest? Let's see another example.

Take n=10: m[10] is 19. Let's compute (2^10 - adj[10]) / k[d[10]]. adj[10] is -420, so 1024 - (-420) = 1444? Wait, 2^10 is 1024, adj[10] is -420, so 1024 - (-420) = 1444. Then m[10] = 1444 / k[d[10]]. Since m[10] is 19, and k[d[10]] is k[7] which is 76, so 1444 /76 is indeed 19. But why was d[10] chosen as 7? Let's see possible divisors. The numerator is 1444. The previous k's up to n=9 are 1,3,7,8,21,49,76,224,467, etc. We need to find which k[d] divides 1444 and gives minimal |m|. Let's see possible divisors:

Check if 1444 is divisible by any previous k's:

k[1] =1 → yes, m=1444/1=1444

k[2]=3 → 1444 mod 3: 1+4+4+4=13, 13 mod3 is 1, so no.

k[3]=7 → 1444 /7: 7*206=1442, so remainder 2. Not divisible.

k[4]=8 → 1444/8=180.5 → no.

k[5]=21 → 1444 /21: 21*68=1428, remainder 16. Not.

k[6]=49 → 1444/49 ≈29.47, no.

k[7]=76 → 76*19=1444. Exactly. So here, the only divisor is 76 (k[7]), so d=7 is the only possible. Hence, no choice here. But maybe for other n, there are multiple candidates and there's a tiebreaker.

Looking at n=11: m[11] is 1921. The adj[11] is 127. 2^11 is 2048. So 2048 -127 = 1921. So m[11] =1921 / k[d[11]]. d[11] is 1, so k[1]=1, so 1921/1=1921. Wait, but why not choose a different d? Let's see possible divisors of 1921. Let's check if any previous k divides 1921. For example, k[3]=7: 1921 mod7: 7*274=1918, 1921-1918=3 → no. k[5]=21? 1921/21≈91.476. Not integer. k[6]=49: 1921/49≈39.19, no. k[7]=76: 1921/76≈25.276. Not. So the only divisor is 1. So d must be 1. Hence, no other options here.

Hmm, so maybe in some cases, there are multiple d's possible. Let's look for n where there are multiple d candidates. Let me check n=4. For n=4, adj[4] is -6. 2^4 is 16. 16 - (-6)=22. So m[4] =22 /k[d[4]]. The d[4] is 1 (since k[1]=1), so m=22. But could there be another d?

Possible divisors of 22 among previous k's (up to n=3): 1,3,7. 22 divided by 1 gives 22, divided by 3 is ~7.333, not integer. Divided by 7: ~3.14, not. So only d=1 works. So again, no choice.

Wait, maybe n=7? Let's check. n=7: adj[7] is -22. 2^7 is 128. So 128 - (-22)=150. m[7]=150/k[d[7]]. The d[7] is 2, so k[2]=3, so 150/3=50. Are there other k's dividing 150? Let's see previous k's up to 6: 1,3,7,8,21,49. 150 divided by 1 → 150; by 3 →50; 7 → ~21.428; 8 →18.75; 21 → ~7.14; 49 → ~3.06. So the minimal |m| is 50, so d=2 is the only one with m=50. So again, no choice.

Hmm, maybe n=8? Let me check. n=8: adj[8]=? Wait, adj[n] is k[n]-2k[n-1]. For n=8, let's see. k[8]=224 (from data). k[7]=76. So adj[8] =224 -2*76 =224-152=72. So 2^8 is 256. Then 256 -72 =184. m[8] =184/k[d[8]]. The d[8] is 4 (k[4]=8). 184/8=23. Let's see other possible divisors. Previous k's up to 7: 1,3,7,8,21,49,76. 184 divided by 1 is 184; 3 → ~61.3; 7→26.28; 8→23; 21→8.76; 49→3.755; 76→2.42. So the minimal m is 23, so d=4 is the only one that gives m=23. So again only one possible.

Hmm, maybe there are cases where two different k[d] can give the same |m|. Let's see for n=5 again. Wait, n=5: adj[5] is 5. 2^5=32. So 32-5=27. m=27/k[d]. The possible divisors of 27 are 1 and 3 (k[1]=1, k[2]=3). So m can be 27 or 9. So the minimal is 9, so d=2 is chosen. So only one choice here.

Hmm, perhaps there's another condition when there's a tie in minimal m's? Let's look for a case where two different d's give the same minimal m. Let me think of n where (2^n - adj[n]) can be divided by two different previous k's with same m.

Suppose for some n, the numerator (2^n - adj[n]) is divisible by two different k[d] values, say k[d1] and k[d2], both giving the same m. Then, how is d chosen? Maybe the smallest d? Or the largest?

Alternatively, maybe the choice of d[n] is the earliest possible index? Let's see if d tends to be as small as possible when possible. For example, n=9 uses d=1, which is the smallest possible. n=10 uses d=7. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the choice of d[n] is to have m[n] be as small as possible in absolute value, but with a secondary condition of choosing the latest possible d? Or earliest?

Wait, let's think differently. Since the problem states that d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n]|. If there are multiple d's that give the same minimal |m|, then perhaps the one with the largest d is chosen? Or the one with the smallest?

Alternatively, maybe the direction of adj[n]'s sign? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe there's another property, like the parity or divisibility by some number. Let me check the prime factors of k[n]. Since many have 7 as a factor, perhaps d is chosen such that k[d] divides 7? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence is following some recurrence relation. Let me see if k[n] can be expressed in terms of previous terms.

Looking at the given k's:

n | k[n]
1 | 1
2 | 3
3 |7
4 |8
5 |21
6 |49
7 |76
8 |224
9 |467
10 |?

Wait, let's see the differences. From 1 to 3: 3 = 1*3. 3 to 7: 7 = 3*2 +1? Not sure. 7 to 8: +1. 8 to 21: *2.5. 21 to49: +28 (which is 7*4). 49 to76: +27. Hmm, not obvious.

Alternatively, check if each term is related via the formula involving d[n]:

k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + adj[n]

But adj[n] = (2^n - m[n]*k[d[n}} )

Wait, original equation: m[n] = (2^n - adj[n})/k[d[n}}.

But adj[n] =k[n] -2k[n-1]

So substituting adj[n] into m[n]:

m[n] = (2^n - (k[n] -2k[n-1}))/k[d[n}].

But m[n] must be integer, so k[d[n}} divides (2^n - (k[n] -2k[n-1})).

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe there's a pattern in the m[n] values.

Looking at m's:

n | m[n]
1 | ?
Wait, the m starts from n=1? The data starts from n=1 to n=10, but m values start from n=1?

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the user provided the m[n] values? Let me check the original problem again.

Wait, in the user's question, they just mentioned the problem is to find the rule for choosing k[n], but in the data provided, they might have given the d's and m's. Let me check again.

Wait, in the problem description, the user wrote:

"You have the following data: ... the m[n] values are integers because m[n] = (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]], and d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n]|. The problem is to determine the rule that selects the correct k[n]." But perhaps the user included some data like adj, d, m for some n's. Wait, in the problem as presented here, the user included the data as part of the problem description? Let me check again.

Wait, the user's question starts with "You have the following data: ... the m[n] values are integers because m[n] = (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]], and d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n]|. The problem is to determine the rule that selects the correct k[n]."

Wait, actually, in the problem statement here, the user is quoting a problem that includes some data. However, in the current context, the user might have included some data in their question. Let me check the initial message again.

Wait, looking at the original user's message: They wrote:

"You have the following data: the m[n] values are integers because m[n] = (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]], and d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n]|. The problem is to determine the rule that selects the correct k[n]."

Wait, but actually, the user might have provided a problem statement where the data includes adj, d, m for some n, but in the current context, maybe the user is presenting the problem as a puzzle where we need to figure out the rule given that some data is known. Since in the initial prompt, the user included their own thinking process, but here, in the current question, they're asking for help.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the sequence is constructed such that each term is as small as possible? But the first few terms seem to follow a pattern but not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the d[n] is chosen not only to minimize |m[n]| but also to ensure that k[n] is as small as possible? But in that case, for n=5, choosing d=2 gives m=9 and k[5]=21. If there was another d that gives the same m but allows a smaller k, but since m determines the equation, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence is following a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if there's a pattern in the k's.

Looking at the k's:

n | k[n]
1 | 1
2 | 3
3 |7
4 |8
5 |21
6 |49
7 |76
8 |224
9 |467
10| ?

Let me see the differences between terms:

3-1=2; 7-3=4; 8-7=1; 21-8=13; 49-21=28; 76-49=27; 224-76=148; 467-224=243.

Hmm, not obvious. Let's see ratios:

3/1=3; 7/3≈2.333; 8/7≈1.14; 21/8≈2.625; 49/21≈2.333; 76/49≈1.55; 224/76≈2.947; 467/224≈2.085.

Alternatively, maybe each term is 2*previous term plus something?

Let me check:

k[2] =2*1 +1=3?

k[3]=2*3 +1=7? Yes.

k[4]=2*7 -6=8? Hmm, 2*7=14, so 14-6=8.

k[5]=2*8 +5=21? 16+5=21.

k[6]=2*21 +7=49? 42+7=49.

k[7]=2*49 -22=76? 98-22=76.

Hmm, the added terms are 1,1,-6,5,7,-22,...

Not obvious. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, looking at the terms:

k[1]=1, k[2]=3, k[3]=7, which are 2^n -1: 1=2^1-1, 3=2^2-1, 7=2^3-1. But k[4]=8, which is 2^3, so that breaks the pattern.

Wait, but 1=2^1 -1, 3=2^2 -1, 7=2^3 -1, then 15=2^4 -1, but instead we have 8. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps k[n] is following a Fibonacci-like sequence with some modification.

Looking at k[5]=21, which is 3*7; k[6]=49=7*7; k[7]=76= 21+49+6? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe related to the previous terms via the d[n] values.

Wait, since d[n] is the index chosen to minimize |m[n]|, which is (2^n - adj[n})/k[d[n}]. But adj[n}=k[n]-2k[n-1], so substituting:

m[n} = (2^n - (k[n] -2k[n-1])) / k[d[n}]

But m[n} must be integer, so k[d[n}] divides (2^n - (k[n] -2k[n-1})).

But since we are to find the rule for selecting k[n], perhaps the key is that k[n] is chosen such that it is the minimal possible value given the constraints. That is, for each n, k[n] must satisfy:

There exists some d (from 1 to n-1) such that k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + adj[n], where adj[n] is chosen such that (2^n - adj[n]) is divisible by k[d], and d is chosen to minimize |m[n}| = |(2^n - adj[n})/k[d}|.

This is recursive and might be complex. Maybe the rule is that d[n] is chosen such that m[n] is as small as possible, and then k[n] is computed as 2*k[n-1] + adj[n], where adj[n] = 2^n - m[n]*k[d[n}}.

Thus, the process is:

For each n, to compute k[n], first look back at previous terms k[1], ..., k[n-1]. For each possible d from 1 to n-1, compute m_candidate = (2^n - (k_candidate - 2*k[n-1}) ) / k[d], but this seems recursive.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal m[n] is achieved by choosing d[n] as the index where k[d] is closest to (2^n) / m, but this is vague.

Alternatively, let's try to see if the given sequence follows a particular recurrence. Let's see:

Looking at the terms:

k[1] =1

k[2]=3. Let's see 2*k[1]+1=3, so maybe +1.

k[3]=7. 2*k[2]+1=7. So again +1.

k[4]=8. 2*k[3] -6=8.

Hmm, not consistent.

Wait, k[3]=7=2^3 -1, k[4]=8=2^3, k[5]=21= 2^4 + 5, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is related to the denominators of the convergents of some continued fraction, but that might be overcomplicating.

Alternatively, considering that the problem involves choosing d[n] to minimize |m[n]|, perhaps the minimal |m[n}| is always 1, but not always possible. Let's check:

At n=2:

To compute k[2], we have to choose d from 1 (since previous terms are only k[1}=1).

m[2} = (2^2 - adj[2}) /k[d]. Since d can only be 1:

m[2}= (4 - adj[2}) /k[1}= (4 - (k[2] -2*1}) /1 = 4 - (k[2} -2).

But m must be integer, so (4 - (k[2} -2)) must be integer, which it is for any integer k[2}. But we want to minimize |m|.

So m = 6 -k[2}. To minimize |6 -k[2}|, we set k[2}=6 - m. To minimize |m|, set m as close to 0 as possible. So minimal |m| is achieved when 6 -k[2}=±1 or 0.

If m=1, then k[2}=5. If m=0, k[2}=6. If m=-1, k[2}=7.

But since we want minimal |m|, the minimal |m| is 0 or 1. Choosing m=0 gives k[2}=6, but let's see what the actual k[2} is given in the sequence: 3. Hmm, so this approach might not align with the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |m| is achieved by the closest possible, but the actual sequence given has k[2}=3, which would give m=6-3=3. Which is larger than 0 or 1. So this contradicts.

Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |m[n}| is achieved when d[n] is chosen such that k[d[n}] is as close as possible to 2^n / m[n}. Wait, but this is circular.

Alternatively, think of it as for each n, given k[1] to k[n-1], choose d in 1..n-1, and set m = (2^n - adj)/k[d], where adj =k[n] -2k[n-1]. Then k[n] = 2k[n-1} + adj. So substituting adj = (2^n - m*k[d}).

Therefore, k[n] = 2k[n-1} + (2^n - m*k[d}).

Thus, k[n} = 2k[n-1} +2^n - m*k[d}.

But m is (2^n - adj)/k[d} = (2^n - (k[n] -2k[n-1}))/k[d}).

This seems recursive and complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |m| is achieved when m is as small as possible in absolute value, so ideally m=0 or ±1.

If possible, set m=1 or -1 to minimize.

Let me see for n=2:

To get m=1, then m=1=(4 - adj)/k[d}= (4 - (k[2}-2*1))/1.

Thus 1 = (4 -k[2} +2) → 1 =6 -k[2} → k[2}=5. But given k[2}=3, so that doesn't match.

Alternatively, if m=3, then 3=(4 - adj)/1 → adj=4-3=1 → adj=1= k[2}-2 → k[2}=3. Which is the given term. So here, m=3.

But why choose m=3 instead of m=1 or 0? Because the problem states that d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n}|. So in this case, the minimal |m| would be achieved by choosing m=0 or 1, but in the given sequence it's 3. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe there's a constraint that d[n] must be less than n, and we have to choose d from previous terms. For n=2, the only previous term is k[1}=1, so d can only be 1, so m has to be (4 - adj)/1 = (4 - (k[2} -2))/1 = 6 -k[2}. To minimize |6 -k[2}|, the minimal possible is when k[2}=5 (m=1) or k[2}=6 (m=0), but the actual term is k[2}=3 (m=3). So this contradicts.

Hmm, this suggests that my understanding might be incorrect, or perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence is constructed such that each term is the smallest possible number that allows m[n] to be integer, with d[n] chosen optimally.

Wait, let's try to reconstruct the given sequence step by step:

Given k[1}=1.

For n=2:

We need to choose d=1 (only option), so m must be integer such that:

k[2}=2*k[1} + adj, and adj= k[2} -2*k[1}.

Then m=(2^2 - adj)/k[d}= (4 - (k[2}-2))/1 =6 -k[2} must be integer.

To minimize |m|, we choose k[2} as close to 6 as possible. The smallest possible k[2} would be 3 (given), but then m=3. Alternatively, if k[2}=5, m=1, which is smaller in absolute value. However, the problem might require k[n} to be as small as possible? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is following a specific pattern: starting with 1, then each term is the previous term multiplied by 2 plus 1, then minus something.

Wait:

k[1}=1,

k[2}=3 =1*2 +1,

k[3}=7=3*2 +1,

k[4}=15=7*2 +1, but given k[4}=8 instead of 15. So no.

Alternatively, after k[3}=7, then k[4}=8=7+1,

k[5}=21=8*2 +5,

k[6}=49=21*2 +7,

k[7}=76=49+27,

Hmm, not obvious.

Alternatively, looking at the differences between terms:

3-1=2,

7-3=4,

8-7=1,

21-8=13,

49-21=28,

76-49=27.

The differences are 2,4,1,13,28,27.

Not obvious.

Alternatively, the terms resemble the numerators or denominators of some fractions.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence is related to the Josephus problem, but that might be a stretch.

Alternatively, let's see if the terms are connected to the Fibonacci sequence:

Fibonacci:1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...

Given terms:1,3,7,8,21,49,76.

Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the terms are part of a different recurrence. Let's try to see:

From k[1}=1,

k[2}=3,

k[3}=7,

k[4}=8,

k[5}=21,

k[6}=49,

k[7}=76.

Looking at the relation between terms:

k[3}=2*k[2}+1,

k[4}=k[3}+1,

k[5}=3*k[3}+0,

k[6}=2*k[5}-1,

k[7}=k[5}+k[6} -4? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is built by selecting minimal terms where each term allows a certain condition related to m[n].

Alternatively, let's consider the given terms and see if there's a pattern in the d[n] choices that minimize |m[n}|.

For example, let's compute the possible m values for each n:

Starting with n=2:

Previous term k[1}=1.

To compute k[2}:

d can be only 1. So m=(4 - (k[2} -2))/1 =6 -k[2}.

We need m to be integer. To minimize |m|, set m as close to 0 as possible. The smallest |m| is when k[2}=6 (m=0) or 5 (m=1). However, given that k[2}=3, which gives m=3, this suggests that either the minimal |m| isn't prioritized, or there's another constraint.

Wait, but the problem says d is chosen to minimize |m[n}|, so the actual k[n} must be such that for the chosen d[n}, m[n} is minimal. So perhaps the given sequence is built by choosing d[n} to give the smallest possible |m[n}|, and then k[n} is determined accordingly.

Wait, let's try to reconstruct the given sequence step by step with this approach:

n=1: k[1}=1 (given).

n=2:

We need to choose d=1 (only option).

Then m[2}=(4 - adj)/k[1}= (4 - (k[2}-2))/1 =6 -k[2}.

To minimize |m[2}|, we need to choose k[2} such that |6 -k[2}| is minimized. The minimal possible is 0 (k[2}=6), but perhaps the problem requires k[n} to be as small as possible? If yes, then k[2}=5 gives m=1 which is also minimal. But given k[2}=3, which is even smaller but gives m=3, which has larger |m|. This inconsistency suggests I might be misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the problem is that adj is (k[n] -2k[n-1}), and m is (2^n - adj)/k[d}. So to minimize |m|, the adj must be as close as possible to 2^n.

Wait, let me re-arrange:

m = (2^n - adj)/k[d}.

To minimize |m|, we need (2^n - adj) to be as small as possible in absolute value, since k[d} is fixed (as it's chosen first? Or is d chosen to minimize |m|, considering all possible d's?

Ah! Perhaps I have the steps reversed.

The process should be:

For each n:

1. Look at all previous terms k[1},...,k[n-1}, which are known.

2. For each possible d from 1 to n-1:

   a. Compute m_candidate = (2^n - adj_candidate)/k[d}, where adj_candidate =k_candidate -2k[n-1}.

   b. But adj_candidate =k_candidate -2k[n-1}, so m_candidate = (2^n - (k_candidate -2k[n-1})) /k[d}.

   However, k_candidate is k[n}, which is what we need to determine.

Wait, this is circular because m_candidate depends on k_candidate (k[n}).

Alternatively, the correct approach is:

To choose d in 1..n-1 to minimize |m|, where m = (2^n - adj)/k[d} and adj =k[n] - 2k[n-1}.

But adj =k[n] -2k[n-1}, so m = (2^n - (k[n] -2k[n-1}))/k[d} = (2^n +2k[n-1} -k[n})/k[d}.

This still involves k[n}, which is being determined, so it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is rearranged to solve for k[n}:

Let me write m = (2^n - adj)/k[d}, so adj = 2^n -m*k[d}.

But adj =k[n] -2k[n-1}, so:

k[n] =2k[n-1} + adj =2k[n-1} + (2^n -m*k[d}).

Thus,

k[n} =2k[n-1} +2^n -m*k[d}.

To minimize |m|, we need to choose d and m such that this equation holds with m as small as possible in absolute value.

However, since m must be an integer (because k[n} and all previous terms are integers), we have to choose d such that (2^n +2k[n-1} -k[n}) is divisible by k[d}.

Wait, this seems too convoluted. Maybe the key is that for each n, we choose d which minimizes |(2^n +2k[n-1}) /k[d} - (k[n}/k[d})|. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's try to see the given terms and see what d[n} might be for each step:

Given the sequence up to n=7:

n | k[n]

1 | 1

2 | 3

3 |7

4 |8

5 |21

6 |49

7 |76

Let me try to see what d[n} could be for each:

For n=2:

Possible d=1.

Then m=(4 - (k[2}-2*1))/k[1}= (4 - (k[2}-2))/1 =6 -k[2}.

To minimize |m|, choose d=1 (only option), so m must be as small as possible. The given k[2}=3 gives m=3, but if we choose k[2}=5 (m=1), then that would be better. However, since the given term is 3, perhaps there's another constraint, like k[n} must be the minimal possible value that allows m to be integer with d chosen optimally.

Wait, maybe the problem requires that for each n, after choosing d to minimize |m[n}|, k[n} is determined as the minimal possible k[n} that satisfies the equation with integer m.

Alternatively, it's possible that the problem is not about constructing the sequence but about understanding the relationship between terms. However, since the user hasn't provided a specific question beyond the initial instruction, I might need to re-examine the problem.
