Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to figure out what uniquely determines the private keys k[n] from the infinitely many possible candidates given the recurrence relation. The known values and some hypotheses have been provided, but the correct property hasn't been found yet. Let's start by understanding the given data and the recurrence relation.

First, the recurrence is k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n]*k[d[n]]. Here, m[n] must be an integer, and d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n]| among valid divisors. Valid divisors are probably the indices of previous k's that divide (2^n - adj[n]), where adj[n] = k[n] - 2*k[n-1]. 

The adj values are given, so for each n, adj[n] = k[n] - 2*k[n-1]. Then m[n] is (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]]. Since m[n] has to be an integer, k[d[n]] must divide (2^n - adj[n]). But adj[n] itself is part of the equation, so there's a circular dependency here. Wait, actually, adj[n] is defined as k[n] - 2*k[n-1], so substituting into the equation for m[n], we can rearrange terms. Let me see:

Starting with the recurrence:

k[n] = 2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n]*k[d[n]]

Then, rearranged:

m[n] * k[d[n]] = 2k[n-1] + 2^n - k[n]

But adj[n] is k[n] - 2k[n-1], so substituting adj[n]:

m[n] * k[d[n]] = 2k[n-1] + 2^n - (2k[n-1] + adj[n]) 

Wait, let me do that substitution properly. Let me express k[n] as 2k[n-1] + adj[n], so:

k[n] = 2k[n-1] + adj[n]

Substituting into the recurrence equation:

2k[n-1] + adj[n] = 2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n] *k[d[n]]

Subtract 2k[n-1] from both sides:

adj[n] = 2^n - m[n]*k[d[n]]

So rearranged, m[n] = (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]]

This makes sense. So m[n] is determined once adj[n] is chosen, but adj[n] is also dependent on k[n], which is the value we need to determine. Therefore, the problem becomes selecting adj[n] such that m[n] is an integer, and d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n]| among possible divisors d[n] where k[d[n]] divides (2^n - adj[n]). 

The key here is that there are infinitely many possible adj[n] such that m[n] is an integer, but the selection of d[n] as the minimizer of |m[n]| must be such that d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n]| over all possible divisors. Wait, but how exactly are the divisors determined?

Wait, the problem states that d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n]| among valid divisors. The "valid divisors" must be indices d such that k[d] divides (2^n - adj[n]). But adj[n] is part of the equation. Hmm, this seems a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the valid divisors d are the indices of previous k's (i.e., d ≤ n-1) such that k[d] divides (2^n - adj[n]). Since adj[n] is part of the equation, this creates a recursive condition where adj[n] must be chosen such that (2^n - adj[n]) is divisible by k[d[n]], and d[n] is the index that minimizes |m[n]| = |(2^n - adj[n])/k[d]| among all possible such d.

Wait, but how do we choose adj[n]? Since adj[n] is k[n] - 2k[n-1], which is part of the definition of k[n], but k[n] is the variable we're solving for. Therefore, the problem is: given k[1] through k[n-1], choose k[n] such that there exists some m[n] and d[n] (with d[n] ≤ n-1) where m[n] = (2^n - (k[n] - 2k[n-1])) / k[d[n]] is integer, and d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n]| among all possible such d.

Therefore, for each possible candidate k[n], we can compute adj[n] = k[n] - 2k[n-1], then compute (2^n - adj[n]) which must be divisible by k[d] for some d ≤ n-1, and d is chosen as the one that gives the smallest |m[n]|.

The problem states that there are infinitely many valid k[n], but in reality, since m[n] must be integer, and d[n] must be chosen to minimize |m[n]|, perhaps the key is that among all possible k[n] that make m[n] an integer for some d, the correct k[n] is the one that corresponds to the minimal |m[n]| possible.

Wait, but the problem says that there are infinitely many k[n] that satisfy the recurrence, so perhaps the minimization is not over k[n], but over the possible m[n] values given that k[n] must be chosen such that for some d, the division works. The d[n] is chosen as the index that gives the smallest |m[n]| possible. So the correct k[n] is the one where the minimal possible |m[n]| (over all possible d) is achieved, and the corresponding m[n] must be such that the equation holds. Wait, but how does this uniquely determine k[n]? Because even if you pick the minimal |m[n]|, there might still be multiple k[n] that can achieve that minimal m[n].

Wait, perhaps the key is that d[n] is chosen such that m[n] is minimal, and the actual k[n] is determined by the recurrence equation once d[n] and m[n] are chosen. Therefore, for each n, the minimal |m[n]| corresponds to a specific d[n], and once d[n] is chosen, the equation must hold uniquely for k[n], so perhaps that gives a unique solution.

Wait, let me think again. The recurrence equation is:

k[n] = 2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n] * k[d[n]]

Given that m[n] is (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]] and adj[n] is k[n] - 2k[n-1], substituting adj[n] gives:

m[n] = (2^n - (k[n] - 2k[n-1])) / k[d[n]]

But rearranged from the recurrence equation, solving for m[n]:

m[n] = (2k[n-1] + 2^n - k[n])/k[d[n]]

Wait, that's the same as:

m[n] = (2^n - (k[n] - 2k[n-1])) / k[d[n]] which is the same as above.

But since m[n] must be integer, k[d[n]] must divide (2^n - adj[n]), where adj[n] = k[n] - 2k[n-1]. However, the equation for k[n] can be rearranged to express m[n] in terms of k[n], so the possible k[n] must satisfy that 2^n - (k[n] - 2k[n-1]) is divisible by some k[d[n]], and d[n] is chosen to make |m[n]| as small as possible.

Therefore, the problem is that for a given n, there are infinitely many k[n] such that (2^n - (k[n] - 2k[n-1])) is divisible by some k[d], but the correct k[n] is the one that when choosing d[n] to minimize |m[n]|, that particular k[n] allows for the smallest possible m[n].

Wait, but perhaps the minimal |m[n]| is achieved uniquely? That is, among all possible d choices, there is a unique d that gives the minimal |m[n]|, and that d corresponds to exactly one possible k[n]. 

Alternatively, maybe the selection of d[n] is constrained such that d[n] must be the divisor that gives the minimal |m[n]|, and once that d is chosen, the equation uniquely determines k[n] via rearranging the recurrence. Let's see:

From the recurrence equation, solving for k[n]:

k[n] = 2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n] * k[d[n]]

Therefore, once m[n] and d[n] are chosen, k[n] is uniquely determined. The problem is that there are multiple possible d[n] and m[n] that could satisfy the divisibility condition, but d[n] is chosen to minimize |m[n]|. Therefore, to get k[n], you have to pick the minimal m[n] in absolute value, which corresponds to a particular d, and then compute k[n] using that m[n] and d[n]. 

Therefore, the key is that for each n, you must choose the d which gives the smallest |m[n]|, and then compute k[n] using that m[n]. Since m[n] is (2^n - adj[n])/k[d], but adj[n] is k[n] - 2k[n-1], so substituting back into m[n], we can write m[n] in terms of k[n]:

m[n] = (2^n - (k[n] - 2k[n-1])) / k[d[n]]

But since k[n] = 2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n] * k[d[n]], this is a circular equation. Wait, perhaps the equation can be rearranged to solve for m[n]:

Let me rearrange the equation again:

m[n] = (2^n - (k[n] - 2k[n-1])) / k[d[n]]

But substituting k[n] from the recurrence equation:

k[n] = 2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n] * k[d[n]]

Therefore, substituting into the numerator:

2^n - ( (2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n] * k[d[n]] ) - 2k[n-1] ) 

Simplify the numerator:

2^n - (2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n] * k[d[n]] - 2k[n-1]) 

The 2k[n-1] terms cancel out:

2^n - (2^n - m[n] * k[d[n]]) = 2^n - 2^n + m[n] * k[d[n]] = m[n] * k[d[n]]

Therefore, m[n] = (m[n] * k[d[n]]) / k[d[n]] 

Which simplifies to m[n] = m[n]. So this is consistent but doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that once you choose d[n] as the index which minimizes |m[n]|, then m[n] must be equal to (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]], but since adj[n] is part of the equation, you can rearrange to solve for adj[n]:

adj[n] = 2^n - m[n] * k[d[n]]

But adj[n] is also k[n] - 2k[n-1], so substituting:

k[n] - 2k[n-1] = 2^n - m[n] * k[d[n]]

Then, rearranged:

k[n] = 2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n] * k[d[n]]

Which is the original equation. So this is circular.

Therefore, the real issue is that to find k[n], we must choose d[n] as the divisor (among previous indices) that gives the minimal |m[n]| where m[n] is (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]], but adj[n] is itself a function of k[n]. Therefore, this is a system where the choice of d[n] (to minimize |m[n]|) and the value of k[n] must be consistent.

Perhaps the way to solve this is that for each possible d ≤ n-1, compute m_candidate = (2^n - (k_candidate - 2k_{n-1})) / k[d], but since k_candidate is exactly 2k_{n-1} + 2^n - m_candidate * k[d], so substituting:

k_candidate = 2k_{n-1} + 2^n - m_candidate * k[d]

But m_candidate = (2^n - (k_candidate - 2k_{n-1})) / k[d] 

Substituting k_candidate from the first equation into the second:

m_candidate = (2^n - ( (2k_{n-1} + 2^n - m_candidate *k[d]) - 2k_{n-1} )) / k[d]

Simplify the numerator:

2^n - (2^n - m_candidate *k[d]) = m_candidate *k[d]

Therefore, m_candidate = (m_candidate *k[d])/k[d] = m_candidate. So this holds for any m_candidate, but the key is that m_candidate must be an integer, so k[d] must divide (2^n - adj[n]). But adj[n] is k_candidate - 2k_{n-1}, so the equation must hold.

Therefore, for each d, the possible m_candidate must satisfy m_candidate = (2^n - (k_candidate - 2k_{n-1})) /k[d], but k_candidate is defined via m_candidate. Therefore, this reduces to m_candidate must be an integer such that:

k_candidate = 2k_{n-1} + 2^n - m_candidate * k[d]

Therefore, for each candidate d, we can choose m_candidate as any integer, but then k_candidate is determined. However, the problem states that there are infinitely many k[n], so infinitely many m_candidates and d_choices. But we have to choose d[n] (the d that gives the minimal |m_candidate|).

Wait, but how do we find the minimal m_candidate? For each d, the minimal m_candidate would be the closest integer to (2^n - adj[n])/k[d], but adj[n] depends on k_candidate. This is getting confusing.

Perhaps another angle: For each possible d ≤ n-1, we can compute the possible m[n] that would be required if we choose that d. Let me see.

Suppose we fix a d (say, d is some index ≤n-1). Then, if we choose to use this d, then m[n] must be (2^n - adj[n])/k[d]. However, adj[n] is k[n] - 2k[n-1], and k[n] is defined via the recurrence. Let me see if we can express m[n] in terms of m[n]:

Wait, substituting the recurrence into the expression for m[n]:

m[n] = (2^n - (k[n] - 2k[n-1])) / k[d]

But k[n] = 2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n] * k[d]

Therefore, substituting into m[n]:

m[n] = (2^n - ( (2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n] *k[d] ) - 2k[n-1] )) /k[d]

Simplify the numerator:

2^n - (2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n]*k[d] - 2k[n-1]) 

The 2k[n-1] terms cancel out, leaving:

2^n - (2^n - m[n]*k[d]) = m[n]*k[d]

Therefore, m[n] = (m[n]*k[d])/k[d] = m[n]

This is an identity, so it doesn't help. 

Hmm. Perhaps the key is that for each possible d, m[n] can be any integer such that k[n] is defined as 2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n] *k[d]. However, the problem requires that d[n] is the index which minimizes |m[n]|. Therefore, to find the minimal |m[n]|, we need to consider all possible d from 1 to n-1, compute m[n] = (2^n - (k[n] - 2k[n-1])) /k[d], but since k[n] is dependent on m[n], this is circular. 

Alternatively, perhaps instead of thinking of m[n] as dependent on k[n], we can rearrange the equation to solve for m[n]:

From the recurrence equation:

k[n] = 2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n]*k[d[n]]

Therefore, m[n] = (2k[n-1] + 2^n - k[n])/k[d[n]]

But adj[n] = k[n] - 2k[n-1], so substituting adj[n]:

m[n] = (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]], which is consistent with before.

Alternatively, since we have to choose d[n] to minimize |m[n]|, perhaps the minimal m[n] is achieved when d[n] is chosen such that k[d[n]] is as large as possible? Or when the division (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]] is closest to zero.

Wait, but adj[n] is part of the equation, so this is tricky. Perhaps the correct approach is that for each possible d ≤n-1, we can compute m[n] as (2^n - (k[n] - 2k[n-1])) /k[d], but since k[n] is the unknown, this isn't straightforward. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that adj[n] must be such that (2^n - adj[n]) is divisible by k[d] for some d, and d is chosen to minimize |m[n]| = |(2^n - adj[n])/k[d]|. But since adj[n] = k[n] - 2k[n-1], which is part of the equation, perhaps there's a way to choose adj[n] such that (2^n - adj[n]) is divisible by some k[d], and the minimal |m[n]| is achieved. 

Wait, maybe we can think of this as follows: For each possible divisor d of (2^n - adj[n]), which must be a previous k[d], but adj[n] is part of the equation. Since we need to choose adj[n] such that (2^n - adj[n]) is divisible by at least one of the previous k[d], but with the minimal |m[n]|.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |m[n]| is achieved when (2^n - adj[n]) is as close to zero as possible, so that m[n] is close to zero. To make (2^n - adj[n]) small, we can set adj[n] ≈ 2^n, so that m[n] is approximately zero. However, adj[n] is k[n] - 2k[n-1]. Therefore, to minimize |m[n]|, perhaps the best is to have adj[n] ≈ 2^n, so that m[n] ≈0, which would imply that k[n] ≈ 2k[n-1] + 2^n - 0 = 2k[n-1] + 2^n. So that k[n] ≈ 2k[n-1] + 2^n. But then adj[n] = k[n] - 2k[n-1] ≈ 2^n, so that (2^n - adj[n]) ≈0, hence m[n]≈0. However, this is an approximation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal m[n] is achieved when d[n] is chosen such that k[d[n]] divides (2^n - adj[n]). Since adj[n] = k[n] - 2k[n-1], and k[n] = 2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n] *k[d[n]], substituting adj[n] gives:

adj[n] = (2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n] *k[d[n]]) - 2k[n-1] = 2^n - m[n]*k[d[n]]

Hence, adj[n] = 2^n - m[n]*k[d[n]]

But m[n] = (2^n - adj[n])/k[d[n]] 

So substituting adj[n]:

m[n] = (2^n - (2^n - m[n]*k[d[n}} )) /k[d[n]] 

This simplifies to m[n] = (m[n]*k[d[n]]) /k[d[n]] = m[n], which is again an identity.

This suggests that for any d, m[n] can be any integer, but with the constraint that adj[n] must be equal to 2^n - m[n]*k[d]. Therefore, to have a valid k[n], we can choose any d and m[n] such that adj[n] is defined, but then k[n] is determined via adj[n] = k[n] - 2k[n-1], so k[n] is determined once m[n] and d are chosen. 

However, the problem specifies that there are infinitely many solutions unless constrained by the requirement to choose d[n] which minimizes |m[n]|. Therefore, to find the minimal |m[n]|, we need to consider all possible d from 1 to n-1, compute the possible m[n] as (2^n - adj[n])/k[d], but since adj[n] is k[n] - 2k[n-1], and k[n] is dependent on m[n], this is still circular. 

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal m[n] is achieved when d is chosen such that k[d] is as large as possible, so that m[n] is as small as possible. For example, if we choose the largest possible k[d], then m[n] = (2^n - adj[n])/k[d] would be minimized in absolute value. 

Alternatively, perhaps another way: Let's suppose that we pick a d, then m[n] can be written as (2^n - (k[n] - 2k_{n-1}))/k[d]. But since k[n] = 2k_{n-1} + 2^n - m[n]*k[d], substituting into the expression for m[n]:

m[n] = (2^n - ( (2k_{n-1} + 2^n - m[n] *k[d]) - 2k_{n-1} )) /k[d]

Simplify numerator:

2^n - (2k_{n-1} + 2^n - m[n]*k[d] - 2k_{n-1}) = 2^n - (2^n - m[n]*k[d}) = m[n]*k[d]

Hence, m[n] = (m[n]*k[d])/k[d] = m[n], which again gives nothing.

Therefore, perhaps the key is that for any d, m[n] can be any integer, but to get the minimal |m[n]|, we need to choose d such that (2^n - adj[n]) is divisible by k[d], and |m[n]| is minimized. Since adj[n] = k[n] - 2k_{n-1} = (2k_{n-1} + 2^n - m[n] *k[d]) - 2k_{n-1} = 2^n - m[n]*k[d], so (2^n - adj[n]) = m[n]*k[d]. Therefore, m[n] must be an integer such that m[n]*k[d] = 2^n - adj[n]. But adj[n] is also equal to k[n] - 2k_{n-1}, so substituting, m[n]*k[d] = 2^n - (k[n] - 2k_{n-1}), but k[n] is 2k_{n-1} + 2^n - m[n]*k[d], so substituting that:

m[n]*k[d] = 2^n - ( (2k_{n-1} + 2^n - m[n]*k[d}) - 2k_{n-1} )

Simplify:

m[n]*k[d] = 2^n - (2^n - m[n]*k[d}) 

Which gives m[n]*k[d] = m[n]*k[d], again an identity.

This suggests that for any d and m[n], the equation holds as long as m[n] is an integer. Therefore, the only constraint is that m[n] must be an integer, and d must be chosen such that the resulting k[n] is consistent. However, since the problem mentions that there are infinitely many k[n] unless we choose the minimal m[n], we can assume that for each n, there is a sequence where d is chosen to minimize |m[n]|.

Therefore, to compute k[n], we must choose, for each n, the d in {1, ..., n-1} that minimizes |m[n]| = |(2^n - (k[n] - 2k_{n-1})) /k[d]|. But since k[n] is dependent on m[n], this is still circular. 

Perhaps we can approach this recursively. Let's compute the first few terms to see a pattern.

Starting with n=1:

Wait, the problem didn't specify initial conditions. Wait, perhaps the problem is to define a sequence where each term is defined as per the recurrence with the minimal |m[n]|. But since the problem statement is not fully given here, maybe the user is asking a different question? Wait, looking back at the user's message:
