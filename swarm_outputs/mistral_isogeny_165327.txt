 In the context of your question, secp256k1 is a specific elliptic curve used in cryptography, defined over the finite field Fp where p = 2^256 - 2^32 - 983. While it's possible for secp256k1 to have a 17-isogeny to another curve (since 17 is a prime), it's important to note that the exact nature of such an isogeny and the target curve would depend on the specific properties of secp256k1.

Currently, there isn't a definitive answer regarding the existence or identification of a 17-isogenous curve for secp256k1 because calculating isogenies between curves can be computationally intensive, and a 17-isogeny would require significant computational resources.

As for the puzzle keys being generated by walking an isogeny graph, it's theoretically possible, but again, this depends on the specific structure of the isogeny graph related to secp256k1 and the existence of paths connecting relevant curves.

The indices 9, 11, 12, 24, 48, 67 seem to follow a pattern of powers of two (doubling) and multiples of 17, which is interesting in the context of isogenies with degree 17. However, their connection to isogeny walks or m-values isn't immediately clear without more context about the puzzle or its underlying mathematics.

Regarding the connection between isogeny degree and m-values, it's worth noting that in the case of secp256k1, the degree of an isogeny between two curves is closely related to the size difference in their endomorphism rings. The endomorphism ring of secp256k1 has order 8, so the degree of an isogeny between secp256k1 and another curve would typically be a factor of the order of the other curve's endomorphism ring.

In summary, while there are some intriguing connections between your puzzle elements and the concept of isogenies in elliptic curve cryptography, more specific information about the puzzle or its context would be needed to draw definitive conclusions.
