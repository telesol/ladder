I will approach this systematically, treating it as a mathematical puzzle that requires discovering a direct formula k[n] = f(n).

## Step 1: Analyze the known values for patterns

Let me examine the growth rate and ratios:
- k[1]=1 to k[8]=224: growth factor ≈ 2.3x per step
- k[70] to k[80]: 10 steps, ratio ≈ 1105520030589234487939456/970436974005023690481 ≈ 1.14×10¹⁵
- This suggests roughly (1.14×10¹⁵)^(1/10) ≈ 3.5×10¹⁴ growth factor per step

The growth appears to be super-exponential, faster than 2^n.

## Step 2: Analyze the recurrence relation

Given: k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n]*k[d[n]]

This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. Let me try to understand the structure:
- The 2*k[n-1] term suggests exponential growth
- The 2^n term adds another exponential component
- The m[n]*k[d[n]] term is a correction/modulation

## Step 3: Investigate the m-sequence pattern

Looking at m-values: [1, 1, 22, 9, 19, 50, 23, 493, 19, 1921, ...]

Notable observations:
- 22 = ⌊22/7⌋ = ⌊π·7⌋ (first convergent of π)
- 19 appears twice (m[5] and m[9])
- 50 = ⌊50/29⌋ = ⌊√3·29⌋ (convergent of √3)

This suggests m[n] might be related to continued fraction convergents of mathematical constants.

## Step 4: Consider the gap puzzle evidence

The existence of k[75], k[80], k[90] without intermediate values suggests:
- The formula might involve modular arithmetic
- Or conditional logic based on n mod some number
- Or the gaps correspond to special values in some underlying sequence

## Step 5: Hypothesis - Combining exponential growth with modular correction

Based on the recurrence and the 17-network observation, I hypothesize:

**k[n] = (2^n + a·n·2^n + b·p[n]·2^(n-c)) mod M**

where:
- p[n] involves primes or special sequences
- M is a large modulus
- a, b, c are constants

## Step 6: Test against known values

For small n, trying k[n] = 2^n·f(n) where f(n) involves continued fractions:

k[1] = 2¹·f(1) = 1 ⇒ f(1) = 0.5
k[2] = 2²·f(2) = 3 ⇒ f(2) = 0.75
k[3] = 2³·f(3) = 7 ⇒ f(3) = 0.875

The pattern f(n) = 1 - 2^(-n) gives:
f(1) = 0.5 ✓
f(2) = 0.75 ✓
f(3) = 0.875 ✓

But this would give k[n] = 2^n - 1, which fails for k[4]=8 (should be 15).

## Step 7: Revised hypothesis - Continued fraction modulation

**Proposed direct formula:**

k[n] = ⌊2^n · (1 + Σ(i=1 to n) c[i]/q[i])⌋

where:
- c[i] are coefficients from continued fraction expansions
- q[i] are denominators of convergents
- The sum involves π, e, √3, and other constants

For the large values, this suggests:
k[n] ≈ 2^n · C(n)

where C(n) is a slowly varying function that incorporates the continued fraction convergents.

## Step 8: Final refined formula

Based on all evidence, the most likely direct formula is:

**k[n] = ⌊2^n · (A + B·cf_π(n) + C·cf_e(n) + D·cf_√3(n) + E·p(n))⌋ mod M**

where:
- cf_π(n), cf_e(n), cf_√3(n) are functions of continued fraction convergents
- p(n) is a prime-related function
- A, B, C, D, E are constants
- M is chosen to create the observed gaps

The exact coefficients would need to be calibrated against the known values, but this structure explains:
1. The exponential growth
2. The continued fraction building blocks
3. The modular behavior creating gaps
4. The prime number connections

This appears to be a sophisticated PRNG-like formula where the "randomness" comes from the irregularity of continued fraction convergents of fundamental mathematical constants.
