To construct \( k[71] \) using the given insights, we need to carefully analyze the recurrence relation and use the constraints provided by the known values and patterns.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

#### 1. Recurrence Relation Analysis:
Given:
\[ k[n] = 2k[n-1] + 2^n - m[n] \cdot k[d[n]] \]

We have:
\[ k[75] = 2k[74] + 2^{75} - m[75] \cdot k[d[75]] \]
\[ k[74] = 2k[73] + 2^{74} - m[74] \cdot k[d[74]] \]
\[ k[73] = 2k[72] + 2^{73} - m[73] \cdot k[d[73]] \]
\[ k[72] = 2k[71] + 2^{72} - m[72] \cdot k[d[72]] \]
\[ k[71] = 2k[70] + 2^{71} - m[71] \cdot k[d[71]] \]

#### 2. Working Backwards from \( k[75] \):
We know:
- \( k[70] = 0x349b84b6431a6c4ef1 \)
- \( k[75] \) is known

Let's denote the unknowns:
\[ m[71], m[72], m[73], m[74], m[75] \]
\[ d[71], d[72], d[73], d[74], d[75] \]

#### 3. Constraining the Intermediate \( k[n] \):
Using the D-Minimization Rule:
- Most commonly, \( d[n] = 1 \) or \( 2 \).

The Unified Formula:
\[ m[n] = \frac{2^n - adj[n]}{k[d[n]]} \]
\[ adj[n] = k[n] - 2k[n-1] \]

#### 4. Oscillation of \( c[n] \):
\[ c[n] = \frac{k[n]}{2^n} \]
- Alternates low/high.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate \( adj[75] \) and \( m[75] \):**
   \[
   adj[75] = k[75] - 2k[74]
   \]
   \[
   m[75] = \frac{2^{75} - adj[75]}{k[d[75]]}
   \]

2. **Determine \( d[75] \):**
   - Given that \( d[n] \) is most commonly 1 or 2, we can try both and see which fits.

3. **Backward Calculation:**
   Once \( m[75] \) and \( d[75] \) are known:
   \[
   k[74] = \frac{k[75] - 2^{75} + m[75] \cdot k[d[75]]}{2}
   \]

4. **Repeat for \( k[73], k[72], k[71] \):**
   - Calculate \( adj[n] \) and \( m[n] \) iteratively.
   - Use the recurrence relation to find each intermediate \( k \).

### Practical Considerations:

- **Number of Combinations:**
  Each step has two choices for \( d[n] \) (usually 1 or 2), so there are \( 2^5 = 32 \) combinations in total.

- **Oscillation Constraint:**
  Ensure that the calculated \( k[n] \) values satisfy the oscillation pattern of \( c[n] \).

### Example Calculation:

Let's assume \( d[75] = 1 \):
\[
adj[75] = k[75] - 2k[74]
\]
\[
m[75] = \frac{2^{75} - adj[75]}{k[1]}
\]

Calculate \( k[74] \):
\[
k[74] = \frac{k[75] - 2^{75} + m[75] \cdot k[1]}{2}
\]

Repeat for \( d[74], d[73], d[72], d[71] \).

By iterating through the possible values of \( d[n] \) and ensuring that the calculated \( k[n] \) values fit the oscillation pattern, we can identify the correct sequence.

### Conclusion:

The process involves working backwards from \( k[75] \) to \( k[70] \), using the recurrence relation and constraints provided. By iterating through the possible combinations of \( d[n] \) and ensuring that the calculated values fit the oscillation pattern, we can determine \( k[71] \).
