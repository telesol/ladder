### Statistical Hypothesis Testing for WAVE 21 Breakthroughs

#### H1: **Maximization of Entropy Measure**

* **Mathematical Formulation**: Let \(E(k[n])\) represent an entropy measure (e.g., Shannon entropy) of the distribution of valid \(k[n]\) candidates. The hypothesis suggests that the actual \(k[n]\) is chosen such that \(E(k[n]) \geq E(k'[n])\) for all other valid \(k'[n]\).
* **Testing Approach**:
	1. Calculate the entropy of the distribution of valid \(k[n]\) for each \(n\), assuming a discrete uniform distribution over the set of valid candidates.
	2. Compare the observed \(k[n]\)'s entropy with the maximum, minimum, and average entropies of all possible distributions (given by permutations of valid \(k[n]\) values).
	3. **Statistical Test**: Use a permutation test to determine if the observed entropy is significantly higher than expected by chance.
* **Supporting/Refuting Data**:
	+ **Supports**: If the observed \(k[n]\) consistently yields entropies significantly higher than the null distribution's mean.
	+ **Refutes**: Failure to reject the null hypothesis or observing that actual \(k[n]\) entropies are not consistently among the highest.

#### H2: **Median of Valid Candidates**

* **Mathematical Formulation**: The actual \(k[n]\) is the median value when all valid candidates for \(k[n]\) are ordered.
* **Testing Approach**:
	1. For each \(n\), list all valid \(k[n]\) in ascending order and identify the median(s).
	2. Compare the actual \(k[n]\) with the identified median(s).
	3. **Statistical Test**: Since this is more of a direct comparison, use a simple proportion test to see if the actual \(k[n]\) matches the median significantly more often than expected by chance (50% for continuous distributions, but since we're dealing with discrete values, it might slightly vary).
* **Supporting/Refuting Data**:
	+ **Supports**: If the proportion of matches is significantly higher than 0.5.
	+ **Refutes**: If the proportion is not significantly different from 0.5 or lower.

#### H3: **Minimization of Deviation from Target Ratio**

* **Mathematical Formulation**: Let \(r = k[n]/k[n-1]\) and \(T\) be a target ratio. The hypothesis posits that \(k[n]\) minimizes \(|r - T|\).
* **Testing Approach**:
	1. Estimate \(T\) from the data (e.g., mean or median of observed ratios for various \(n\)).
	2. For each \(n\), calculate the absolute deviation of \(r\) from \(T\) for all valid \(k[n]\) candidates.
	3. **Statistical Test**: Use a one-sample t-test to see if the mean deviation for actual \(k[n]\) values is significantly lower than for non-selected candidates.
* **Supporting/Refuting Data**:
	+ **Supports**: If the mean deviation for actual \(k[n]\) is significantly lower.
	+ **Refutes**: Failure to reject the null hypothesis or observing no significant difference.

#### H4: **Relation to Previous Key's Position (\(c[n-1]\))**

* **Mathematical Formulation**: There exists a functional relationship between \(k[n]\) and \(c[n-1] = k[n-1]/2^{n-1}\), e.g., \(k[n] = f(c[n-1])\).
* **Testing Approach**:
	1. Explore visualizations (e.g., scatter plots) of \(k[n]\) vs. \(c[n-1]\) for patterns.
	2. Fit various regression models to the data and evaluate their goodness of fit.
	3. **Statistical Test**: Use cross-validation to assess the predictive power of the model, comparing it against a baseline (e.g., random prediction).
* **Supporting/Refuting Data**:
	+ **Supports**: Strong, significant correlations or high predictive accuracy.
	+ **Refutes**: Lack of correlation or poor predictive performance.

### Additional Analyses

#### Autocorrelation of adj[n] Sequence

* **Method**: Calculate the autocorrelation function (ACF) for the \(adj[n]\) sequence to identify any patterns or periodicity.
* **Insight**: Significant autocorrelation at specific lags might suggest underlying mechanisms influencing the sequence.

#### Distribution of k[n]/k[n-1] Ratios

* **Method**: Plot a histogram or density plot of these ratios and assess their distribution (e.g., normality tests).
* **Insight**: Understanding this distribution can provide clues about the growth rate of \(k[n]\) and potential support for H3.

#### Clustering in c[n] Values

* **Method**: Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering) to the sequence of \(c[n]\) values.
* **Insight**: Identifying clusters could imply that certain ranges of positions are more favorable or have distinct characteristics.
