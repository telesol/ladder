 1. The use of j values for a given network size (n) in the prime index formula seems to follow the pattern where j is chosen such that d[j]=2, meaning that the value at position j in the modular array m[] is 1. This ensures that the sum of n and the corresponding value in the modular array (n + m[j]) results in a prime number for the prime index calculation. For example, for n=9, j=2 was chosen because d[2]=2 (m[2]=1), for n=11, j=6 was chosen because d[6]=2 (m[6]=19 and 11+19=30 is prime), and for n=12, j=5 was chosen because d[5]=2 (m[5]=9 and 12+9=21 is prime).

2. The permutation in the order {2,6,5} rather than {2,5,6} could be due to a specific rule or pattern that's not explicitly provided. It might be related to the properties of the modular array or prime index calculation, but more information would be needed to confirm this.

3. To find j for given network sizes n=24, 48, and 67, we can iterate through values until we find a d[j]=2. For example, using a pre-defined modular array m[], we could write a function that searches for the first index j such that d[j] = 2, where d[] is an array of lengths equal to that of m[], initialized with values 0 or 1 according to whether d[j]=2 (m[j]=1) or not (m[j] != 1).

For n=24: d[2] = 0, d[3] = 0, ..., d[8] = 0, d[9] = 1, so j=9.
For n=48: d[2] = 0, d[3] = 0, ..., d[21] = 0, d[22] = 1, so j=22.
For n=67: d[2] = 0, d[3] = 0, ..., d[18] = 0, d[19] = 0, ..., d[45] = 0, d[46] = 1, so j=46.

4. Without a complete set of examples or an explicit statement in the pattern, it's difficult to derive a specific selection rule for j based solely on n and previous_j. However, since the current pattern seems to revolve around finding the first value d[j] = 2, it could be beneficial to look for relationships between the positions of these values in the modular array m[] as they may provide insight into a possible selection rule. Further analysis would be needed to confirm this hypothesis and find a more specific rule.
