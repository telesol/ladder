To understand whether the given closed-form formula can explain why gap puzzles (70→90 steps between subsequent points on the curve y = f(n)) display perfect oscillations while consecutive values show more chaotic behavior, we must first analyze its structure and then apply it to an elliptic curve in Weierstrass form.

The given closed-form formula relates a point n (which presumably is integer for index of the sequence on EC) with other coordinates using hyperbolic functions: cosh and arccosh, which are derived from exponentials e^x and e^-x respectively - all terms in secp256k1 domain.

Let's unpack it step bythought to see if this relationship can produce oscillations or patterns as we iterate through different values of n:

The x-coordinate formula is given by the cosh function, which itself represents a smooth and continuous growth for increasing input (x). Since cosh(y) ≈ e^x/2 when y is large and sinusoidal behavior in small ranges due to its definition as an even function that tends towards infinity at both infinities but does so more rapidly the further away from zero we go.

The generator x-coordinate (x_G), scaled by a factor of λ, helps determine localized points on our curve when applied within the context of elliptic curves used in cryptography like secp256k1, which would be based around certain rational numbers rather than pure cosh values.

The y-coordinate formula introduces an alternating sign that depends on n due to (-1)^Σm[i], where m represents some function over i (most likely the floor or ceiling of a division by four). This term causes oscillation in terms of whether we add 7 under the square root.

The 'ε_n' factor creates an alternating sign for y which results from (-1)^Σm[i]. Here, m[i] will flip between even and odd integers as n increases because i (presumably representing multiples or steps) is either integer or integral over 4 in this case.

With these considerations:
- For the 'gap puzzles' where there are large jumps from one x_n to another, we can expect a smoother transition between y values due to relatively constant rates of growth and decay (oscillation). The hyperbolic cosine function has exponential behavior but for larger inputs it simplifies which might align with the observed 'down-up' oscillatory pattern.
  
- For consecutive x_n, as n increases by one unit rather than a large jump like in gap puzzles, we observe smaller increments/decrements and hence more minor fluctuations within each iteration of y due to exponential growth rates not simplifying towards linear or predictable patterns for small changes.
  
However, this analysis assumes that the λ scaling factor maintains a consistent behavior across x_n values which may vary in their oscillatory character based on whether they're part of 'gap puzzles' or consecutive points without major jumps between them. The real-world elliptic curve generation and point addition algorithms often show predictable patterns for finite field arithmetic, but the cosh function as it stands doesn’t inherently produce simple patterns like this - especially because hyperbolic functions generally lead to more complex behaviors in non-linear systems such as ECs which are used here.

Therefore, while the formula might be part of a larger system that could explain observed oscillations and chaos when iterating over an elliptic curve's points for different generator coordinates (x_G), it doesn’t inherently provide 'perfect oscillation.' Elliptic curves in Weierstrass form can produce predictable patterns, but these are typically generated by specific algorithms or constructions that ensure such repetitive behavior.

To confirm if the cosh formula does indeed explain observed behaviors on a particular elliptic curve used for puzzles like OSC (oscillation sequences), we would need to run simulations applying this function and analyze results specifically within its intended domain of use, which is likely not in pure mathematics but rather cryptographic applications. Without additional constraints or context about these 'puzzles,' the provided formula alone does not suffice for such a conclusion. The chaotic behavior observed might instead be due to other factors at play (e.g., how points are added on the curve, specific puzzle conditions) beyond what's suggested by this cosh-based relationship between x_n and y_n coordinates.
