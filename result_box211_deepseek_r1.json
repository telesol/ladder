So I need to figure out the rule that generates these numbers. The task suggests considering four hypotheses:\n\n1. Recurrence: m[n] = f(m[n-1], m[n-2], m[n-3], n)\n2. Mathematical constants: m[n] = convergent_numerator(constant, index)\n3. Factorization pattern: m[n] = product of small primes with n-dependent exponents\n4. Bit manipulation: m[n] = bitwise_op(m[n-1], 2^n, ...)\n\nAdditionally, we have some equations:\n\nk[71] = 4,302,057,189,444,869,987,810 - m[71]*k[d[71]]\n\nVerified facts:\n1. d[n] is chosen to minimize m[n]\n2. adj[n] = 2^n - m[n]*k[d[n]]\n3. k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + adj[n]\n\nThe goal is to find the mathematical rule for m[n].\n\nFirst, let's see if I can figure out what d[n], adj[n], and k[n] represent.\n\nFrom fact 2: adj[n] = 2^n - m[n]*k[d[n]]\n\nSo for each n, we're computing something called \"adjustment,\" which is equal to 2^n minus the product of m[n] and some k value indexed by d[n].\n\nThen, from fact 3: k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + adj[n]\n\nSo k[n] is twice the previous k plus this adjustment.\n\nNow, equation given:\n\nk[71] = 4,302,057,189,444,869,987,810 - m[71]*k[d[71]]\n\nHmm. So to compute k[71], it's equal to a very large constant minus m[71] times some previous k term, indexed by d[71].\n\nGiven that, and since from fact 1: d[n] is chosen to minimize m[n]. So for each n, we choose the index d such that when computing adj[n], it minimizes m[n]. But wait, how?\n\nWait, perhaps this is a recursive process? Like, at each step n, you compute k[n] based on previous k's and adjustments.\n\nGiven that k[n] depends on 2*k[n-1] + adj[n], which in turn depends on m[n].\n\nBut without knowing more about d[n], it's tricky. However, the question is to find the rule for m[n]. So perhaps we can figure out how m[n] relates to previous terms.\n\nLooking at the given values:\n\nn: 2-70\n\nLooking at n=2:1; n=3:1; n=4:22; n=5:9; n=6:19; n=7:50; etc. The numbers vary quite a bit, sometimes increasing, sometimes decreasing.\n\nFirst thought: Maybe m[n] relates to binary representations or something? Since we have 2^n in the equations.\n\nBut let's see another approach. Let's compute some ratios or differences:\n\nCompute m[4]/m[3]:22/1=22\n\nm[5]/m[4]=9/22≈0.409\n\nm[6]/m[5]=19/9≈2.111\n\nNot helpful.\n\nDifferences:\n\nm[4]-m[3}=21; m[5}-m[4}=-13; m[6}-m[5}=10; m[7}-m[6}=31; etc. Also not obvious.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the numbers are related to some combinatorial sequences or number-theoretic functions.\n\nLooking at the numbers, many seem to be multiples of primes? Let's check:\n\nm[2]=1\n\nm[3]=1\n\nm[4]=22=2×11\n\nm[5}=9=3²\n\nm[6}=19 (prime)\n\nm[7}=50=2×5²\n\nm[8}=23 (prime)\n\nm[9}=493: let's factor this. 493 divided by 17 is 29; yes, 17×29.\n\nm[10}=19 (prime). Wait, m[6} and m[10} are both 19? Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe not prime factors but something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers relate to powers of 2 minus something. For example:\n\nLooking at n=4:22 vs 16 (2^4). Not close.\n\nn=5:9 vs 32. Not really.\n\nWait, 2^n - m[n]:\n\nn=2:4-1=3\n\nn=3:8-1=7\n\nn=4:16-22=-6? Wait negative, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe m[n] is somehow a numerator of a continued fraction convergent or something related to constants like pi or e? Not sure. Maybe check if the numbers are in OEIS (Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences), but since I can't access it right now, have to think differently.\n\nAnother angle: Since adj[n]=2^n - m[n]k[d[n]], and k[n] is defined using previous k's and adjustments, perhaps this relates to a linear recurrence or some form of binary expansion. Also, the term 2*k[n-1] suggests maybe something binary or related to bits.\n\nLooking at the given data:\n\nFrom n=2 up, let me list m[n], 2^n:\n\nn | m[n] | 2^n\n---|-----|----\n2 | 1 |4\n3 |1 |8\n4 |22 |16\n5 |9 |32\n6 |19 |64\n7 |50 |128\n8 |23 |256\n9 |493 |512\n10 |19 |1024\n\nSo, for n=2: m[n]=1, which is 1/4 of 2^2.\n\nn=3: same as n=2.\n\nAt n=4:22 vs 16; 22\u003e16.\n\nn=5:9 vs32; less than half.\n\nHmm. Maybe not a direct proportion.\n\nLooking at the values, m[4]=22 is 2×11, which are primes. But then again, 11 isn't directly linked to n=4.\n\nAlternatively, think about binary representations:\n\nm[n] in binary:\n\nn | m[n] | binary\n---|-----|-----\n2 |1 |1\n3 |1 |1\n4 |22 |10110\n5 |9 |1001\n6 |19 |10011\n7 |50 |110010\n8 |23 |10111\n9 |493 |111101001\n10|19 |10011\n\nNot sure if there's a pattern here. Perhaps some bitwise operations, but it's unclear.\n\nLet me check the recurrence hypothesis: m[n] = f(m[n-1], m[n-2}, ...)\n\nLooking at m[4}=22; could 22 relate to previous terms?\n\nm[3}=1 and m[2}=1. 1 +1=2≠22.\n\nSimilarly, m[5}=9 from m[4}=22 and m[3}=1: 22/ something? 22 -13=9, but where would 13 come from?\n\nAlternatively, products: 1*1=1; not 22. Maybe exponentials? Not obvious.\n\nPerhaps the factorization pattern: product of small primes with exponents depending on n.\n\nLooking at m[4}=22=2×11; m[5}=9=3²; m[6}=19 (prime); m[7}=50=2×5²; m[8}=23; m[9}=17×29. Hmm, it's a mix of small and large primes.\n\nSo, not sure about that.\n\nAnother angle: the equation k[n] = 2k[n-1} + adj[n], where adj[n}=2^n -m[n]*k[d[n}].\n\nPerhaps if we can figure out what d[n] is. The fact that d[n} is chosen to minimize m[n]. So for each n, when computing adj[n}, which depends on k[d[n}], we pick the index d such that m[n} is minimized. Wait, but how? Is this a minimization over possible previous terms?\n\nWait, maybe in some way it's similar to a greedy algorithm where at each step you choose the best possible option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps d[n] refers to the number of digits or something else related to n.\n\nBut without knowing more about k and adj, hard to tell. Maybe we can try computing k for the initial terms?\n\nWait, let me see: starting from n=2:\n\nWe have m[2}=1\n\nAssuming k starts somewhere? Let's assume k[2} is some value. But wait, in equation 3: k[n] = 2k[n-1} + adj[n}\n\nSo we need initial conditions.\n\nBut for n=2, if n starts at 2, what was k[1}? Maybe k[1}=0?\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nFor n=2: adj[2}=2^2 - m[2}*k[d[2}]\n\nSimilarly, to compute k[2}, we need adj[2}.\n\nBut if d[2} is chosen such that it minimizes m[2}. Since m[n} is given as 1 for n=2. So maybe d[2}= something minimal? Maybe d[2}=1?\n\nIf so, then adj[2}=4 -1*k[d[2}] =4 -k[1}\n\nBut if k[1}=0 (as initial), then adj[2}=4-0=4.\n\nThen k[2}=2*k[1} + adj[2}=0+4=4.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3: m[3}=1\n\nadj[3}=8 -1*k[d[3}]\n\nWe need to choose d[3} to minimize m[3}. But since m[3} is 1 regardless of k. So maybe similar logic: set d[3}=2.\n\nThen adj[3}=8 -k[2}=8-4=4\n\nThus, k[3}=2*4 +4=12\n\nWait, so k[n}=2*k[n-1}+adj[n}\n\nFor n=4:\n\nm[4}=22\n\nadj[4}=16 -22*k[d[4}}\n\nWe have to choose d[4} to minimize m[4}. But since m[4} is 22 regardless. So perhaps d[4}=3.\n\nThen adj[4}=16 -22*k[3}=16-22*12=16-264=-248\n\nThus, k[4}=2*k[3} + adj[4}=24 + (-248)=-224\n\nWait, so k[4}=-224?\n\nThat seems possible. Let's proceed.\n\nn=5: m[5}=9\n\nadj[5}=32 -9*k[d[5}}\n\nChoose d[5} to minimize m[5}. Maybe d[5}=4.\n\nThen adj[5}=32 -9*(-224)=32 + 2016=2048\n\nThus, k[5}=2*(-224)+2048= -448 +2048=1600\n\nn=6: m[6]=19\n\nadj[6}=64 -19*k[d[6}}\n\nd[6} chosen to minimize m[6}. Let's try d=5.\n\nThen adj=64 -19*1600=64 - 30400= -30336\n\nk[6}=2*1600 + (-30336)=3200 -30336= -27136\n\nn=7: m[7]=50\n\nadj[7}=128 -50*k[d[7}}\n\nd[7}=6.\n\nadj=128 -50*(-27136)=128 +1,356,800=1,356,928\n\nk[7}=2*(-27136) +1,356,928= -54,272 +1,356,928≈1,302,656\n\nn=8: m[8]=23\n\nadj[8}=256 -23*k[d[8}}\n\nd[8}=7.\n\nadj=256 -23*1,302,656≈256 -29,961,088≈-29,960,832\n\nk[8}=2*(1,302,656)+ (-29,960,832)=2,605,312 -29,960,832≈-27,355,520\n\nThis seems to be diverging quickly. Not sure if this is helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe d[n} refers to something else, like the number of bits in m[n}? But that also might not make sense.\n\nWait another idea: perhaps d[n} is the previous term's index? Like for n=4, d[4}=3; n=5,d=4 etc. So it's just using prior k.\n\nBut as above, this causes huge growth or decay in k[n}, which seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe d[n} is a different function of n, like floor(n/2) or something.\n\nWait, without knowing how d[n} is determined, hard to proceed.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the sequence relates to binary carry sequences or some similar concept. Alternatively, maybe it's linked to partitions or other number theory functions.\n\nAlternatively, think about m[n] as being approximately 2^{n}/something.\n\nCompute 2^n/m[n]:\n\nn=2:4/1=4\n\nn=3:8/1=8\n\nn=4:16/22≈0.727\n\nn=5:32/9≈3.555\n\nn=6:64/19≈3.368\n\nn=7:128/50≈2.56\n\nn=8:256/23≈11.13\n\nn=9:512/493≈1.038\n\nn=10:1024/19≈53.894\n\nNot a clear pattern.\n\nWait, maybe m[n} is the number of ones in binary representations or something? For n=2, 2^2=100, which has one '1'; but m[2}=1. Hmm. Similarly, for n=3:8=1000; one '1' vs m[3}=1.\n\nFor n=4:16=10000; one '1', but m[4}=22. Doesn't fit.\n\nn=5:32=100000; m[n}=9. Not matching.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe related to factors or divisors. For example, number of divisors of 2^n.\n\nWait, 2^2 has 3 divisors (1,2,4); but m[2}=1.\n\nNope.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of divisors function σ(2^{n})=2^{n+1}-1.\n\nFor n=2: σ(4)=1+2+4=7≠1\n\nNot matching.\n\nAnother idea: The number of subsets or something. Doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe m[n} relates to the number of binary strings of length n with certain properties? For example, without two consecutive ones.\n\nBut for n=2, that would be 3 (00,01,10); but m[2}=1.\n\nNope.\n\nAlternatively, Fibonacci numbers: F(4)=3; not 22. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, 22 is the 10th prime. Maybe indexing into primes? Let's see:\n\nList of primes:2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,...\n\nm[4}=22 isn't a prime, but m[6}=19 which is the 8th prime.\n\nWait n=4 corresponds to 22 which isn't a prime. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's related to factorial? But 4! =24 vs m[4}=22 close but no.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps m[n} relates to some base conversion or encoding.\n\nLooking at the given equation:\n\nadj[n}=2^n -m[n}*k[d[n}}\n\nAnd k[n}=2*k[n-1} + adj[n}\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nk[n}=2*k[n-1} + (2^n - m[n}*k[d[n}} )\n\nThus,\n\nk[n} = 2*k[n-1} + 2^n -m[n}*k[d[n}}\n\nRearranged:\n\nk[n} + m[n}*k[d[n}} = 2*k[n-1} + 2^n\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if d[n}=n-1, then we have:\n\nk[n} + m[n]*k[n-1} =2*k[n-1}+2^n\n\nThen,\n\nk[n} = (2 -m[n})*k[n-1} +2^n\n\nBut let's test with prior numbers.\n\nFrom n=2: k[2}=4 as above. For n=3:\n\nAssume d[3}=2, then,\n\nk[3}=(2 - m[3}) *k[2}+8=(2 -1)*4 +8=4 +8=12, which matches our previous result.\n\nn=4: k[4}=(2 -22)*12 +16=(-20)*12 +16=-240 +16=-224. Also matches.\n\nn=5: (2-9)*(-224) +32=(-7)*(-224)+32≈1568+32=1600. Correct.\n\nSo, perhaps d[n}=n-1 for all n≥2? Then the formula would be k[n}=(2 -m[n}) *k[n-1} +2^n\n\nTherefore, if that's true, then this recurrence allows us to compute k[n}, given m[n} and previous k.\n\nBut we need to confirm whether d[n}=n-1 is indeed chosen as per \"minimizing m[n}\".\n\nWait, the problem states: \"d[n] is chosen such that m[n} is minimized\".\n\nSo for each n, when computing adj[n}=2^n -m[n}*k[d[n}}, choose d[n} (presumably from previous indices) to minimize m[n}. But since m[n} is given, perhaps d[n} is being chosen so that 2^n -k[d[n}}*m[n} is maximized or something else? Wait, no. Because adj[n}=2^n -m[n}*k[d[n}}, and then k[n} depends on adj[n}.\n\nBut the instruction says: \"Find m[n}\" using d[n} chosen to minimize it. So perhaps for each n, you can choose any previous index j \u003cn as d[n}, compute potential adj[n}=2^n -m[j}*k[j}, but wait no.\n\nWait, original problem statement:\n\n\"Find m such that adj = 2^k - m * k[d], and k is defined as 2*k_prev + adj. The task is to find m given that d is chosen to minimize m.\"\n\nSo perhaps more accurately: For each position n (starting from some base), when calculating the adjustment adj[n}, you can choose any previous index j \u003cn, compute adj_j = 2^n -m_j *k[j], and then select the j which minimizes the resulting m[n}.\n\nBut wait, m is what we're trying to find. So maybe it's a bit more involved.\n\nWait, perhaps for each n, m[n} is computed as (2^n - adj[n}) /k[d[n}}\n\nBecause from adj[n}=2^n -m[n}*k[d[n}}, so m[n}=(2^n -adj[n}})/k[d[n}}\n\nBut then k[n}=2*k[n-1} + adj[n}\n\nSo, this seems a bit recursive. Maybe the idea is that for each n, to compute m[n}, we can choose d[n} such that (2^n - adj[n}) /k[d[n}} is minimized.\n\nWhich would be equivalent to choosing d[n} such that k[d[n}} is maximized, since 2^n and adj[n} are constants for a given n.\n\nBut this seems abstract. Perhaps m[n} is being defined via these relations with previous terms, where d[n} is chosen optimally (to minimize m[n}).\n\nSo, perhaps the process is:\n\n1. Start with initial k values.\n\n2. For each n, compute adj[n}=2^n -m[n}*k[d[n}}\n\n3. But since we need to find m[n}, rearrange: m[n}=(2^n -adj[n})/k[d[n}}\n\nBut also, from the definition of k[n}:k[n}=2*k[n-1} + adj[n}\n\nSo,\n\nFrom 2., adj[n}=2^n -m[n}*k[d[n}}.\n\nFrom 3., k[n}=2*k[n-1} + (2^n -m[n}*k[d[n}}\n\nThus, putting together:\n\nWe can think of for each n, we have to choose d[n} such that m[n}=(2^n - (k[n}-2*k[n-1})) /k[d[n}} is minimized.\n\nBut since k[n}=2*k[n-1} + adj[n}, so adj[n}=k[n} -2*k[n-1}\n\nTherefore, from above,\n\nm[n}=(2^n - (k[n}-2*k[n-1}} )/k[d[n}}\n\nSo,\n\nm[n}=(2^n -k[n} + 2*k[n-1}) /k[d[n}}\n\nBut since k[n} is also dependent on d[n}, which we can choose, this becomes tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps treating m[n} as the minimal possible value for (2^n - adj)/k[j}, where j \u003cn.\n\nSo,\n\nFor each n, to compute m[n}, look at all previous k[j}, compute (2^n - adj)/k[j}, but wait, adj itself is related to k[n}.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible m such that for some d \u003cn, m = (2^n - (k[n}-2*k[d])) /k[d]\n\nBut this seems recursive because k[n} depends on m.\n\nWait, perhaps starting from base cases and building up.\n\nAssume n=1: If we have initial conditions. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe assume some initial value for k[0} or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process is such that each step n uses d[n}=n-1 as above, leading to a specific recurrence.\n\nBut since it's unclear, perhaps given the earlier observation when assuming d[n}=n-1, and computing m[n}, we saw the numbers become large. So maybe it's correct?\n\nWait, in our initial calculation:\n\nWith d[n}=n-1,\n\nk[2} =4\n\nm[3}=(8 - adj[3}) /k[2}\n\nBut adj[3}=k[3}-2*k[2}\n\nSo,\n\nadj[3}=12 - 8=4\n\nThus, m[3}=(8 -4)/4=1. Which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, k[4}=-224.\n\nCompute adj[4}=k[4}-2*k[3}=-224 -24=-248\n\nThen, m[4}=(16 - (-248))/k[d[4}}. Wait, d[4}=3? So k[d[4}}=12.\n\nSo,\n\nm[4}=(16 - (-248))/12=(264)/12=22, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=5:\n\nadj[5}=1600 -2*(-224)=1600 +448=2048\n\nThen m[5}=(32 -2048)/k[d[5}}\n\nAssuming d[5}=4, so k[d[5}}=-224\n\nSo,\n\nm[5}=(32 -2048)/(-224)=( -2016 ) / (-224)=9, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=6:\n\nadj[6}=k[6}-2*k[5}\n\nBut wait, need to compute step by step. From earlier, k[6}= ?\n\nWait, let's recast it properly.\n\nGiven that for each n,\n\nm[n}=(2^n - adj[n}) /k[d[n}}\n\nand\n\nadj[n}=k[n}-2*k[n-1}\n\nThus,\n\nm[n}=(2^n - (k[n}-2*k[n-1})) /k[d[n}}\n\nSo, m[n}=(2^n -k[n} + 2*k[n-1}) /k[d[n}}\n\nBut from the recurrence of k:\n\nk[n}=2*k[n-1} + adj[n}\n\nBut adj[n}=2^n -m[n}*k[d[n}}\n\nTherefore,\n\nk[n}=2*k[n-1} + (2^n -m[n}*k[d[n}} )\n\nThus, we have two equations:\n\n1. m[n}=(2^n -k[n} + 2*k[n-1}) /k[d[n}}\n\n2. k[n}=2*k[n-1} +2^n -m[n}*k[d[n}}\n\nThis seems like a system of equations for each n, with variables m[n},k[n}, and the choice of d[n}.
