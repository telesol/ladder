# TASK: Test Digit Sum Hypothesis

## Discovery
We found that m[5] = 9 could be digit_sum(333) where 333 is π's third convergent numerator.

## Your Task
Test if OTHER m values follow digit sum patterns from mathematical constants.

## Data
π convergents: 3/1, 22/7, 333/106, 355/113, 103993/33102
e convergents: 2/1, 3/1, 8/3, 11/4, 19/7, 87/32, 106/39

m sequence (n=2 to 20):
3, 7, 22, 9, 19, 50, 23, 493, 19, 1921, 1241, 8342, 2034, 26989, 8470, 138269, 255121, 564091, 900329

## Questions to Explore
1. Does m[5]=9 = digit_sum(333) = 3+3+3 = 9? YES!
2. Does m[6]=19 relate to digit_sum of any convergent?
3. What about m[8]=493? Could it be digit manipulation of 355 or 113?
4. Is there a pattern: m[n] = f(convergent[n-2]) ?

## Think creatively
- Try digit sums
- Try digit products
- Try reversing digits
- Try combining numerator and denominator
- Try XOR or other bit operations

Propose a construction rule that explains multiple m values!
