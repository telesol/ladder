## CRITICAL DISCOVERIES - READ THIS

### 1. Origin of 17 (The Key!)
**17 = √2 convergent numerator at index 3**

√2 convergents: 1/1, 3/2, 7/5, **17/12**, 41/29, 99/70...

This explains why 17 appears so often in m-values - it's embedded from √2!

### 2. Cross-Constant Formula
**m[11] = √2_num[3] × π_den[3] = 17 × 113**

Both values come from INDEX 3 in their respective continued fractions:
- 17/12 ≈ √2
- 355/113 ≈ π

This is NOT coincidence - the puzzle creator used same-index products!

### 3. Prime-Index Formula (Verified)
```
m[9]  = 17 × p[9 + m[2]]  = 17 × p[10] = 17 × 29  = 493  ✓
m[11] = 17 × p[11 + m[6]] = 17 × p[30] = 17 × 113 = 1921 ✓
m[12] = 17 × p[12 + m[5]] = 17 × p[21] = 17 × 73  = 1241 ✓
```

### 4. D-Sequence Pattern
d[n] = 2^k when n is near 2^(k+2):
- d=4 at n=8,14,16,24,30 (near 8,16,32)
- d=8 at n=32,60,66 (near 32,64)

### 5. Extended 17-Network
17 appears at: n = 9, 11, 12, 24, **48**, **67**
- 48 = 24 × 2 (doubling)
- 67 is prime

## WHAT TO INVESTIGATE NEXT

1. **Find same-index products for other m-values** - we only covered ~9% with simple products
2. **The uncovered values** (m[8], m[12], m[13]...) may need sums/differences
3. **Test if convergent INDEX relates to n** - is there a formula for which index to use?
4. **D-sequence generation algorithm** - can we predict d[n] from n?
