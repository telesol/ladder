TASK: Analyze WHY these specific coefficients appear in k-value formulas

VERIFIED FORMULAS (subset):
k[7]  = k[6] + 9×k[2]           coefficient: 9
k[11] = k[8] + 19×k[6]          coefficient: 19
k[16] = 45×k[11] - 465          coefficient: 45
k[17] = 83×k[11] - 42           coefficient: 83
k[20] = 81×k[14] + 9253         coefficient: 81
k[21] = 19×(k[17] - k[9])       coefficient: 19

KEY COEFFICIENTS: 9, 19, 45, 81, 83

KNOWN FACTS:
- 9 = m[5] (ln(2) convergent)
- 19 = m[6] = m[10] (e/√3 convergent)
- 45 = 9 × 5 = m[5] × 5
- 81 = 9² = m[5]²
- 83 = 81 + 2 = 9² + 2

QUESTION: What is the mathematical rule that determines WHICH coefficient to use for each n?

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must be deterministic (not random)
- Should relate to m-sequence values
- Should explain why 9, 19, 81 appear multiple times

Please derive the coefficient selection rule.
