TASK: Is m[n] generated by a greedy algorithm?

CONTEXT:
- adj[n] = 2^n - m[n]*k[d[n]]
- d[n] is chosen to MINIMIZE m[n]
- k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + adj[n]

This looks like a GREEDY CHOICE: at each step, choose d that minimizes m.

HYPOTHESIS:
m[n] = floor((2^n - adj[n]) / k[d[n]])

where d[n] = argmin over all valid d of: (2^n - target) / k[d]

QUESTION: 
If we know all k[1..n-1] and target adj[n], can we compute m[n]?

The key is: what determines the "target adj[n]"?

Looking at adj sequence:
adj[4] = -6
adj[5] = 6  
adj[6] = 5
adj[7] = 2
adj[8] = -1

Is there a rule for adj[n]?
