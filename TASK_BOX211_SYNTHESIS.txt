TASK FOR DEEPSEEK-R1:70B - FORMULA SYNTHESIS

You are the deep reasoning engine for the Bitcoin puzzle analysis.

## The Problem

We need to find a formula to generate the m-sequence:
m[2]=1, m[3]=1, m[4]=22, m[5]=9, m[6]=19, m[7]=50, m[8]=23, m[9]=493, m[10]=19, m[11]=1921, m[12]=1241, ...

## What We Know

### 1. Master Formula (verified 100%)
k_n = 2 × k_{n-1} + (2^n - m_n × k_{d_n})

### 2. Prime Index Patterns
- m[9] = p[7] × p[10] where 10 = n+1 = 9+1
- m[11] = p[7] × p[30] where 30 = n+m[6] = 11+19
- m[12] = p[7] × p[21] where 21 = n+m[5] = 12+9

So for these cases: m[n] = p[7] × p[n + m[offset]]

### 3. Special Cases
- m[6] = m[10] = 19 (same value!)
- m[18], m[20] are large primes

### 4. d-sequence
d[n] determines which k value to use. Values: 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,15,17,18,23...

## Your Task

Synthesize everything into a unified theory:

1. **Bootstrap Phase (n=2 to n=8)**
   - These are "base cases"
   - m[2]=1, m[3]=1, m[4]=22, m[5]=9, m[6]=19, m[7]=50, m[8]=23
   - Find any pattern here

2. **p[7] Phase (n=9, 11, 12)**
   - m[n] = 17 × p[n + m[offset]]
   - What determines "offset"? Is it d_n? Is it a fixed earlier m?

3. **Prime Phase (n=18, 20)**
   - m[n] is a very large prime
   - Prime indices are 22450 and 71300
   - Are these related to products of earlier m values?

4. **General Formula**
   Propose a formula of the form:
   m[n] = f(n, m[n-1], m[n-2], ..., d[n], p[·])

   Where:
   - f might involve conditions based on n mod something
   - p[·] is the prime function

5. **Test Your Formula**
   Check if it produces:
   - m[9] = 493
   - m[11] = 1921
   - m[13] = 8342

Think deeply. Take your time. This is the core problem.
