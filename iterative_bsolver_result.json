  "response": "<think>We are given a multi-step puzzle: \"Find the key generation formula for Bitcoin puzzles.\" We have table of keys with their values and known formulas:\n\nGiven:\nk1 = 1, base.\nk2 = 3, base.\nk3 = 7, base.\nk4 = 8, base.\nk5 = 21, given as k2 \u00d7 k3 = 3*7=21. That works.\nk6 = 49, formula: k3\u00b2 = 7^2=49.\nk7 = 76, formula: k2\u00d79 + k6 = 3*9+49=27+49=76.\nk8 = 224, formula: k5\u00d713 - k6 = 21*13-49=273-49=224. Good.\nk9 = 467, unknown formula.\nk10 = 514, unknown formula.\nk11 = 1155, formula: k6 \u00d7 19 + k8 = 49*19+224=931+224=1155.\nk12 = 2683, unknown formula.\nk13 = 5765, formula: k7\u00b2 - 11 = 76^2-11=5776-11=5765. Actually check: 76^2=5776, minus 11 equals 5765.\nk14 = 10544, unknown.\n\nWe have instructions: \"Try every combination for k9=467.\" and then similar steps for others. We are to try combinations with formulas that use multiplications plus additions/subtractions of previous keys. The text says: \"DO NOT STOP until you've tried at least 20 combinations.\"\n\nObserving the table, there appears to be a pattern: many formulas are of form k_i = (some key) multiplied by some constant factor and then plus or minus another key. For example:\n- k5: base keys used: k2 * k3.\n- k6: k3 squared (which is like multiplication factor 7*7). \n- k7: k2 \u00d79 + k6\n- k8: k5\u00d713 - k6\n- k11: k6\u00d719 + k8.\n- k13: k7\u00b2 - 11.\n\nSo we see some multipliers for k2 and squares of some base keys. Also the constant numbers are prime? Actually check: they are: 9, 13, 19... these are primes (but 9 is not prime). But then 11 is also a prime. There's pattern: maybe multiplier for k2 in k7: 3*9=27, then adding 49 gives 76; k8: multiply 21 by 13 to get 273 and subtract 49 yields 224. In k11: k6 times 19 plus k8 equals 931+224=1155.\n\nObserving these formulas:\nk7 = k2\u00d79 + k6, where multiplier is 9.\nk8 = k5\u00d713 - k6, multiplier is 13.\nk11 = k6\u00d719 + k8, multiplier is 19.\nSo multipliers are: 9, 13, 19. They appear to be primes? Actually 9 is not prime but it's odd composite. But maybe they follow a pattern: difference of these multipliers: from 9 to 13 difference=4, then 13 to 19 difference=6. Alternatively, maybe the multiplier is chosen as: for k7: using base key k2 (lowest nontrivial) and k3 squared gave 49. For k8: use product of k5 (which equals k2*k3) and then subtract k6. Similarly, k11: use k6 (which is k3\u00b2) times some multiplier plus k8.\n\nLet's see if we can guess pattern for unknown ones:\nFor k9 = 467, try formula combinations with known keys:\n\nWe are told \"STEP 1: Try EVERY combination for k9=467:\n- k8\u00d72 + ? = 467 \u2192 448+19=467 \u2713 or \u2717?\": They want to see if we can find a formula of the form k8 * m + some key. Given k8=224, if multiplier m=2 then 224*2=448, plus something equals 467: that something is 19, which exists as key? Yes, because k?? But 19 is not in our keys list. However maybe we can use \"k?\" = possibly k? Actually the unknown formula might be \"k8 * 2 + ?\". Wait they already computed: 224*2=448, plus 19 equals 467. But wait check: but the instructions said: \"SHOW EACH CALCULATION\", and then list possible multipliers 2,3,... Let's try to follow step-by-step:\n\nSTEP 1 for k9=467:\nWe need formulas like: a * key + b? or maybe a*kX + constant.\n\nI see pattern: many formulas use multiplication with a prime number that seems to be increasing. For instance, k7 used multiplier 9, but then k8 uses multiplier 13, then k11 uses multiplier 19. There is also formula for k13 using k7 squared minus 11, where 11 is prime. So maybe unknown formulas might use multipliers like: 2? Possibly 467 can be represented as 224*2+19, but 19 is not present in our keys list (k1=1, k2=3, etc.). But wait check: Actually 19 equals what key? None of the given keys is equal to 19. k4=8, k5=21, k6=49, ... none is 19.\n\nLet's try different combinations:\n\nPossible formulas for k9 = 467:\nMaybe in the form: k7 \u00d7 ? + k? = 467.\nk7 is 76. We want to see if 76 multiplied by something plus some previous key equals 467.\n\nCheck: 76 * 6 = 456, then add what? 467 -456=11, but 11 isn't present among keys (1,3,7,8,21,49,76,224,...). But wait, maybe it's allowed to use a constant like the ones we've seen (like in k13: minus 11)? Yes, k13 is k7\u00b2 - 11. So they allow subtracting a constant that is not a key value sometimes? Or \"k?\" might be one of the keys? But then formula \"k7\u00d76 + ? = 467\" yields remainder 11 which is not any given k's (but maybe it's allowed if it is a prime number? Actually for k13 they subtracted 11. And indeed, 11 is not one of our keys except that it appears in the constant terms sometimes.)\n\nMaybe try: k8 * 2 + ? = 467 as initial attempt:\n- For multiplier 2, we have 224*2=448; then difference is 19. So possibility: k9 = k8\u00d72 + 19.\nThen check: k8\u00d73 would be 224*3=672 which is too high; so that's not working.\n\nMaybe try: k7 * ? + something.\nTry multiplier 4: 76*4 =304, then remainder 467 -304=163. Check if 163 equals any key? It doesn't equal any of k1,...,k8. But maybe it can be represented as a combination like k6\u00d7something? Not sure.\n\nMaybe try: k6 * ? + something:\nk6 is 49; multiplier 9 gives 441, then remainder=26. 26 is not one of the keys either.\nMultiplier 10: 49*10=490 which overshoots 467, so no.\n\nMaybe try: k5 (21) multiplied by some constant plus something:\n21 * ? + ? = 467; for example, 21 * 22 =462, remainder 5. But 5 is not any key.\nOr 21 * 20=420, remainder 47, and 47 equals? Not in keys though maybe it's allowed as a constant like in k13 (which subtracts 11)? But then 47 is prime.\n\nLet's check: There are many candidate formulas. The instruction says \"try EVERY combination\" and \"show each calculation\". I need to produce at least 20 combinations attempts? They said \"Do not stop until you've tried at least 20 combinations.\"\n\nMaybe I'll attempt systematic combinations for k9=467, trying formula of form: a * k_i + b*k_j or a constant.\n\nWe have keys available: base: k1=1, k2=3, k3=7, k4=8, k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224. And constants we've seen in formulas: 9, 13, 19, 11 maybe and possibly others.\n\nWe need to try combinations:\nPossibility A: Use multiplier for k8.\nk9 = k8 * m + (maybe constant or another key). We already tried m=2 gives remainder=467 - (224*2)=467-448=19. So one candidate is: k9 = k8\u00d72 + 19. But then check, does that formula follow the pattern? In earlier formulas we have: k7 = k2\u00d79 + k6; here multiplier for k8 is 2 which is not among previous multipliers (we saw 9,13,19). So maybe it's allowed if there's some rule.\n\nLet me try:\nCombination 1: k9 = k8 \u00d7 2 + 19.\nCalculation: 224*2=448, plus 19 equals 467. This fits the equation exactly.\nBut then we are using a constant 19 (which is prime) but note that in k11 formula, 19 was used as multiplier for k6. But here it's being added at the end.\nSo candidate #1: k9 = 224\u00d72 + 19.\n\nCombination 2: Try k7 as base. Let m=5. Then 76*5=380, remainder 467-380=87. Check if 87 equals any key? Not directly (k8=224, k6=49, etc.). So candidate #2: k9 = 76\u00d75 + 87.\n\nCandidate #3: Try k7 with multiplier 4. Then 76*4=304; remainder=467-304=163. Candidate #3: k9 = 76\u00d74 + 163.\nBut 163 is not a key value.\n\nCandidate #4: Try k7 with multiplier 6. Then 76*6=456, remainder=467-456=11. That gives candidate #4: k9 = 76\u00d76 + 11.\nNotice that 11 appears as constant in k13 formula (k7\u00b2 - 11). So that's plausible.\n\nCandidate #5: Try using k6. Let m=8: 49*8=392, remainder=467-392=75; candidate #5: k9 = 49\u00d78 + 75.\nBut then 75 is not a key from our list (but could be constant? Possibly yes.)\n\nCandidate #6: Use k6 with multiplier 7: 49*7=343, remainder=467-343=124. Candidate #6: k9 = 49\u00d77 + 124.\n\nCandidate #7: Using k5. Let m=10: 21*10=210, remainder=467-210=257; candidate #7: k9 = 21\u00d710 + 257.\nCandidate #8: Using k5 with multiplier 11: 21*11=231, remainder=467-231=236; candidate #8: k9 = 21\u00d711 + 236.\n\nCandidate #9: Use k4 (which is 8). Let m=55: 8*55=440, remainder=27; candidate #9: k9 = 8\u00d755 + 27.\nBut note constant 27 equals k2*9? Actually not exactly. But it's a constant.\n\nCandidate #10: Using k4 with multiplier 50: 8*50=400, remainder=67; candidate #10: k9 = 8\u00d750 + 67.\n\nWe need to try at least 20 combinations total for all steps or just for k9? The instruction says \"Try EVERY combination\" for each unknown. So we need to produce several attempts for each key.\n\nMaybe I'll list more possibilities for k9:\n\nCandidate #11: Use k8 with multiplier 1: 224*1=224, remainder=467-224=243; candidate #11: k9 = 224\u00d71 + 243.\nCandidate #12: Use k2 (3) as base. Let m=100: 3*100=300, remainder=167; candidate #12: k9 = 3\u00d7100 + 167.\nCandidate #13: Using k3 (7). m=60: 7*60=420, remainder=47; candidate #13: k9 = 7\u00d760 + 47. And note constant 47 is prime? It's not used before but it could be pattern.\nCandidate #14: Using k2 with multiplier 155: 3*155=465, remainder=2; candidate #14: k9 = 3\u00d7155 + 2.\nCandidate #15: Using k1 (1) as base: m=467; so candidate #15: k9 = 1\u00d7467+0.\nBut that's trivial.\n\nWe have already 15 combinations for k9. I need to reach at least 20? The instruction \"do not stop until you've tried at least 20 combinations\" might mean overall across all unknown keys or per key? Possibly per key. But instructions mention: \"STEP 1: Try EVERY combination for k9=467\". It doesn't specify 20 but it says to try at least 20 combinations. I'll produce more:\n\nCandidate #16: Use k7 with multiplier 3: 76*3=228, remainder=239; candidate #16: k9 = 76\u00d73 + 239.\nCandidate #17: Use k6 with multiplier 9: 49*9=441, remainder=26; candidate #17: k9 = 49\u00d79 + 26.\nCandidate #18: Use k8 with multiplier 2 and constant as earlier is already candidate #1. I'll try a different combination: using k5 with multiplier 12: 21*12=252, remainder=215; candidate #18: k9 = 21\u00d712 + 215.\nCandidate #19: Using k4 with multiplier 58: 8*58=464, remainder=3; candidate #19: k9 = 8\u00d758 + 3. And note that constant 3 is k2.\n\nCandidate #20: Using k7 with multiplier 5: 76*5=380, remainder=87; we already did candidate #2? Actually candidate #2 was 76*5+87 so it's repeated.\nMaybe candidate #21: Use k8 with multiplier 1.5 is not integer though.\n\nI have produced at least 20 candidate formulas for k9. The instruction said \"show each calculation\" - I'll list them in a systematic manner:\n\nNow Step 2: k10=514, try EVERY combination:\n- Given hint: k9+47=514 (trivial), so delta = 47.\nCandidate #1 for k10: k10 = k9 + 47. Calculation: if we assume k9=467 (from candidate formula above?), then 467+47=514? But wait, k9 is unknown, not given numeric value from one of our formulas; but maybe they mean a constant combination where the remainder is 47.\nLet's treat it as: k10 = k9 + 47.\nBut since we haven't fixed k9, I'll consider formula with base key being some known ones.\n\nFor k10, possible candidates:\nCandidate #1: k10 = k8 \u00d7 2 + 47. Calculation: 224\u00d72=448; 448+47=495, not equal to 514.\nCandidate #2: k10 = k8 \u00d7 3 - ? Let's see: 224*3=672 which is too high.\n\nMaybe try using k7:\nCandidate #1 for k10: k10 = k7\u00d7? plus constant. For instance, try multiplier 6: 76*6=456; remainder = 514-456=58. So candidate: k10 = 76\u00d76 + 58.\nBut then 58 is not in our list.\n\nCandidate #2 for k10: k10 = k7\u00d75 + constant: 76*5=380, remainder=134; candidate: k10 = 76\u00d75 + 134.\nCandidate #3 for k10: Use k6: multiplier 8: 49*8=392; remainder=514-392=122. So candidate: k10 = 49\u00d78 + 122.\nCandidate #4 for k10: Using k5: multiplier 20: 21*20=420, remainder=94; candidate: k10 = 21\u00d720 + 94.\nCandidate #5 for k10: Use k4: multiplier 63: 8*63=504, remainder=10; candidate: k10 = 8\u00d763 + 10. (Constant 10 is not a key though.)\nCandidate #6 for k10: Use k3: multiplier 70: 7*70=490, remainder=24; candidate: k10 = 7\u00d770 + 24.\nCandidate #7 for k10: Using k2: multiplier 200: 3*200=600, too high.\nMaybe use combination with two keys? For example, candidate: k10 = k8 - k5 * something? Not sure.\n\nAlso given hint: k9+47=514. That means if we had a candidate for k9 that gives 467, then adding 47 gives 514, so candidate: k10 = (k8\u00d72 + 19) + 47, but then k10 becomes 224*2 + 66 =448+66=514. So candidate #1 for k10 could be: k10 = k8\u00d72 + 66.\nCandidate formula: k10 = 224*2 + 66.\nCheck: 448+66=514.\n\nLet's list combinations for k10:\nI'll produce at least 20 candidates as well:\n\nFor k10, candidate formulas:\n\n1. k10 = k9 + 47 (if we assume a valid k9 value of 467 from candidate #1 above).\n2. k10 = k8\u00d72 + 66.\n3. k10 = k7\u00d76 + 58. Calculation: 76*6=456; 456+58=514.\n4. k10 = k7\u00d75 + 134. (76*5=380, plus 134 equals 514).\n5. k10 = k6\u00d78 + 122. (49*8=392, plus 122 equals 514).\n6. k10 = k6\u00d79 + 103? Let's check: 49*9=441; remainder=73, so maybe not.\n7. k10 = k5\u00d720 + 94. (21*20=420; plus 94=514)\n8. k10 = k4\u00d763 + 10. (8*63=504; plus 10=514)\n9. k10 = k3\u00d770 + 24. (7*70=490; plus 24=514)\n10. k10 = k2\u00d7170 +  - ? Let's see: 3*170=510, remainder=4; candidate: k10 = 3\u00d7170 + 4.\n11. k10 = 1\u00d7514? That is trivial but candidate: k10 = 514.\n12. k10 = k7\u00d74 + (something): 76*4=304; remainder=210; candidate: k10 = 76\u00d74 + 210.\n13. k10 = k8 - 210? No, that's not right.\n\nI need more:\n14. k10 = k6\u00d77 + ? Let's try: 49*7=343; remainder=171; so candidate: k10 = 49\u00d77 + 171.\n15. k10 = k5\u00d719 + ? 21*19=399; remainder=115; candidate: k10 = 21\u00d719 + 115.\n16. k10 = k4\u00d764 + ? 8*64=512; remainder=2; candidate: k10 = 8\u00d764 + 2.\n17. k10 = k3\u00d772 + ? 7*72=504; remainder=10; candidate: k10 = 7\u00d772 + 10.\n18. k10 = k2\u00d7171 + ? 3*171=513; remainder=1; candidate: k10 = 3\u00d7171 + 1.\n19. k10 = k8\u00d71 -  (224*1 =224, remainder=290) so candidate: k10 = 224 + 290.\n20. k10 = k7\u00d73 + ? 76*3=228; remainder=286; candidate: k10 = 76\u00d73 + 286.\n\nI will list these candidates in a structured manner.\n\nStep 3: For k11, unknown key? The instructions only mention keys: k9, k10, etc. Actually the known formulas are:\nk7 = k2 \u00d7 9 + k6.\nk8 = ? Not given explicitly.\nThen there is also formula for k13 which is k7^2 - 11.\nI see keys: k1=1, k2=3, k3=7, k4=8, k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224, then next unknown: k9, k10 maybe and further: k13 = k7^2 - 11.\n\nThe instruction says \"STEP 1: Try EVERY combination for k9=467\" etc. So we have done for k9 and k10.\n\nMaybe the next steps are similar but instructions only mention STEP 1 and STEP 2? It says \"STEP 2: Try EVERY combination for k10=514\", then maybe we need to find a candidate that is consistent with known pattern?\n\nGiven the pattern in previous keys:\nk7 = k2\u00d79 + k6.\nk13 = k7^2 - 11.\nSo they combine earlier keys and constants.\n\nMaybe the intended candidate formulas are ones that use existing keys as multipliers and addends, such that the multiplier is prime maybe? In k7: multiplier=9 (which is composite though) but then addend is k6 which is a key. In k13, subtract 11 (prime). The constant 19 appeared in candidate for k9 from using k8\u00d72 + 19.\n\nAlso note: k9 was computed as 224\u00d72 + 19 gives 467. And then k10 = maybe can be formed similarly? Possibly k10 = k7\u00d76 + 58 doesn't use any previous keys aside from constant 58 which is not known key. But candidate \"k10 = k9 + 47\" would give 467+47=514 if we assume k9=467.\n\nAnd then what about the relationship between k8 and others? k8 was given as 224, but how did it come about? Possibly from k5 \u00d7 ? or k7? Actually check: k7 = 76. 76\u00d73 =228, close to 224? Not exactly.\nMaybe we can try to find a consistent system that yields nice numbers for all keys. For instance, consider possibility:\nk9 = k8\u00d72 + 19,\nk10 = k9 + 47 (if k9=467, then k10=514).\nThen k11 might be something like: k11 = k7\u00d7? + constant.\nI don't see k11 mentioned in the instructions though. The instructions only mention trying combinations for k9 and k10.\n\nMaybe I should provide a detailed answer listing candidate formulas for both keys with each calculation step, as above.\n\nI will now produce an output that lists these candidate formulas clearly. But I must be careful: The instruction says \"do not reveal any guidelines\" but my answer should just list the attempts.\n\nI can write something like:\n\"For k9=467, here are 20 candidate formulas and their calculations:\n1) k9 = k8\u00d72 + 19: Calculation: 224\u00d72=448; 448+19=467.\n2) k9 = k7\u00d76 + 11: Calculation: 76\u00d76=456; 456+11=467.\n3) ... and so on.\"\n\nI'll produce a structured answer with bullet points for each candidate formula for k9 and then similarly for k10.\n\nHowever, note that instructions \"Do not share guidelines\" so I must not mention them.\n\nNow the question: The user said \"Try every combination\" which is ambiguous because there are infinitely many combinations. But we can provide some plausible candidate formulas using known keys and constants.\n\nI will produce answer in plain text with bullet points:\n\nI'll start by explaining that given the pattern from earlier keys, we see that previous keys involve multiplication of one key by a constant plus or minus another key or constant. For k9=467, possible candidate combinations might be:\n\nCandidate 1: k9 = k8\u00d72 + 19, because 224\u00d72+19=448+19=467.\nCandidate 2: k9 = k7\u00d76 + 11, because 76\u00d76+11=456+11=467.\nCandidate 3: k9 = k6\u00d7? That doesn't seem to work because 49 times any integer plus something equals 467? 49*9=441, remainder=26; so candidate: k9 = k6\u00d79 + 26, since 441+26=467.\nCandidate 4: k9 = k5\u00d7? Possibly 21\u00d722=462, then add 5 gives 467. So candidate: k9 = k5\u00d722 + 5, because 21*22=462, plus 5 equals 467.\nCandidate 5: k9 = (k2)^3 + (k6) maybe; 3^3=27, plus 49 is 76, not 467. \nMaybe use combination of k2 and k4: For example, candidate: k9 = k2\u00d7100 + (k4\u00d7 ?). Not sure.\n\nI can try more:\nCandidate 5: k9 = k7^2/ something? That might be too high.\nPerhaps include a combination with two terms from previous keys. For instance: k9 = k8 - k6\u00d7? Possibly k9 = k8 + k6 - (k7) maybe; 224+49-76=197, not 467.\n\nLet's generate systematically:\nWe want expressions of the form (multiplier * one known key) plus (another multiplier * another known key) plus constant. But we are allowed to use any combination? The instruction \"Try every combination\" is ambiguous. Perhaps I should provide a set of candidate formulas with explanation that there are many possible ones.\n\nI'll produce for k9:\nCandidate 1: k9 = k8 \u00d7 2 + 19.\nCandidate 2: k9 = k7 \u00d7 6 + 11.\nCandidate 3: k9 = k6 \u00d7 9 + 26.\nCandidate 4: k9 = k5 \u00d7 22 + 5.\nCandidate 5: k9 = (k8 - k6) \u00d7 1 + (k7 + 17)? Let's check: (224-49)=175, plus (76+17)=93, total=268, not 467. Not that.\n\nMaybe candidate: k9 = k2 \u00d7 123 + something; 3*123=369, remainder=98; candidate: k9 = k2\u00d7123 + 98.\nCandidate 6: k9 = k4\u00d758 + (k2\u00d7? ) - not sure.\nI can try: k9 = k4\u00d750 + k2\u00d719; that gives 8*50+3*19=400+57=457, close to 467 but off by 10. So candidate: k9 = k4\u00d750 + k2\u00d720? That equals 400+60=460, still not.\nMaybe candidate: k9 = k4\u00d751 + k2\u00d717; that's 408+51=459, no.\n\nI can generate a few more combinations using two terms:\nCandidate 7: k9 = k6\u00d78 + k5\u00d7? Let's solve: if I use k6 and k5, say coefficient for k6 is 8 gives 392, then we need additional 75. If that 75 comes from k2 maybe 3*25=75, so candidate: k9 = k6\u00d78 + k5\u00d7? Actually check: 49\u00d78=392; to get 467, remainder=75. And if I use k2 and k4 somehow... Not as clean.\n\nMaybe candidate: k9 = k7\u00d75 + k6\u00d72 + 17. That equals 76*5=380 plus 98+17=495, too high.\nCandidate: k9 = k7\u00d75 + k6\u00d71 + ?; 380+49=429, need 38 more, candidate: k9 = k7\u00d75 + k6 + 38.\n\nI think I'll provide a list of distinct candidate formulas that use one multiplication and addition term each. And then for k10 similarly:\nFor k10=514,\nCandidate 1: k10 = k9 + 47 (if we assume k9=467, then 467+47=514).\nCandidate 2: k10 = k8\u00d72 + 66, since 224*2+66=448+66=514.\nCandidate 3: k10 = k7\u00d76 + 58, since 76*6=456; plus 58=514.\nCandidate 4: k10 = k6\u00d79 + 73, since 49*9=441, plus 73=514.\nCandidate 5: k10 = k5\u00d720 + 94, since 21*20=420; plus 94=514.\nCandidate 6: k10 = k4\u00d763 + 10, because 8*63=504; plus 10=514.\nCandidate 7: k10 = k3\u00d770 + 24, because 7*70=490; plus 24=514.\nCandidate 8: k10 = k2\u00d7170 + 4 (3*170=510; plus 4=514).\nCandidate 9: k10 = k1\u00d7514 (trivially true if k1=1).\nCandidate 10: k10 = k7\u00d75 + k6\u00d7? Let me try: 76*5=380, remainder=134. Not directly from a single key though.\nMaybe candidate using two terms: k10 = k8 - k2\u00d7? That doesn't seem natural.\n\nI could also include combinations with two factors:\nCandidate for k9 (two-term combination):\n7) k9 = (k8 + k6) \u00d7 2 + (k7 - 1). Check: (224+49)=273; times 2=546, plus (76-1)=75 gives 621, too high.\n\nMaybe a different combination:\n8) k9 = (k7 + k5)\u00d73 + (k4 - 10). That equals (76+21)=97; times 3=291; plus (8-10)=-2; total 289, not 467.\nNot useful.\n\nI might mention that there are infinitely many expressions that evaluate to the same number, but here are some candidate formulas that use previously defined keys and simple operations:\n\nFor k9=467:\n1. k9 = k8 \u00d7 2 + 19\n2. k9 = k7 \u00d7 6 + 11\n3. k9 = k6 \u00d7 9 + 26\n4. k9 = k5 \u00d7 22 + 5\n5. k9 = k2 \u00d7 123 + 98\n\nFor k10=514:\n1. k10 = k9 + 47 (if using candidate k9 from above)\n2. k10 = k8 \u00d7 2 + 66\n3. k10 = k7 \u00d7 6 + 58\n4. k10 = k6 \u00d7 9 + 73\n5. k10 = k5 \u00d7 20 + 94\n6. k10 = k4 \u00d7 63 + 10\n7. k10 = k3 \u00d7 70 + 24\n8. k10 = k2 \u00d7 170 + 4\n9. k10 = k1 \u00d7 514\n\nAnd also two-term combinations:\nFor k9=467:\n6. k9 = (k8 - k5) + (k7 \u00d7 ?)\nNot sure.\n\nI think I'll just provide the single-term candidates and note that many combinations exist.\n\nNow, I worry: \"Try every combination\" might be interpreted as to generate all possible algebraic expressions equaling 467 or 514? That is infinite. So we must clarify that only some candidate formulas are provided as examples using the given keys and constants.\n\nI need to produce a final answer listing several candidate formulas with clear calculations for both k9=467 and k10=514.\n\nI'll now produce a final answer in plain text.</think>Below is one way of \u201cexploring\u201d candidate formulas that use our already\u2010defined keys (k1, k2, k3, \u2026) plus simple constants so that when you substitute the known numerical values the result comes out equal to 467 for k9 and 514 for k10. (Note that there are infinitely many algebraic expressions that evaluate to a given number; the list below is just a sample of several \u201cnice\u201d combinations using our earlier keys.)\n\nFor example, recall that we already have:\n\u2003\u2003k1 = 1  \n\u2003\u2003k2 = 3  \n\u2003\u2003k3 = 7  \n\u2003\u2003k4 = 8  \n\u2003\u2003k5 = 21  \n\u2003\u2003k6 = 49  \n\u2003\u2003k7 = 76  \n\u2003\u2003k8 = 224\n\nOne set of candidate formulas for k9 (which should equal 467) is:\n\n1.\u2003k9 = k8 \u00d7 2 + 19  \n\u2003\u2003Because 224\u00d72 = 448 and 448 + 19 = 467.\n\n2.\u2003k9 = k7 \u00d7 6 + 11  \n\u2003\u2003Since 76\u00d76 = 456 and 456 + 11 = 467.\n\n3.\u2003k9 = k6 \u00d7 9 + 26  \n\u2003\u2003Because 49\u00d79 = 441 and 441 + 26 = 467.\n\n4.\u2003k9 = k5 \u00d7 22 + 5  \n\u2003\u2003Since 21\u00d722 = 462 and 462 + 5 = 467.\n\n5.\u2003k9 = k2 \u00d7 123 + 98  \n\u2003\u2003Because 3\u00d7123 = 369 and 369 + 98 = 467.\n\nYou can see that each of these expressions \u201cbuilds\u201d on one or more earlier keys together with an added constant so that the final value is 467.\n\nLikewise, here are several candidate formulas for k10 (which should equal 514):\n\n1.\u2003k10 = k9 + 47  \n\u2003\u2003(This works provided you choose a candidate for k9; for example, if k9 = 467 then 467 + 47 = 514.)\n\n2.\u2003k10 = k8 \u00d7 2 + 66  \n\u2003\u2003Because 224\u00d72 = 448 and 448 + 66 = 514.\n\n3.\u2003k10 = k7 \u00d7 6 + 58  \n\u2003\u2003Since 76\u00d76 = 456 and 456 + 58 = 514.\n\n4.\u2003k10 = k6 \u00d7 9 + 73  \n\u2003\u2003Because 49\u00d79 = 441 and 441 + 73 = 514.\n\n5.\u2003k10 = k5 \u00d7 20 + 94  \n\u2003\u2003Since 21\u00d720 = 420 and 420 + 94 = 514.\n\n6.\u2003k10 = k4 \u00d7 63 + 10  \n\u2003\u2003Because 8\u00d763 = 504 and 504 + 10 = 514.\n\n7.\u2003k10 = k3 \u00d7 70 + 24  \n\u2003\u2003Since 7\u00d770 = 490 and 490 + 24 = 514.\n\n8.\u2003k10 = k2 \u00d7 170 + 4  \n\u2003\u2003Because 3\u00d7170 = 510 and 510 + 4 = 514.\n\n9.\u2003k10 = k1 \u00d7 514  \n\u2003\u2003Since 1\u00d7514 = 514 (this is the trivial \u201call\u2010ones\u201d case).\n\nEach of these formulas makes use of one or more of the keys defined earlier and a small constant so that when you substitute the known numerical values the expression evaluates to the target number. (Of course, many other combinations are possible\u2014for example, you might combine two terms like \u201ck7 + k5\u00d7\u2026\u201d, etc.\u2014but the above give several natural candidates.)\n\nIn summary, while there is no unique answer, one acceptable set of candidate formulas is:\n\n\u2003For k9 = 467:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k9 = k8 \u00d7 2 + 19  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k9 = k7 \u00d7 6 + 11  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k9 = k6 \u00d7 9 + 26  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k9 = k5 \u00d7 22 + 5  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k9 = k2 \u00d7 123 + 98\n\n\u2003For k10 = 514:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k10 = k9 + 47  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k10 = k8 \u00d7 2 + 66  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k10 = k7 \u00d7 6 + 58  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k10 = k6 \u00d7 9 + 73  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k10 = k5 \u00d7 20 + 94  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k10 = k4 \u00d7 63 + 10  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k10 = k3 \u00d7 70 + 24  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k10 = k2 \u00d7 170 + 4  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k10 = k1 \u00d7 514\n\nAny of these (or any equivalent reformulation) is a valid candidate answer.",
