TASK: Deep Binary/Hex Structure Analysis
MODEL: qwen3:32b or phi4:14b
TIME: Deep analysis

## CONTEXT
The Bitcoin puzzle keys have specific binary structure we need to understand.

## KEY VALUES (Binary)
k[1] = 1 = 0b1
k[2] = 3 = 0b11
k[3] = 7 = 0b111
k[4] = 8 = 0b1000 (exactly 2^3, SPARSE - only 1 bit)
k[5] = 21 = 0b10101 (alternating pattern)
k[6] = 49 = 0b110001
k[7] = 76 = 0b1001100
k[8] = 224 = 0b11100000
k[9] = 467 = 0b111010011
k[10] = 514 = 0b1000000010 (SPARSE - only 2 bits)

## OBSERVATIONS
- k[1,2,3] = 2^n - 1 (all bits set, Mersenne-like)
- k[4] = exactly 2^3 (power of 2)
- k[10] = 2^9 + 2 (only 2 bits set)
- These sparse keys are at MINIMUM position in their range

## YOUR TASK
1. Analyze the bit patterns for ALL k[1..70]
2. Find:
   - What determines sparseness vs density?
   - Is there a bit manipulation rule?
   - How does popcount (bits set) relate to n?
   - XOR relationships between consecutive keys

3. Look for:
   - Cyclic patterns
   - Bit rotation/shifting
   - Carry propagation patterns
   - Connection to the binary representation of n itself

## CONSTRAINTS
- NO BRUTE FORCE
- Show mathematical derivations
- Build a BIT GENERATOR that can reconstruct the keys

## OUTPUT
A bit-level construction rule for k[n] that reproduces all values.
