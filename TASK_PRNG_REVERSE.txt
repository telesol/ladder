TASK: PRNG Reverse Engineering
MODEL: deepseek-r1:70b or qwq:32b
TIME: Deep analysis (30+ minutes OK)

## CONTEXT (Read MEMORY.md for full context)
We have k[1..70] private keys. Need to find the PRNG that generates them.

## KEY VALUES
k[1]=1, k[2]=3, k[3]=7, k[4]=8, k[5]=21, k[6]=49, k[7]=76, k[8]=224
k[9]=467, k[10]=514, k[11]=1155, k[12]=2683, k[13]=5216, k[14]=10544

## VERIFIED FORMULA
k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + adj[n]
adj[n] = 2^n - m[n]*k[d[n]]

## YOUR TASK
1. The keys are NOT generated by the greedy algorithm we tested
2. Find what PRNG or deterministic process generates k[1..70]
3. Possibilities to explore:
   - Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)
   - Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)
   - Custom Bitcoin-related generator

4. For each hypothesis:
   - Derive the parameters mathematically
   - Verify against ALL known k values

## CONSTRAINTS
- NO BRUTE FORCE - only mathematical derivation
- Must be reproducible: given seed/params, generate k[1..70] exactly
