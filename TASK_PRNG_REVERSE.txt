TASK: Reverse-engineer the PRNG that generates the m-sequence

HYPOTHESIS: The puzzle creator used a PRNG seeded with a secret to generate the keys.

KNOWN DATA (first 20 m-values):
m = [1, 1, 22, 9, 19, 50, 23, 493, 19, 2045, 8342, 3469, 3499, 32845, 8470, 95823, 198669, ...]

OBSERVATION 1: Early values contain mathematical constants
- m[4] = 22 (π ≈ 22/7)
- m[6] = 19 (sqrt(3) convergent h[4])
- m[10] = 19 (same as m[6]!)

OBSERVATION 2: Some m-values are composite of earlier ones
- m[8] = m[2] + m[4] = 1 + 22 = 23
- m[10] = m[2] * m[6] = 1 * 19 = 19

OBSERVATION 3: Factor 19 appears repeatedly
- m[6] = 19
- m[10] = 19
- m[11] = 1921 = 19 × 101
- m[71] = 19 × 47,367,640,575,976,007,953

QUESTION:
Is there a PRNG (LCG, LFSR, Mersenne Twister variant) that produces this sequence?

Test:
1. LCG: m[n] = (a*m[n-1] + c) mod M
2. LFSR: m[n] = XOR of selected previous bits
3. Custom: m[n] = f(m[n-1], m[n-2], m[n-3], n)

Find parameters a, c, M or the recurrence that reproduces m[2..70].
