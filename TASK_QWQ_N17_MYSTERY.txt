TASK: Explain why the pattern breaks at n=17

CONTEXT:
The k-sequence follows k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + adj[n].
For n=2-16, the sign of adj follows a PERFECT ++- pattern (period 3).
At n=17, the pattern BREAKS. Expected '+' but got '-'.

KEY OBSERVATION: n=17 = p[7] (the 7th prime!)

DATA:
adj[14] = +112
adj[15] = +5779
adj[16] = -2224  (expected -, got -)
adj[17] = -7197  (expected +, got -)  <-- BREAK POINT
adj[18] = +7023  (expected +, got +)

k[17] = 95823 = 3^4 × 7 × 13^2 (highly structured!)

KNOWN PATTERNS IN n=1-16:
- k[5] = k[2] × k[3] = 3 × 7
- k[6] = k[3]^2 = 49
- k[7] = k[6] + 9×k[2] (coefficient 9 = m[5])
- k[11] = k[8] + 19×k[6] (coefficient 19 = m[6])
- k[16] = 45×k[11] - 465 (coefficient 45 = 9×5 = m[5]×5)

QUESTIONS:
1. Why does n=17 = p[7] cause the pattern to break?
2. Is there a mathematical reason the 7th prime is special?
3. Does 7 appear frequently in the formulas (k[3]=7, p[7]=17, etc.)?
4. What new pattern might start at n=17?

Think step by step. Show your reasoning.
