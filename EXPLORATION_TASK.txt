# EXPLORATION: How to Construct This Ladder?

## Mindset
We are EXPLORERS. We don't know the answer yet, and that's exciting.
Be curious. Think creatively. No idea is too wild.

## What We Observe (Facts Only)
The Bitcoin puzzle keys follow this pattern:
```
k_n = 2 * k_{n-1} + adj_n
```

Where adj_n can be decomposed as:
```
adj_n = 2^n - m_n * k_{d_n}
```

## The Actual Data (First 15 values)
```
n    k_n       adj_n    m_n     d_n   norm_m (m/2^(n-d))
2    3         1        3       1     1.5000 = 3/2

6    49        7        19      2     1.1875 = 19/16
7    76        -22      50      2     1.5625 = 25/16

## Interesting Observations (Not Conclusions!)

1. The first few norm_m values are CLEAN fractions:
   - 3/2, 7/4, 11/4, 9/8, 19/16, 25/16, 23/16
   - Numerators: 3, 7, 11, 9, 19, 25, 23
   - All denominators are powers of 2

2. Looking at the numerators: 3, 7, 11, 9, 19, 25, 23
   - 3, 7, 11, 19, 23 are PRIME
   - 9 = 3², 25 = 5²
   - Is there a pattern here?

3. The m values themselves: 3, 7, 22, 9, 19, 50, 23, 493...
   - m_2 = 3 = k_2
   - m_3 = 7 = k_3
   - m_4 = 22 = ?
   - m_5 = 9 = ?

4. Sign pattern of adj_n: +, +, -, +, +, -, +, +, -, +, +, -, ...
   - Looks like (+,+,-) repeating but breaks down

## The Question

If YOU were the puzzle creator, how would you construct a sequence generator that:
1. Produces the recurrence k_n = 2*k_{n-1} + adj_n
2. Results in norm_m values bounded in [0.72, 2.75]
3. Gives clean fractions at low n but more complex values at high n
4. Has some hidden structure that could be reverse-engineered

## Think About
- What simple seed or rule could produce 3, 7, 22, 9, 19, 50, 23, 493?
- Is there a connection between m_n and the key values k_1, k_2, ...?
- Could this be related to continued fractions?
- Could there be a simple formula hiding in plain sight?
- What would make sense from a puzzle-creator's perspective?

## Your Task
Don't try to SOLVE it. Try to UNDERSTAND it.
- What patterns do you see?
- What construction methods could produce this?
- What should we explore next?

Be creative. Be curious. Think like the puzzle creator.
