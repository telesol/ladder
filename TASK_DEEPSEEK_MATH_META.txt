TASK: Find the meta-rule for k-formula structure

CONTEXT:
Each k[n] is computed as a linear combination of earlier k values:
k[n] = a×k[i] + b×k[j] + c

But HOW does the puzzle creator choose which k[i] and k[j] to use?

OBSERVATIONS:
n=4:  uses k[1], k[3]  (indices: 1, 3)
n=5:  uses k[2], k[3]  (indices: 2, 3)
n=6:  uses k[3] only (squared)
n=7:  uses k[6], k[2]  (indices: 6, 2)
n=8:  uses k[3] only (with 2^5)
n=9:  uses k[7], k[5]  (indices: 7, 5)
n=10: uses k[4], k[6]  (indices: 4, 6)
n=11: uses k[8], k[6]  (indices: 8, 6)
n=12: uses k[8], k[1]  (indices: 8, 1)
n=13: uses k[7], k[10] (indices: 7, 10)
n=14: uses k[13], k[3] (indices: 13, 3)
n=15: uses k[12], k[1] (indices: 12, 1)
n=16: uses k[11] only (indices: 11)

PATTERN HINTS:
- k[3]=7 is used very often (n=4,5,6,8,14)
- k[1]=1 is used for small offsets (n=4,12,15)
- k[6]=49 is used repeatedly (n=7,10,11)
- Recent k values often used: k[n-1] or k[n-2]

QUESTIONS:
1. Is there a formula for choosing i given n?
2. Is there a formula for choosing j given n?
3. Does d[n] influence which k values to use?
4. Is the choice related to factorization of n or k[n]?

D-SEQUENCE FOR REFERENCE:
d[2]=2, d[3]=3, d[4]=1, d[5]=2, d[6]=2, d[7]=2, d[8]=4, d[9]=1, d[10]=7,
d[11]=1, d[12]=2, d[13]=1, d[14]=4, d[15]=1, d[16]=4

Find the pattern! Think mathematically.
