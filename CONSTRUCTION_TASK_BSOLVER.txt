# TASK: EC Scalar Construction

## Goal
BUILD a ladder generator using Elliptic Curve scalar multiplication. The Bitcoin puzzle keys might be EC scalars with a pattern.

## Background
In EC cryptography, private keys are scalars. The public key is G * scalar where G is the generator point.

## Known Properties
- k_n = 2 * k_{n-1} + adj_n (recurrence)
- The keys grow roughly as O(2^n)
- Position in range varies: some keys are near minimum (k_4 at 0%), some near middle

## EC Construction Hypothesis

### Hypothesis 1: EC Point Addition Ladder
The keys might be derived from EC point operations:
- Start with base scalar s_0
- s_n = 2 * s_{n-1} + f(n) where f(n) involves EC operations

### Hypothesis 2: Scalar Ladder with EC Constraints
- adj_n might be derived from EC point coordinates
- m_n could relate to x-coordinates of specific points

### Hypothesis 3: Double-and-Add Pattern
The recurrence k_n = 2*k_{n-1} + adj_n looks like EC scalar multiplication's double-and-add:
- Double: 2*k_{n-1}
- Add: adj_n

Maybe the puzzle creator is implementing a specific EC scalar computation.

## Construction Approach
```python
def generate_ec_ladder(G, base_scalar, n_keys):
    """
    G: EC generator point
    base_scalar: starting scalar value
    """
    k = [0, base_scalar]
    
    for n in range(2, n_keys + 1):
        # Double previous
        doubled = 2 * k[n-1]
        
        # Compute adjustment from EC
        # This is the unknown function
        adj = ec_adjustment(G, k, n)
        
        k_n = doubled + adj
        k.append(k_n)
    
    return k

def ec_adjustment(G, k, n):
    """
    How to compute adj_n from EC?
    
    Options:
    1. adj_n = hash(n * G) mod 2^n
    2. adj_n = x-coord(k[d] * G) mod 2^n
    3. adj_n = f(y-coord of some point)
    """
    pass
```

## secp256k1 Parameters (Bitcoin curve)
p = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEFFFFFC2F
n = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141
G = (0x79BE667EF9DCBBAC55A06295CE870B07029BFCDB2DCE28D959F2815B16F81798,

## Key Questions
1. Is there an EC-based construction that produces the observed recurrence?
2. How would EC point operations produce the bounded m values?
3. What role does the curve order n play?

## Your Task
1. Propose an EC-based ladder generator
2. Explain how adj_n could derive from EC operations
3. Write pseudocode for verification
4. Suggest parameter search strategies

Think deeply. If this is EC-based, cracking it means understanding the creator's EC construction.
