TASK: Find the pattern in k-formula offsets

BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY:
For n ≡ 2 (mod 3), the k-sequence follows:
  k[n] = 9×k[n-3] + a×k[5] + b

where k[5] = 21 = 3×7 and the coefficients (a, b) are:

n=11: a=-41, b=0   → k[11] = 9×k[8] - 41×k[5]
n=14: a=7,   b=2   → k[14] = 9×k[11] + 7×k[5] + 2
n=17: a=44,  b=3   → k[17] = 9×k[14] + 44×k[5] + 3
n=20: a=43,  b=7   → k[20] = 9×k[17] + 43×k[5] + 7

ALL VERIFIED: These formulas give exact k-values!

OBSERVATIONS:
1. The coefficient 'a' differences are: 48, 37, -1
2. The coefficient 'b' values are: 0, 2, 3, 7 (Fibonacci-like?)
3. At n=23, the pattern EXPLODES (a = -103383)

QUESTIONS FOR THE LLM:
1. What mathematical pattern produces a = (-41, 7, 44, 43)?
2. Is there a recurrence for a[n] in terms of earlier values?
3. Why does the pattern explode at n=23?
4. Does this relate to the ++- sign pattern breaking at n=17?

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
- 9 = m[5] (from m-sequence)
- k[5] = 21 = k[2]×k[3] = 3×7
- 41 is prime (p[13])
- The pattern holds for n=11,14,17,20 (all ≡ 2 mod 3)

HINT: The differences 48, 37, -1 might encode something.
48 = 3×16 = 3×2^4
37 = prime (p[12])
-1 = ...

Think deeply about what mathematical structure produces these coefficients!
