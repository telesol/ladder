TASK: Prime Index Hypothesis for m[15], m[17], m[18], m[20]
MODEL: qwq:32b
TIMEOUT: 1 hour
DATE: 2025-12-19

CONTEXT:
We discovered that m[15], m[17], m[18], m[20] do NOT match any convergent patterns.

DATA:
m[15] = 26989 = 137 × 197
m[17] = 138269 = 37 × 37 × 101
m[18] = 255121 (PRIME)
m[20] = 900329 (PRIME)

OBSERVATIONS:
- 137 is the 33rd prime
- 197 is the 45th prime
- 37 is the 12th prime
- 101 is the 26th prime
- 255121 is prime
- 900329 is prime

QUESTIONS TO EXPLORE:
1. Is there a pattern in the prime INDICES (33, 45, 12, 26)?
2. Do 33, 45 relate to n=15? (33+12=45, 33-18=15?)
3. Is m[18] the (something)th prime? Which one?
4. Is m[20] the (something)th prime? Which one?
5. Are these primes related to Fibonacci indices?
6. Check: prime(33) = 137, prime(45) = 197. Is 33+45=78 or 45-33=12 significant?
7. For m[17] = 37² × 101: why squared? Is 37 the 12th prime relevant?

COMPUTE AND VERIFY:
- Find the prime index of 255121
- Find the prime index of 900329
- Check if these indices have patterns with n

OUTPUT:
Provide specific numerical findings. Show your calculations.
