To analyze the given position-in-range pattern and predict positions for specific \(k\)-values, let's break down the observations and derive a potential formula.

### Observations Recap

1. **Positions at multiples of 5 oscillate**:
   - \(k[70]\): Position = 64.4%
   - \(k[75]\): Position = 19.3%
   - \(k[80]\): Position = 82.9%
   - \(k[85]\): Position = 9.0%
   - \(k[90]\): Position = 40.2%

2. **Low positions (4, 10, 69) at specific \(n\) values**:
   - \(k[4]\): Position = 0.00%
   - \(k[10]\): Position = 0.39%
   - \(k[69]\): Position = 0.72%

3. **Gap puzzle positions show a pattern:**
   - 64.4, 19.3, 82.9, 9.0, 40.2

### Hypothesis Formulation

From the given data, we can hypothesize that there might be a periodic or oscillating function at work here. Let's consider a periodic function such as sine or cosine to model these oscillations.

Given the positions seem to follow a pattern, let's propose a function of the form:
\[ \text{Position}[n] = A + B \sin(C(n - D)) + E \]
where \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are constants to be determined based on the observed data.

### Step-by-Step Derivation

1. **Identify Key Points**:
   - For \(k[70]\): Position = 64.4%
   - For \(k[75]\): Position = 19.3%
   - For \(k[80]\): Position = 82.9%
   - For \(k[85]\): Position = 9.0%
   - For \(k[90]\): Position = 40.2%

2. **Fit to Sine Wave**:
   We can fit these points into a sine wave equation and solve for the constants.

3. **Initial Guesses**:
   - The amplitude (\(B\)) seems to be around 55%, as the range of positions is from about 9% to 82%.
   - The period might be related to multiples of 5 (70, 75, 80, 85).

Using these observations and fitting a sine wave through the points, we can get an approximate formula. However, for simplicity and given the limited data points, let's consider a simpler pattern.

### Simplified Pattern

Given the complexity, let's hypothesize a simplified pattern where positions follow a known sequence or pattern observed in the data.

From the gaps, it appears there might be a fixed increment or decrement between certain \(k\)-values. Given the specific values:

- \(k[70]\): Position = 64.4%
- \(k[75]\): Position = 19.3%
- \(k[80]\): Position = 82.9%
- \(k[85]\]: Position = 9.0%
- \(k[90]\): Position = 40.2%

We can see a pattern where positions at multiples of 5 seem to oscillate between high and low values.

### Predicting \(k[71]\)

Given the observed data, we can predict that the position for \(k[71]\) might be between the positions of \(k[70]\) and \(k[75]\).

- \(k[70]\): 64.4%
- \(k[75]\): 19.3%

A simple linear interpolation would give:
\[ \text{Position}[71] = \frac{(71 - 70)}{5} \times (19.3 - 64.4) + 64.4 \]
\[ \text{Position}[71] = \frac{1}{5} \times (-45.1) + 64.4 \]
\[ \text{Position}[71] = -9.02 + 64.4 \]
\[ \text{Position}[71] = 55.38\% \]

Thus, a predicted position for \(k[71]\) is approximately **55.38%**.

### Formula Derivation

Given the complexity and limited data points, a more precise formula might require fitting through all observed points with a sine wave or polynomial function. However, based on the observations:

\[ \text{Position}[n] = A + B \sin(C(n - D)) + E \]

Where \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are constants that can be fit using regression analysis.

For simplicity:
\[ \text{Position}[n] \approx 50 + 32.6 \sin(2\pi (n/10 - 4)) \]

This is an approximation based on the observed oscillations, but a more precise fit would require fitting through all given points using regression techniques.

### Conclusion

- **Mathematical Pattern**: Likely periodic or oscillating with specific multiples of \(n\).
- **Predicted Position for \(k[71]\)**: Approximately 55.38%.
- **Formula**: A more precise formula can be derived through regression analysis, but a simple approximation is provided above.
