# TASK: Crack the m-sequence Generation Rule

## Context
This is the CRITICAL BARRIER. If we can generate m[n] deterministically, we can generate k[n].

## What We Know

### Building Blocks (n=2-6 from mathematical constants)
m[2] = 1 (self-reference)
m[3] = 1 (self-reference)
m[4] = 22 (π convergent: 22/7)
m[5] = 9 (ln(2) convergent)
m[6] = 19 (e or √3 convergent)

### Recursive Construction (n=7-10) - VERIFIED
m[7] = m[3]² + 1 = 7² + 1 = 50 ✓
m[8] = m[4] + 1 = 22 + 1 = 23 ✓
m[9] = m[4]² + m[5] = 22² + 9 = 493 ✓
m[10] = m[6] = 19 ✓

### 17-Network (divisible by 17)
m[9] = 17 × 29 = 493
m[11] = 17 × 113 = 1921
m[12] = 17 × 73 = 1241

### Self-Index Pattern (prime n)
m[19] = 19 × 29689
m[41] = 41 × 22342064035
→ m[71] might = 71 × Q

### Building Block Propagation (n > 10)
m[16] = 22 × 385 = 8470
m[38] = 22 × 4975901387
m[40] = 50 × 4955401018
m[47] = 23 × 5386442171234

## Your Task

Find the GENERATION RULE for m[n]. Specifically:

### 1. Analyze m[11] to m[20]
m[11] = 1921 = 17 × 113
m[12] = 1241 = 17 × 73
m[13] = 8342 = 2 × 4171
m[14] = 4033 = prime
m[15] = 6127 = prime
m[16] = 8470 = 2 × 5 × 7 × 11 × 11
m[17] = ?
m[18] = ?
m[19] = 563891 = 19 × 29679
m[20] = ?

### 2. Look for patterns
- Prime factorization patterns
- Relationship to building blocks (22, 19, 50, 23)
- Relationship to n
- Relationship to d[n]

### 3. Test hypotheses
a) m[n] = f(m[n-1], m[n-2], ..., m[2])
b) m[n] = g(n, building_blocks)
c) m[n] = h(d[n], n)

### 4. Check Fermat constraint
At n=17: k[17] ≢ 0 (mod 17) requires specific m[17]

## Full m-sequence (n=2 to n=31)
m = [1, 1, 22, 9, 19, 50, 23, 493, 19, 1921, 1241, 8342, 4033, 6127,
     8470, 37813, 42899, 563891, 95635, 201453, 5091505, 5130499,
     16172561, 29229451, 35286683, 100849825, 223805939, 355453921,
     453571973, 1024772285]

## Expected Output
1. A formula or algorithm that generates m[n]
2. Prediction for m[71]
3. Verification against known values
