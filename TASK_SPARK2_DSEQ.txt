TASK FOR PHI4:14B - D-SEQUENCE FORMULA DISCOVERY

You are analyzing the d-sequence from the Bitcoin puzzle.

## The d-sequence (n=2 to n=35)

d[2]=2, d[3]=3, d[4]=1, d[5]=2, d[6]=2, d[7]=2, d[8]=4
d[9]=1, d[10]=7, d[11]=7, d[12]=5, d[13]=7, d[14]=8, d[15]=7
d[16]=4, d[17]=8, d[18]=7, d[19]=5, d[20]=15, d[21]=8, d[22]=17
d[23]=7, d[24]=7, d[25]=8, d[26]=4, d[27]=8, d[28]=5, d[29]=8
d[30]=23, d[31]=8, d[32]=15, d[33]=8, d[34]=7, d[35]=18

## Context

The master formula is: k_n = 2 × k_{n-1} + adj_n
where adj_n = 2^n - m_n × k_{d_n}

So d_n determines WHICH previous k value to use in computing adj_n.

## Observations

1. d[n] is always between 1 and n-1
2. d[n] often equals n-1 or is much smaller
3. Values like 7 and 8 appear frequently
4. d[20]=15, d[30]=23, d[35]=18 seem to follow some pattern

## Your Task

1. List all unique d values and their frequencies
2. Look for patterns:
   - Is d[n] related to the binary representation of n?
   - Is d[n] related to prime factorization of n?
   - Is d[n] related to previous d values?
3. Find any formula that generates d[2] through d[35]
4. Predict d[36], d[37], d[38]

Show your reasoning step by step.
