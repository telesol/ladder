# TASK: Deep Dive into Mathematical Constants

## What We Know
- m[2,3,4] = 3, 7, 22 from π convergents (3/1, 22/7)
- m[5] = 9 = digit_sum(333) where 333 is π convergent numerator
- m[6] = 19 from e convergent (19/7)
- m[7]/m[6] = 50/19 ≈ 2.63 (close to e=2.718)

## The Sequences (n=2 to 31):
m: 3, 7, 22, 9, 19, 50, 23, 493, 19, 1921, 1241, 8342, 2034, 26989, 8470, 138269, 255121, 564091, 900329, 670674
d: 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 7, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2

## Your 2-Hour Task

1. Explore MORE mathematical constants:
   - Golden ratio φ = 1.618... convergents: 1/1, 2/1, 3/2, 5/3, 8/5, 13/8...
   - √2 convergents: 1/1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29...
   - √3 convergents
   - ln(2) convergents

2. For each unexplained m[n], check if it appears in:
   - m[8] = 23: Is this from any convergent? (23 is prime)
   - m[9] = 493 = 17×29: Do 17 or 29 appear in constants?
   - m[11] = 1921 = 19×101: Significance?
   - m[12] = 1241 = prime: Any constant connection?

3. Look for convergent COMBINATIONS:
   - Could m[n] = numerator[i] + denominator[j]?
   - Could m[n] = numerator[i] × denominator[j] mod something?
   - Could m[n] = digit manipulation of multiple convergents?

4. Bitcoin/secp256k1 specific:
   - secp256k1 prime p = 2^256 - 2^32 - 977
   - Generator point G coordinates
   - Order n of the curve
   - Do any m values relate to these?

5. Propose a unified theory:
   - How does the sequence transition from π to e?
   - Is there a third constant involved (φ, √2, etc.)?
   - What determines when to use which constant?

Find the complete constant-based generation rule!
