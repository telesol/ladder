TASK: Find the pattern in k-formula coefficients

CONTEXT:
The k-values are built from linear combinations k[n] = a×k[i] + b×k[j] + c.
The coefficients a, b come from specific sources.

OBSERVED COEFFICIENT PATTERNS:
n=7:  coefficient 9 = m[5] (m-sequence value!)
n=8:  coefficient 32 = 2^5 (power of 2!)
n=11: coefficient 19 = m[6] = m[10] (m-sequence value!)
n=12: coefficient 12 = n itself!
n=14: coefficient 16 = 2^4 (power of 2!)
n=15: coefficient 37 = prime
n=16: coefficient 45 = 9×5 = m[5]×5 (m-value × 5!)

QUESTIONS:
1. What determines when to use an m-sequence value as coefficient?
2. What determines when to use a power of 2?
3. What determines when to use n itself?
4. Is there a meta-rule that tells us which source to use?

ADDITIONAL DATA:
- n=7: uses m[5]=9 (and n-2 = 5)
- n=11: uses m[6]=19 (and n-5 = 6)
- n=12: uses n=12 itself
- n=16: uses m[5]×5 = 45

HYPOTHESIS TO TEST:
- When n ≡ 0 (mod 3), use m[n/something]?
- When n is prime, use power of 2?
- When d[n] = 4, use power of 2?

Think step by step and find the pattern!
