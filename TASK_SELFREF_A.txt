TASK: Find Self-Referential Formulas for m[13], m[14], m[15], m[16]
MODEL: qwq:32b
TIMEOUT: 45 minutes
DATE: 2025-12-19

CONTEXT - VERIFIED PATTERNS:
We discovered the m-sequence uses EARLIER m-values:
  m[9]  = p[7] × p[10]    where 7=n-2, 10=n+1
  m[11] = p[7] × p[30]    where 7=n-4, 30=n+m[6]=11+19
  m[12] = p[7] × p[21]    where 7=n-5, 21=n+m[5]=12+9
  m[18] = prime(m[7] × p[87]) = prime(50 × 449)

NOTATION:
  p[k] = the k-th prime (p[1]=2, p[7]=17, p[10]=29, etc.)
  m[k] = known m-sequence value

KNOWN M-VALUES:
  m[2]=3, m[3]=7, m[4]=22, m[5]=9, m[6]=19, m[7]=50
  m[8]=23, m[9]=493, m[10]=19, m[11]=1921, m[12]=1241

YOUR TASK - Find formulas for:

1. m[13] = 8342
   Factorization: 8342 = 2 × 43 × 97
   Prime indices: 43=p[14], 97=p[25]
   Question: Is 14 = 13 + m[?] or 25 = 13 + m[?]?
   Check: 25 - 13 = 12 = m[?] No, but check other combinations

2. m[14] = 2034
   Factorization: 2034 = 2 × 3 × 339 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 113 = 2 × 9 × 113
   Note: 113 = p[30]
   Question: Is 30 = 14 + m[?]? Check: 30 - 14 = 16. Is m[k]=16 for some k?
   Or: Is 2034 = p[a] × p[b] × p[c] with self-reference?

3. m[15] = 26989
   Factorization: 26989 = 137 × 197 = p[33] × p[45]
   Known: 33 = 15 + 18, 45 = 15 × 3
   Question: Is 18 = m[?]? No direct match.
   Check: Is 45 = 15 + m[?]? 45-15=30. Is 30 related to m[k]?

4. m[16] = 8470
   Factorization: 8470 = 2 × 5 × 7 × 121 = 2 × 5 × 7 × 11²
   Prime indices: 2=p[1], 5=p[3], 7=p[4], 11=p[5]
   Question: Is there a pattern like p[1]×p[3]×p[4]×p[5]²?
   Note: 1+3+4+5+5 = 18, and 18 - 16 = 2. Is m[?]=2? No.

STRATEGY:
For each m[n], try:
  - m[n] = p[n-k] × p[n+m[j]] for k=1..8, j=2..n-1
  - m[n] = p[n-k]² × p[n+m[j]] (squared variant)
  - m[n] = prime(m[j] × p[i]) (prime-index variant)
  - m[n] = p[a] × p[b] × p[c] where a+b+c relates to n and m[k]

OUTPUT:
For each m[n], provide:
1. The formula if found
2. Verification that formula gives correct value
3. If no formula found, list what you tried
