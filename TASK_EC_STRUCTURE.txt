TASK: Find elliptic curve structure in the k-sequence

HYPOTHESIS: Keys are derived from EC point operations on secp256k1.

KNOWN:
- Bitcoin uses secp256k1: y² = x³ + 7 (mod p)
- Generator point G has order n ≈ 2²⁵⁶
- Private key k → Public key kG

OBSERVATION 1: k-values follow recurrence
k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + adj[n]

This is similar to point doubling!
- Point doubling: 2P = P + P
- Our recurrence: k[n] ≈ 2*k[n-1] + correction

OBSERVATION 2: Clean EC-style formulas exist
k7 = 4*k5 - k4   (like aP + bQ)
k8 = 5*k6 - k5
k11 = 5*k3 + 5*k8

OBSERVATION 3: Powers of 2 appear
k4 = 2³ × k1 = 8
k8 = 2⁵ × k3 = 224

QUESTION:
Are the k-values derived from EC scalar operations?

Test:
- k[n] = scalar(n) × G for some scalar function
- k[n] = k[n-1] + k[f(n)] (point addition analog)
- The m-values are corrections for "carrying" in EC operations

Find the EC interpretation that generates k[71].
