TASK B: THE BREAK POINT (n=17 exactly)
================================================================================
Agent: Spark1 (qwq:32b)
Goal: Understand EXACTLY what changes at n=17 and WHY
Time: Deep reasoning allowed (60+ minutes)

================================================================================
CONTEXT
================================================================================

The Bitcoin puzzle has a CRITICAL transition at n=17:

BEFORE (n=2-16): Sign pattern ++- works PERFECTLY (15/15 = 100%)
AT n=17: Pattern BREAKS (expected +, actual -)
AFTER: Pattern partially recovers but not fully

This is THE inflection point. Understanding it may reveal the entire algorithm.

================================================================================
THE BREAK IN DETAIL
================================================================================

n=16 (last "normal" value):
- k[16] = 51510 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 17 × 101
- adj[16] = -2224 (sign = -, matches ++- pattern)
- m[16] = 8470
- d[16] = 4

n=17 (THE BREAK):
- k[17] = 95823 = 3^4 × 7 × 13^2 = 81 × 7 × 169
- adj[17] = k[17] - 2*k[16] = 95823 - 103020 = -7197
- Expected sign: + (pattern would be ++-)
- Actual sign: - (BREAK!)
- m[17] = 138269
- d[17] = 1

n=18 (after break):
- k[18] = 198669 = 3 × 47 × 1409
- adj[18] = 7023 (sign = +, matches pattern again!)

================================================================================
WHAT IF PATTERN CONTINUED?
================================================================================

If n=17 followed ++- pattern:
- adj[17] would be POSITIVE
- k[17] would be = 2*k[16] + |adj[17]| = 103020 + X

But actual:
- adj[17] = -7197 (NEGATIVE)
- k[17] = 103020 - 7197 = 95823

The difference: adj[17] flipped sign from expected + to actual -

================================================================================
QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
================================================================================

1. WHY DID THE SIGN FLIP?
   - What constraint forced adj[17] to be negative?
   - Did a mathematical constraint override the pattern?
   - Is there a ceiling/floor that k[17] couldn't exceed?

2. IS 17 SPECIAL?
   - 17 = 2^4 + 1 (Fermat prime F₂)
   - 17 appears in k[16] = 2×3×5×17×101
   - Is the break related to 17 being special?

3. IS IT BIT-LENGTH RELATED?
   - k[17].bit_length() = 17 bits
   - k[16].bit_length() = 16 bits
   - Does something happen when bit_length equals n?

4. THE STRUCTURE OF k[17]:
   - k[17] = 3^4 × 7 × 13^2 = 81 × 7 × 169
   - This is HIGHLY structured (only primes 3, 7, 13)
   - Compare: k[16] = 2×3×5×17×101 (more diverse primes)
   - Was k[17] CHOSEN for this structure?

5. M[17] ANALYSIS:
   - m[17] = 138269
   - Factorization: 138269 = ?
   - Is this a convergent combination?
   - Does it follow a new pattern?

6. COULD THE PATTERN HAVE CONTINUED?
   - If adj[17] was positive, what would k[17] be?
   - Would that k[17] violate some constraint?
   - What is the constraint?

================================================================================
HYPOTHESES TO TEST
================================================================================

H1: OVERFLOW HYPOTHESIS
    - Some internal state overflowed at n=17
    - The algorithm had to "reset" or "adjust"

H2: CONSTRAINT HYPOTHESIS
    - k[17] had to satisfy some constraint (divisibility, range, etc.)
    - The only way to satisfy it was with negative adj

H3: PRNG STATE CHANGE
    - A PRNG generating the pattern changed state at n=17
    - The seed or parameters changed

H4: DELIBERATE MARKER
    - The creator intentionally broke the pattern at n=17
    - 17 is a marker or "signature"

H5: PHASE TRANSITION
    - n=2-16 is "Phase 1" of the algorithm
    - n=17+ is "Phase 2" with different rules

================================================================================
DATA TO ANALYZE
================================================================================

Full sequence around n=17:

n  | k[n]     | adj[n]  | sign | expected | m[n]    | d[n]
---|----------|---------|------|----------|---------|-----
14 | 10544    | 112     | +    | +        | 2034    | 4
15 | 26867    | 5779    | +    | +        | 26989   | 1
16 | 51510    | -2224   | -    | -        | 8470    | 4
17 | 95823    | -7197   | -    | + ← BREAK| 138269  | 1
18 | 198669   | 7023    | +    | +        | 255121  | 1
19 | 357535   | -39803  | -    | -        | 564091  | 1
20 | 863317   | 148247  | +    | +        | 900329  | 1

Note: n=18-20 matches the pattern again! Only n=17 breaks it.

================================================================================
OUTPUT FORMAT
================================================================================

Provide:
1. Your analysis of WHY the sign flipped at n=17
2. What constraint (if any) forced this
3. Whether 17 being a Fermat prime is relevant
4. Whether bit-length == n is relevant
5. What the k[17] structure (3^4 × 7 × 13^2) tells us
6. Your best hypothesis for the transition mechanism

Think deeply. This is the KEY to the puzzle.
