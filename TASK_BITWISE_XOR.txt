# TASK: Explore XOR and Bitwise Patterns

## Background
Previous analysis suggested trying XOR and bitwise operations to find patterns.

## The Sequences (n=2 to 21):
m: 3, 7, 22, 9, 19, 50, 23, 493, 19, 1921, 1241, 8342, 2034, 26989, 8470, 138269, 255121, 564091, 900329, 670674
d: 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 7, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2

## Binary representations:
m[2]=3    = 11
m[3]=7    = 111
m[4]=22   = 10110
m[5]=9    = 1001
m[6]=19   = 10011
m[7]=50   = 110010
m[8]=23   = 10111
m[9]=493  = 111101101
m[10]=19  = 10011
m[11]=1921= 11110000001

## Your 2-Hour Task

1. XOR patterns:
   - Does m[n] XOR m[n-1] reveal a pattern?
   - Does m[n] XOR 2^n reveal anything?
   - Does m[n] XOR n reveal anything?

2. Bit manipulation:
   - Count of 1-bits in m[n] - any pattern?
   - Position of highest set bit - relationship to d?
   - Does bit-reversal of any m[n] relate to another m[k]?

3. Binary string patterns:
   - Do the binary strings share common substrings?
   - Is there a shift-register relationship?

4. XOR with constants:
   - Try XOR with π digits in binary
   - Try XOR with e digits in binary
   - Try XOR with secp256k1 constants

5. Construct a bitwise formula:
   - Can m[n] = (some XOR operation) on previous values?
   - Can m[n] = shift operation on π/e convergent?

Find ANY bitwise relationship that holds for multiple values!
