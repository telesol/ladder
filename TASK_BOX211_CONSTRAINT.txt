TASK: Solve the constraint system for k[71]

DERIVED EQUATIONS (100% verified):
k[71] = 4,302,057,189,444,869,987,810 - m[71]*k[d[71]]
k[72] = 13,326,480,861,759,385,189,316 - 2*m[71]*k[d[71]] - m[72]*k[d[72]]

CONSTRAINT FROM k[75]:
9*offset[72] + offset[75] = -1,540,910,604,560,624,546,757

WHERE:
offset[72] = 10,651,010,434,476,002,037,080 - 2*m[71]*k[d[71]] - m[72]*k[d[72]]
offset[75] = 3*2^75 - k[72] - (4*m[73]*k[d[73]] + 2*m[74]*k[d[74]] + m[75]*k[d[75]])

RANGE CONSTRAINT:
1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424 <= k[71] < 2,361,183,241,434,822,606,847

QUESTION:
Can we solve for m[71], d[71] given these constraints?
- We have 1 equation, multiple unknowns
- But m[n] has a generation rule (unknown)
- And d[n] minimizes m[n]

Approach: For each candidate d[71] ∈ {1,2,...,10}:
  Compute valid m[71] range
  Check if any (m[71], d[71]) satisfies all constraints
