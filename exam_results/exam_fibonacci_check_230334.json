  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is asking if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence, which is usually something like k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2}. They've given me two equations based on the terms k7 = 76 and k8 = 224. The first equation is 76 = 49a + 21b, and the second is 224 = 76a + 49b. I need to solve these equations to see if there are integer values of a and b that satisfy both. If there are, then the recurrence holds with those coefficients. \n\nFirst, let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:\n\n1) 49a + 21b = 76  \n2) 76a + 49b = 224  \n\nHmm, okay. Let me try solving this system of equations. Since both equations have two variables, a and b, I can use either substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is better here because the coefficients are a bit messy. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let me label the equations for clarity:\n\nEquation (1): 49a + 21b = 76  \nEquation (2): 76a + 49b = 224  \n\nI need to eliminate one of the variables. Let's try to eliminate 'a' first. To do that, I can multiply equation (1) by 76 and equation (2) by 49 so that the coefficients of 'a' will be the same, then subtract them. Wait, that might get too big, but let's try.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to solve for one variable in terms of the other from equation (1) and substitute into equation (2). Let's try substitution.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\n49a + 21b = 76  \nLet me solve for a:\n\n49a = 76 - 21b  \na = (76 - 21b)/49  \n\nHmm, that might be a bit messy, but let's plug this expression for a into equation (2):\n\n76a + 49b = 224  \nSubstitute a:\n\n76*( (76 - 21b)/49 ) + 49b = 224  \n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, compute the first term:\n\n76*(76 - 21b)/49  \nLet me compute 76 divided by 49 first. 76/49 is approximately 1.551, but let's keep it as a fraction: 76/49. So,\n\n76*(76 - 21b)/49 = (76*76 - 76*21b)/49  \nCalculate 76*76: 5776  \n76*21 = 1596  \nSo, numerator is 5776 - 1596b  \nTherefore, the first term is (5776 - 1596b)/49  \n\nAdding the second term, which is 49b:\n\nSo overall equation becomes:\n\n(5776 - 1596b)/49 + 49b = 224  \n\nLet me combine terms. Let me write 49b as (49b * 49)/49 to have the same denominator. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, multiply both sides by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\nMultiply all terms by 49:\n\n5776 - 1596b + 49*49b = 224*49  \n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: 5776 - 1596b + (49^2)b  \n49^2 is 2401, so 2401b  \nSo left side: 5776 + (2401b - 1596b)  \n2401 - 1596 = 805, so 805b.  \nTherefore, left side: 5776 + 805b  \n\nRight side: 224*49  \nLet me compute that: 224*50 would be 11200, minus 224 gives 11200 - 224 = 10976  \n\nSo now equation is:\n\n5776 + 805b = 10976  \n\nSubtract 5776 from both sides:\n\n805b = 10976 - 5776  \nCalculate 10976 - 5776: 5200  \n\nThus, 805b = 5200  \nTherefore, b = 5200 / 805  \n\nSimplify this fraction. Let's see if 5 divides both:\n\n5200 \u00f7 5 = 1040  \n805 \u00f7 5 = 161  \n\nSo, 1040/161. Hmm, can this be simplified further? Let me check if 161 divides into 1040. \n\n161*6 = 966, 1040 - 966 = 74.  \n161 and 74 have a GCD of... 74 factors are 2 and 37. 161 is 7*23. So no common factors. So the fraction reduces to 1040/161 \u2248 6.46...\n\nHmm, that's a decimal, not an integer. Since we were supposed to find integer a and b, this might be a problem. Maybe I made a calculation error? Let me check the steps again.\n\nStarting from substitution:\n\nFrom equation (1): a = (76 -21b)/49\n\nSubstituted into equation (2):\n\n76a +49b =224  \n76*(76 -21b)/49 +49b =224\n\nYes, that's right. Then expanding:\n\n76*76 = 5776, 76*21=1596, so numerator is 5776 - 1596b. Divided by 49, then plus 49b.\n\nMultiply both sides by 49:\n\n5776 -1596b + 49*49b =224*49\n\nWait, 49*49b is 2401b. So total b terms: -1596b +2401b = 805b. That seems correct.\n\nThen 5776 +805b = 10976. Subtract 5776: 805b = 5200. 5200 divided by 805: yes, 5200/805 = 5200 \u00f7 5 \u00f7 161 = 1040/161 \u22486.46. Hmm.\n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me check 224*49 again. 224*50 is 11200, minus 224 is 11200 -224 = 10976. That's correct. 10976 -5776: 10976 -5000 = 5976, minus 776 more is 5200. Correct.\n\nHmm, so that suggests that b is 5200/805, which is not an integer. Since the problem says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" then unless I made a mistake in the problem setup, maybe there are no integer solutions. But the problem mentions \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\" so maybe the recurrence isn't homogeneous? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the problem. Let me check the given terms again. The user says \"For k7=76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\" and \"For k8=224: 224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\". So that assumes that k6 is 21 and k5 is something? Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem states \"FIBONACCI-LIKE RECURRENCE CHECK\" so perhaps the terms before are needed? Wait, the problem as presented here just gives equations for k7 and k8 in terms of previous terms. Let me confirm:\n\nThe problem says \"For k7 = 76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\" so that implies that k6 is 49 and k5 is 21? Because in a Fibonacci-like recurrence, to get k7 you need k6 and k5. Similarly, for k8 you need k7 and k6. So yes, so if k6 is 49 and k5 is 21, then the equations make sense. However, if that's the case, then the recurrence is supposed to be k_n = a*k_{n-1} +b*k_{n-2}. So the equations are correct as given. But solving them gives non-integer a and b, so perhaps there is no such recurrence with integer coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the previous terms are different? Wait, maybe the user has a different sequence, but since they just provided the two equations, maybe it's okay. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider fractions? But the question specifically asks for integer a and b.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I need to check my algebra again. Let me try solving the equations again using a different method. Let's try elimination instead of substitution.\n\nWe have:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b =76  \nEquation2:76a +49b =224  \n\nLet me try to eliminate 'b'. To do that, I can multiply equation1 by 49 and equation2 by 21 so that the coefficients of b become 21*49 and 49*21, which are the same. Then subtract the equations.\n\nSo:\n\nMultiply equation1 by 49:  \n49*(49a) +49*(21b) =49*76  \nWhich is 2401a + 1029b = 3724  \n\nMultiply equation2 by21:  \n21*(76a) +21*(49b) =21*224  \nWhich is 1596a + 1029b = 4704  \n\nNow subtract the first new equation from the second new equation:\n\n(1596a + 1029b) - (2401a + 1029b) = 4704 - 3724  \nSimplify left side: (1596a -2401a) + (1029b -1029b) = -805a  \nRight side: 980  \n\nTherefore: -805a = 980  \nThus, a = -980 /805  \n\nSimplify this fraction. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n-980 \u00f75 = -196  \n805 \u00f75 =161  \n\nSo a = -196/161. Hmm, that's also a fraction. So again, not an integer. So that would confirm that there are no integer solutions for a and b. \n\nHmm, so that suggests that with the given equations, there are no integers a and b that satisfy both equations. Therefore, the sequence does not follow a linear recurrence of the form k_n = a*k_{n-1} +b*k_{n-2} with integer coefficients. \n\nBut the problem also says \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\". So maybe there is a constant term c that allows integer coefficients? Let's try that. \n\nSo now, the recurrence would be k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2} + c. Let's see if there are integers a, b, c such that this holds. \n\nGiven that k7=76, which is equal to a*k6 + b*k5 + c. Since k6 is 49 and k5 is21, so:\n\n76 = a*49 + b*21 +c  \nSimilarly, k8=224 =a*76 + b*49 +c  \n\nWe now have two equations with three variables. To have a solution, we might need another equation. But perhaps we can find integers a, b, c that satisfy these two equations. Let's see.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\n1)49a +21b + c =76  \n2)76a +49b +c =224  \n\nLet me subtract equation1 from equation2 to eliminate c:\n\n(76a +49b +c) - (49a +21b +c) =224 -76  \nSimplify left side: (76a -49a) + (49b -21b) + (c -c)  \n=27a +28b =148  \n\nSo, 27a +28b =148. Now, this is one equation with two variables. Let me see if there are integer solutions here. \n\nLet me try to express a in terms of b or vice versa. Let's say:\n\n27a =148 -28b  \na = (148 -28b)/27  \n\nHmm, need a to be integer, so (148 -28b) must be divisible by27. Let's see possible integer values for b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try to find integers b such that 148 -28b is divisible by27. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for small integer values. Let me try some numbers.\n\nStart by solving 27a +28b =148.\n\nLet me see if I can find integers a and b. Let's rearrange:\n\nLet me try to find a solution where a and b are integers. Let me try expressing in terms of modulo.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation modulo 27:\n\n28b \u2261148 mod27\n\nFirst compute 28 mod27 =1, since 27*1=27, so 28-27=1.\n\nSimilarly 148 mod27: 27*5=135, so 148-135=13. So equation becomes:\n\n1*b \u226113 mod27  \nThus, b \u226113 mod27. So possible solutions for b are 13 +27k, where k is integer. But since we might want small numbers, let's try b=13, then a=(148-28*13)/27\n\nCompute 28*13=364. 148-364= -216. So a= -216/27= -8. \n\nSo a= -8, b=13. Let's check if that works in equation 27a +28b=27*(-8)+28*13= -216 + 364=148. Yes, that works. \n\nSo one solution is a=-8, b=13. \n\nThen, let's find c from equation1: 49a +21b +c =76. Plugging in a=-8 and b=13:\n\n49*(-8) +21*13 +c =76  \nCompute 49*(-8)= -392  \n21*13=273  \nSo total: -392 +273 +c =76  \n-392 +273 = -119  \nThus, -119 +c =76  \nTherefore, c=76 +119=195  \n\nSo c=195. Let me check with equation2 as well:\n\n76a +49b +c =76*(-8)+49*13 +195  \nCalculate each term:  \n76*(-8)= -608  \n49*13=637  \nSo total: -608 +637 +195 = (-608 +637)=29, 29+195=224. Perfect, that matches.\n\nSo the coefficients would be a=-8, b=13, c=195. These are integers. \n\nTherefore, the recurrence relation would be k_n = -8*k_{n-1} +13*k_{n-2} +195. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that this is the only solution? Since there are infinitely many solutions unless we fix another equation. But since we only have two equations, we can have multiple solutions depending on the value of k chosen. But the problem just asks if such integers exist, which they do. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that there is no linear recurrence without the constant term (with integer coefficients), but with a constant term there is. Since the problem mentions \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\", so we should present this solution. \n\nBut the problem says \"FIBONACCI-LIKE RECURRENCE CHECK\" but Fibonacci-like usually refers to linear recursions without constant terms. However, since the user says \"Also try\", then the answer would be that the sequence follows the recurrence k_n = -8*k_{n-1} +13*k_{n-2} +195. \n\nHowever, perhaps there's a better solution with smaller coefficients? Let me see if there are other integer solutions for a and b. \n\nThe general solution for the equation 27a +28b=148 is given by:\n\nSince one particular solution is a=-8, b=13, the general solution can be written as:\n\na = -8 +28k  \nb=13 -27k  \n\nfor some integer k. Because the coefficients 27 and28 are coprime (gcd is1), so the solutions are of this form. \n\nLet me try k=1:\n\na= -8 +28=20  \nb=13-27= -14  \n\nThen check:\n\n27*20 +28*(-14)= 540 -392=148. Yes. \n\nThen c from equation1:49a +21b +c=76  \n49*20 +21*(-14) +c= 980 -294 +c =686 +c =76 \u2192 c=76-686= -610. \n\nSo another solution is a=20, b=-14, c=-610. \n\nAlternatively k=2:\n\na= -8+56=48  \nb=13-54= -41  \nThen c=49*48 +21*(-41)+c= 2352 -861 +c=1491 +c=76 \u2192c= -1415. \n\nAlternatively, k=0 gives the first solution. \n\nSo depending on k, you can have different coefficients. Since the problem says \"Also try\", perhaps the user wants the minimal coefficients or the one with the constant term. Since they don't specify, but given that the first solution with a=-8, b=13, c=195 is the first one, that might be the answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to consider the possibility of a constant term and present that solution. So the answer is that the recurrence is possible with constants a=-8, b=13, and c=195. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation? Let me check again with a=-8, b=13, c=195:\n\nTesting the recurrence for k7=76:\n\nk7 should be equal to -8*k6 +13*k5 +195. \n\nGiven that k6=49 and k5=21:\n\n-8*(49) +13*(21) +195 = -392 + 273 +195 = (-392 + 273)= -119 +195=76. Correct. \n\nSimilarly for k8=224:\n\n-8*k7 +13*k6 +195 = -8*(76) +13*49 +195= -608 +637 +195= ( -608+637)=29 +195=224. Correct. \n\nSo that works. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the sequence does follow a linear recurrence relation of the form k_n = a*k_{n-1} +b*k_{n-2} +c with integers a= -8, b=13, c=195. \n\nHowever, since the problem initially asked for a Fibonacci-like recurrence (without constant term) and then suggested to try with a constant term, the answer is that there is no such recurrence without a constant term, but there is one with. Since the user might need to present the answer as per the question's requirement, but the way the problem is phrased is a bit ambiguous. The user might be expecting to check if there is a Fibonacci-like recurrence (without constant term), which there isn't, but since they added the \"Also try\" part, so the answer includes the constant term. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed something? Let me check once again the initial equations. \n\nThe problem states:\n\n\"For k7 = 76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\" which implies the recurrence is supposed to be without the constant term, so that would require a and b to satisfy 49a +21b =76 and 76a +49b=224. \n\nBut since there is no solution in integers, as shown earlier, then the answer to the first part (without constant term) is no. However, since the user says \"Also try\", then the answer with the constant term is possible. \n\nGiven that the problem says \"FIBONACCI-LIKE RECURRENCE CHECK\" but then also suggests adding a constant term, perhaps the user is okay with that. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is that the recurrence is possible with coefficients a=-8, b=13, and c=195. But since the problem might want the answer in boxed form, probably for the constant term version. But the question is a bit ambiguous. Since the user hasn't specified, but given the initial equations, perhaps they need to state that there is no solution without constant term, but with constant term, the solution is as above. \n\nBut since the problem is in the imperative \"CHECK\", maybe they just need to say whether it's possible. Given that with a constant term it is possible, so the answer is yes, and the recurrence is as above. Since they might need to present the coefficients, but maybe the question is expecting just the existence. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a miscalculation. Let me see another way. Let me try small numbers for a and b. Suppose a and b are integers such that 27a +28b=148. Let me see if there is a solution where a and b are smaller.\n\nLet me try b= 148 mod27. Let me see another approach. Let me try to find integer solutions. Let me write 27a =148-28b. So 148 -28b must be divisible by27. Let me try b=13 gives 148-28*13=148-364= -216, which is divisible by27 ( -216/27= -8). \n\nAlternatively, b= -4 gives 148 -28*(-4)=148+112=260. 260 divided by27 is about 9.63, not integer. \n\nb= 5: 148-140=8 \u21928/27 not integer. \n\nb=4:148 -112=36 \u219236/27=4/3 not integer. \n\nb= 10:148-280= -132 \u2192-132/27= -4.888\u2026 nope. \n\nb= -1:148+28=176 \u2192176/27\u22486.5\u2026 \n\nSo the only integer solution is b=13 and a= -8. \n\nThus, the only solution with the minimal absolute values is a=-8, b=13. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the recurrence relation with constant term is possible with a=-8, b=13, and c=195. \n\nSince the problem might need the answer in boxed form, perhaps the coefficients, but given the way the question is phrased, maybe they just want to confirm that it can be done with a constant term, so the existence is the key point. But since the user included \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", perhaps they want the coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in Chinese and the translation is \"Fibonacci-like recurrence check\", so maybe the user just wants to know if it is possible with integer coefficients, so the answer is no for the Fibonacci-like (without constant term), but yes with the constant term. Since the question is a bit ambiguous. \n\nGiven that the problem provides the equations for k7 and k8 in terms of previous terms, and asks to check the Fibonacci-like (linear recurrence of order 2 without constant term), but since there is no solution, but with constant term there is. So the answer is that it is possible with a constant term, so the final answer would be the coefficients. Since the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", maybe they want the coefficients in a box. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the user to recognize that there is no solution without a constant term. Since the initial question is \"FIBONACCI-LIKE RECURRENCE CHECK\" which usually doesn't have constant terms. Therefore, the answer would be that there is no such recurrence, but since the user says \"Also try\", then the answer is that there is a recurrence with constant term. \n\nHowever, given the problem's exact wording, since it says \"FIBONACCI-LIKE\" which is typically a linear recurrence without constant term, the correct answer is that there is no such recurrence, but with a constant term it exists. Since the problem might be expecting to state that it's not possible, but with the constant term it is. Since the user might need to write the coefficients in boxed notation, perhaps the triplet a, b, c. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo or miscalculation. Let me check again the equations without constant term:\n\n49a +21b =76  \n76a +49b =224  \n\nLet me solve this system:\n\nMultiply first equation by 76: 49*76 a +21*76 b =76*76  \nMultiply second equation by49:76*49 a +49*49 b=224*49  \n\nSubtract first multiplied equation from second: \n\n(76*49a +49\u00b2b) - (49*76a +21*76b)=224*49 -76\u00b2\n\nThe a terms cancel:\n\n49\u00b2b -21*76b =224*49 -76\u00b2  \nb(49\u00b2 -21*76)=224*49 -76\u00b2\n\nCompute left side:\n\n49\u00b2=2401  \n21*76=1596  \n2401-1596=805\n\nRight side:\n\n224*49=10976  \n76\u00b2=5776  \n10976-5776=5200\n\nSo 805b=5200 \u2192 b=5200/805= divide numerator and denominator by 5: 1040/161. Which is not integer. So no solution. \n\nTherefore, there is no solution without constant term. Hence the answer is that it is not possible without constant term, but possible with, so the answer is that it follows the recurrence with a=-8, b=13, c=195. \n\nSince the user might need to present this as boxed, perhaps each coefficient boxed? Or the entire equation? \n\nSince the problem might be expecting the user to answer that it is not a Fibonacci-like recurrence (no solution without constant term), so the answer is no. But since the user says \"Also try\", then the answer includes the constant term. \n\nThe problem is a bit ambiguous, but given the instructions, I think the user wants the coefficients for the recurrence with constant term. So the answer is a=-8, b=13, c=195. Since they might want them boxed separately or as an equation. \n\nPerhaps the standard way is to write the recurrence equation:\n\nk_n = -8k_{n-1} +13k_{n-2} +195\n\nBut how to box this? Maybe box each coefficient?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects only the existence, so the final answer is \"Yes\" with a constant term, but since it's math, perhaps the coefficients in a boxed triplet:\n\n\\boxed{a=-8}, \\boxed{b=13}, \\boxed{c=195}\n\nBut instructions say \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", so maybe all together:\n\n\\boxed{-8}, \\boxed{13}, \\boxed{195}\n\nBut not sure. Alternatively, present the equation boxed:\n\n\\boxed{k_n = -8k_{n-1} + 13k_{n-2} + 195}\n\nThis is more informative. Since the user might expect that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from an exam where the answer is the coefficients a, b, c, so boxed as a triplet: \\boxed{(-8, 13, 195)}. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following standard practices, I think writing the recurrence equation boxed is better.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sequence follows the recurrence relation \\boxed{k_n = -8k_{n-1} + 13k_{n-2} + 195}.\n",
