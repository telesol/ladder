  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence relation, which is k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}. The problem has given me the terms k7 = 76 and k8 = 224, and also mentions that we can predict future terms like k15 and k16 if such a recurrence exists. Hmm, let me start by trying to solve for a and b using the two equations provided.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:\n\nFor k7 = 76:\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = 76a + 49b\n\nSo, we have a system of two equations with two variables, a and b. The question is whether there exist integer solutions for a and b here. If they are integers, then maybe the recurrence works; otherwise, maybe it's a different kind of recurrence with a constant term, like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c. The problem also suggests trying that. Let's first tackle the first case without the constant term.\n\nSo starting with the two equations:\n\n1) 49a + 21b = 76\n\n2) 76a + 49b = 224\n\nHmm, solving this system. Since these are linear equations, maybe we can use substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination. Let's see:\n\nFirst, maybe multiply the first equation by 49 and the second equation by 21, so that the coefficients of b will be the same? Wait, let me see:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps make the coefficients of a or b the same. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\n49a + 21b = 76 --> let's divide all terms by 7 to simplify.\n\n49 divided by 7 is 7, 21 divided by 7 is 3, 76 divided by 7 is approximately 10.857, but that might not help. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe not simplifying yet.\n\nAlternatively, let's write it in terms of variables:\n\nLet me label equation 1 as Eq1 and equation 2 as Eq2.\n\nWe can try to eliminate one variable. Let's try to eliminate 'a' first. To do that, we can multiply Eq1 by 76 and Eq2 by 49, so that the coefficients of 'a' will be 49\u00d776 and 76\u00d749, so they can be subtracted.\n\nWait, that might be a bit big, but let me try.\n\nMultiply Eq1 by 76:\n\n76*(49a + 21b) = 76*76\n\nWhich is 76*49a + 76*21b = 76\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, multiply Eq2 by 49:\n\n49*(76a + 49b) = 49*224\n\nWhich is 49*76a + 49\u00b2b = 49*224\n\nNow, subtract the first new equation from the second new equation to eliminate the 'a' terms:\n\n[49*76a + 49\u00b2b] - [76*49a + 76*21b] = 49*224 - 76\u00b2\n\nWait, note that 49*76a - 76*49a = 0, so those terms cancel. Then we have:\n\n49\u00b2b - 76*21b = 49*224 - 76\u00b2\n\nFactor out b on the left:\n\nb*(49\u00b2 - 76*21) = 49*224 - 76\u00b2\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 49\u00b2: 49*49 = 2401\n\n76*21: Let's compute 76*20 = 1520, plus 76*1 =76 \u2192 1520+76=1596\n\nSo 49\u00b2 - 76*21 = 2401 - 1596 = 805\n\nNow, the right side: 49*224 and 76\u00b2\n\nFirst, 49*224: 224 divided by 49 is approximately 4.57, but let me compute 49*200 = 9800, 49*24=1176 \u2192 total 9800 +1176 = 10976\n\nThen 76\u00b2: 76*76. Let's compute 70*70 = 4900, 70*6=420, 6*70=420, 6*6=36, so (70+6)^2 = 70\u00b2 + 2*70*6 +6\u00b2=4900+840+36=5776.\n\nSo the right side is 10976 - 5776 = 5200\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nb*(805) = 5200\n\nSo b = 5200 / 805\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5 first:\n\n5200 \u00f75 = 1040\n\n805 \u00f75 = 161\n\nSo now it's 1040 / 161\n\nHmm, 161 \u00d76 = 966, 1040 - 966 =74. So that's 6 and 74/161\n\nWait, so b is 1040/161, which is not an integer. Hmm. That's a problem because the problem is asking if there are integer a and b. Since this is a fraction, that suggests that maybe there are no integer solutions for a and b here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check my steps again.\n\nStarting again:\n\nOriginal equations:\n\n1) 49a + 21b = 76\n\n2) 76a + 49b = 224\n\nI wanted to eliminate 'a' by multiplying the equations by 76 and 49 respectively. Let me check that again:\n\nMultiply Eq1 by 76: 76*(49a + 21b) = 76*76 \u2192 76*49a + 76*21b = 76\u00b2\n\nMultiply Eq2 by 49: 49*(76a +49b) =49*224 \u219249*76a +49\u00b2b =49*224\n\nSubtracting the first result from the second:\n\n[49*76a +49\u00b2 b] - [76*49a +76*21b] =49*224 -76\u00b2\n\nLeft side: 49*76a -76*49a cancels out. Then 49\u00b2 b -76*21b.\n\n49\u00b2 is 2401, 76*21 is 1596. So 2401 -1596 = 805, so 805b.\n\nRight side: 49*224 = let's recompute 49*224:\n\n49*200 =9800, 49*24=1176, so 9800+1176=10976\n\n76\u00b2=5776, so 10976 -5776=5200. So 805b=5200.\n\nThus, b=5200/805. Let me simplify this fraction.\n\nFind GCD of 5200 and 805. Let's see:\n\nDivide 5200 by 805:\n\n805*6=4830. 5200-4830=370\n\nNow GCD(805,370). 805 divided by 370 is 2*370=740, remainder 65.\n\nGCD(370,65). 370 divided by 65 is 5*65=325, remainder 45.\n\nGCD(65,45). 65 divided by 45 is 1*45=45, remainder 20.\n\nGCD(45,20). 45 divided by 20=2*20=40, remainder 5.\n\nGCD(20,5). 20 divided by 5 is 4, remainder 0. So GCD is 5.\n\nTherefore, 5200 \u00f75=1040, 805 \u00f75=161. So 1040/161. Hmm, 161 is 23*7, 1040 divided by 161?\n\n161*6=966, 1040-966=74, so 6 and 74/161. So it's not an integer. So that suggests that there is no integer solution for b here. Therefore, maybe there is no such a and b as integers for the Fibonacci-like recurrence. So perhaps the problem is suggesting to check another possibility, like adding a constant term?\n\nThe problem also mentions: \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\". So maybe the recurrence is linear with a constant term. Let me try that.\n\nSo now, we need to consider three equations if we include the constant term c. However, since we have two terms given (k7 and k8), but if we have three variables (a, b, c), we need another equation. Wait, but maybe the problem is considering that this is the first two equations for the recurrence? Wait, perhaps the prior terms are known?\n\nWait, actually, the problem mentions \"FIBONACCI-LIKE RECURRENCE CHECK\" so maybe the prior terms are given? Wait, the problem just mentions k7=76 and k8=224, so maybe the previous terms (like k1 to k6) are known? Wait, the problem didn't give us previous terms. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, the user's problem statement is a bit unclear. Let me re-read the original problem:\n\n\"FIBONACCI-LIKE RECURRENCE CHECK\n\nDoes the sequence follow a recurrence like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\n\nTEST: Can we find a, b such that k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\n\nFor k7 = 76:\n\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n\n224 = 76a + 49b\n\nSolve system:\n\nFrom first: 76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFrom second: 224 = 76a + 49b\n\nCan you find integer a, b?\n\nAlso try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\n\nThis is important - if there's a recurrence, we can predict k15, k16! Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}\"\n\nWait, okay, so the problem is giving me the equations for k7 and k8 in terms of previous terms, but in the equations, they use k_{n-1} and k_{n-2}. For example, for k7, they use 49 and 21. So presumably, 49 is k6 and 21 is k5? Let me confirm:\n\nSuppose the recurrence is supposed to be valid for n \u22653 or something. So for k7, the recurrence would need k6 and k5. So, the equations given are:\n\nk7 = a*k6 + b*k5 \u2192 76 = a*49 + b*21\n\nk8 = a*k7 + b*k6 \u2192 224 = a*76 + b*49\n\nSo that makes sense. So the prior terms (k5, k6) are given as 21 and 49 respectively. Wait, but the problem didn't explicitly state that k5 =21 and k6=49. Wait, but the equations given use 49 and 21, so likely that in the original sequence, those prior terms are 21 and 49. So maybe the problem assumes that prior terms are known? Since the user is asking to solve these equations, perhaps the prior terms are given as k5=21 and k6=49. So that is the context. Therefore, with that, we have to find a and b such that k7 and k8 follow the recurrence.\n\nSo proceeding with that. Since with a and b needing to be integers, but we found that b=5200/805\u22486.45, which is not integer. Hmm. So that suggests there is no integer solution. Therefore, the Fibonacci-like recurrence (without constant term) might not hold. Let me check if maybe the equations are correct?\n\nWait, let's check the equations again. Suppose k7 is 76, and according to the equation, it's a*(k6) + b*(k5). If k6=49 and k5=21, then the first equation is correct. Similarly, k8=224 is supposed to be a*k7 + b*k6, so a*76 + b*49. So those equations are correctly set up. So the problem is asking to solve for a and b, but they might not be integers. Alternatively, maybe fractions? But the problem says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So the answer is no?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me try solving the equations again, maybe using substitution.\n\nLet me try substitution:\n\nFrom equation 1: 49a +21b =76\n\nLet me solve for a:\n\n49a =76 -21b\n\na= (76 -21b)/49\n\nNow plug this into equation 2:\n\n76a +49b=224\n\nSubstitute a:\n\n76*( (76 -21b)/49 ) +49b =224\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst term: 76*(76 -21b)/49\n\nSecond term: 49b\n\nSo:\n\n[76*(76 -21b) +49*49b]/49 =224\n\nWait, to combine terms, perhaps multiply both sides by 49:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49\u00b2b =224*49\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 76*76 -76*21b. Let's compute 76*76 first. 70\u00b2=4900, 2*70*6=840, 6\u00b2=36. So (70+6)^2=4900+840+36=5776. So first term is 5776 - 76*21 b\n\nSecond term: 49\u00b2*b=2401b\n\nRight side: 224*49. Let's compute 224*50=11200 minus 224 gives 11200-224=10976.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\n5776 - 76*21 b +2401 b =10976\n\nCompute the coefficients of b:\n\n-76*21 b +2401 b. Let's compute -76*21 first:\n\n76*20=1520, 76*1=76, so total 1520+76=1596. So -1596b +2401b = (2401 -1596)b = 805b\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n5776 +805b =10976\n\nSubtract 5776 from both sides:\n\n805b =10976 -5776 =5200\n\nThus, same as before, b=5200/805\u22486.459... So same result. So indeed, not integer. Hence no integer solution for a and b. So the Fibonacci-like recurrence without a constant term doesn't hold here.\n\nHmm, but the problem also says \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\". So maybe with a constant term, there is a solution?\n\nLet me try that. Let's consider the recurrence with a constant term: k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2} + c.\n\nNow, since we have two equations (for k7 and k8), but three variables (a, b, c), we need a third equation. Wait, but maybe the prior terms can be used? Wait, the problem only gives us k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224. So maybe we can use k6 in terms of k4 and k3? But we don't have data for k4 and k3. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects to use k7 and k8 and assume that the recurrence holds for previous terms?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can set up two equations with three variables and see if there is a solution. Let's see:\n\nWe need to find a, b, c such that:\n\nFor n=7: 76 = a*49 + b*21 + c\n\nFor n=8: 224 =a*76 + b*49 +c\n\nSo now, two equations with three variables. To find a solution, we can express in terms of one variable. Let me subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate c:\n\n224 -76 = a*(76 -49) + b*(49 -21)\n\n148 =a*27 +b*28\n\nSo 27a +28b =148.\n\nHmm, so equation (1): 27a +28b =148\n\nAnd the first equation: 49a +21b +c =76 \u2192 c=76 -49a -21b\n\nSo, if I can find integers a and b such that 27a +28b =148, then c would be determined.\n\nLet me see if there are integer solutions for 27a +28b=148.\n\nLet me try to solve for integers a and b.\n\nLet me express a in terms of b:\n\n27a =148 -28b \u2192 a=(148 -28b)/27\n\nWe need (148 -28b) divisible by 27.\n\nLet me see possible integer values of b.\n\nLet me try small integer values for b.\n\nLet me see 28b \u2261148 mod 27.\n\n28 mod27=1, so 28b mod27 =b mod27.\n\n148 mod27: 27*5=135, 148-135=13. So 148 \u226113 mod27.\n\nThus equation mod27: (148 -28b) \u226113 -b \u22610 mod27.\n\nThus 13 -b \u22610 mod27 \u2192 b\u226113 mod27.\n\nSo possible b=13, 13+27=40, 13-27= -14, etc.\n\nLet me try b=13:\n\na=(148 -28*13)/27=(148 -364)/27= (-216)/27= -8\n\nSo a= -8, b=13. Then c=76 -49*(-8) -21*(13)=76 +392 -273=76+392=468-273=195. So c=195.\n\nCheck if this works for the second equation:\n\n224 = a*76 +b*49 +c \u2192 -8*76 +13*49 +195\n\nCompute:\n\n-608 + 637 +195 = (-608 +637)=29 +195=224. Correct.\n\nSo that works. So with a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nAlternatively, another possible solution with b=13-27= -14:\n\na=(148 -28*(-14))/27=(148+392)/27=540/27=20. So a=20, b=-14.\n\nThen c=76 -49*20 -21*(-14)=76 -980 +294= (76+294)=370-980= -610.\n\nCheck second equation:20*76 + (-14)*49 + (-610)= 1520 -686 -610=1520-1296=224. Correct.\n\nSo multiple solutions. So there are infinitely many solutions with integer coefficients if we include the constant term. But perhaps the problem wants the minimal or simplest solution, or perhaps with the constraint that the recurrence continues the sequence? However, since we only have two data points, there are infinitely many linear recursions with constant term that fit those two terms. Therefore, technically, there is a solution with a constant term, so the answer would be yes, but they might want specific values?\n\nWait but the problem says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" in the first case, and then mentions also trying with c. Since the question is about Fibonacci-like (without c), but when that doesn't work, trying with c. The original question is \"Does the sequence follow a recurrence...?\" So with Fibonacci-like (no c), the answer is no, but with the constant term, yes. But the problem mentions \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", so maybe the answer is there is no integer a and b for the Fibonacci-like recurrence, so the answer is \\boxed{No}?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the values of a,b,c? But since the problem didn't specify the need for integer constants? Wait the problem says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So in the first case, no, but with c, you can. But the question is \"Does the sequence follow a recurrence like...\", so if the answer requires the Fibonacci-like recurrence (without c), then no. If it allows a constant term, then yes. Since the problem first asks about Fibonacci-like (without c), then the answer is no. The problem says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So the answer is no, so boxed No?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation? Let me check again for a and b.\n\nWait, the user might have a different approach. Let me see if there is a fractional solution for a and b.\n\nFrom the first equation: 49a +21b =76 \u2192 divide by 7: 7a +3b =76/7 \u224810.857, but that's not integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a typo and the terms are different. Alternatively, perhaps the prior terms are different?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in another base? Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the terms. Let me check the equations again:\n\nFor k7=76, it's a*k6 +b*k5. Given k6=49 and k5=21, so equation is 49a +21b=76\n\nFor k8=224, it's a*k7 +b*k6 \u2192 a*76 +b*49=224.\n\nSo the equations are correct.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting non-integer coefficients? But it specifies \"integer a, b\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to consider that the recurrence holds for all terms, so the user is supposed to check if the previous terms also fit?\n\nWait, but we don't have previous terms. Wait, but if the recurrence is supposed to hold for all n\u22653, then we can use prior terms. For example, if k5=21, k6=49, and k7=76, then for n=7, we can also write k7 =a*k6 +b*k5 \u2192 76=49a+21b, which is given. Similarly, k6 should be equal to a*k5 +b*k4. But since we don't know k4, we can't use that. So unless more terms are provided, we can't form more equations. Therefore, with the given information, the answer is that there are no integer a and b for the Fibonacci-like recurrence, but with a constant term, yes, but the problem first asks about Fibonacci-like (without c).\n\nSince the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", likely expecting a boxed answer. Since the question is \"Does the sequence follow a recurrence like...\", the answer is no, since there are no integer a and b. So boxed answer would be \\boxed{No}?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the values of a and b even if they are fractions? Let me see:\n\nFrom equation 1: 49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b=224\n\nLet me solve this system.\n\nLet me use linear algebra:\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\n49a +21b =76 --> equation 1\n\n76a +49b =224 --> equation2\n\nMultiply equation1 by 76 and equation2 by 49 to eliminate a:\n\nEquation1*76: 49*76 a +21*76 b =76*76\n\nEquation2*49:76*49 a +49*49 b=224*49\n\nSubtract equation1*76 - equation2*49:\n\n[49*76a -76*49a] + [21*76b -49*49b] =76\u00b2 -224*49\n\nThe a terms cancel out.\n\nCompute the b terms:\n\n21*76b -49\u00b2 b = b*(21*76 -49\u00b2)\n\nCompute 21*76: 21*(70+6)=1470+126=1596\n\n49\u00b2=2401\n\nThus, 1596b -2401b = (1596-2401)b= (-805)b\n\nRight side: 76\u00b2 -224*49\n\n76\u00b2=5776\n\n224*49: 224*50=11200 -224=10976\n\nThus right side:5776 -10976= -5200\n\nThus:\n\n-805b = -5200 \u2192 b= (-5200)/(-805)=5200/805\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 1040 /161.\n\n161 divides into 1040: 161*6=966, 1040-966=74 \u2192 1040/161=6 +74/161. Not simplifying further.\n\nThus b=1040/161\u22486.46.\n\nThen plugging back into equation1:\n\n49a +21*(1040/161)=76\n\nCompute 21*(1040)/161= (21/161)*1040= (3/23)*1040=3120/23 \u2248135.652\n\nThus 49a =76 -3120/23 = (76*23 -3120)/23\n\n76*23= 1748; 1748 -3120= -1372.\n\nThus 49a= -1372/23 \u2192 a= (-1372)/(23*49)= (-1372)/(1127)= -1.216...\n\nThus a\u2248-1.216, b\u22486.46.\n\nSo non-integer coefficients. So the question asked for integer a and b, so the answer is no.\n\nHence the final answer is \\boxed{No}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{No}\n",
