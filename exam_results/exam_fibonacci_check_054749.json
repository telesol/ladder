  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence of the form k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}, where a and b are constants. If that's possible, then maybe I can also check if adding a constant c helps, but first let's focus on the linear recurrence without the constant.\n\nThe problem gives me two equations based on the known terms k7 = 76 and k8 = 224. The previous two terms before k7 are k6 = 21 and k5 = 49. Wait, actually, hold on, let me make sure I have the indices right. The user wrote:\n\n\"For k7 = 76:\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n224 = 76a + 49b\"\n\nSo that implies that for k7, the previous two terms are k6=21 and k5=49? Wait, but in a Fibonacci-like sequence, the nth term would depend on the two immediately preceding terms, so k7 would depend on k6 and k5. So the equations are set up correctly here. \n\nSo, to restate the problem, we have two equations:\n\n1) 49a + 21b = 76\n2) 76a + 49b = 224\n\nWe need to solve for a and b. The question is whether there are integer solutions for a and b here. Let me see.\n\nFirst, perhaps I can solve this system of equations. Let me write them out:\n\nEquation 1: 49a + 21b = 76\n\nEquation 2: 76a + 49b = 224\n\nHmm. Let's try to solve this system. Maybe using substitution or elimination. Since the coefficients are kind of similar, elimination might be a good approach here.\n\nLet me denote the equations as:\n\n49a + 21b = 76 --> Equation (1)\n\n76a + 49b = 224 --> Equation (2)\n\nTo eliminate one variable, let's try to make the coefficients of 'a' or 'b' the same. Let me see which variable is easier. Let me try to eliminate 'a' first.\n\nThe coefficients of 'a' are 49 and 76. Let's find the least common multiple of 49 and 76. Hmm, 49 is 7\u00b2, and 76 is 4\u00d719, so they don't share common factors except 1. So LCM is 49\u00d776, which is a big number. Maybe elimination of 'b' is better?\n\nThe coefficients of 'b' are 21 and 49. 21 is 3\u00d77, and 49 is 7\u00b2. The LCM of 21 and 49 is 147. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply Equation (1) by 49 and Equation (2) by 21 so that the coefficients of 'b' become 21\u00d749 and 49\u00d721? Wait, that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps scaling the equations to make one of the coefficients the same.\n\nAlternatively, let's try using the elimination method step by step.\n\nLet me try to multiply Equation (1) by 76 and Equation (2) by 49, then subtract them to eliminate 'a'. Wait, that might be a way, but let me see:\n\nWait, actually, perhaps first write equations as:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me rearrange them:\n\nEquation1: 49a =76 -21b\n\nEquation2:76a =224 -49b\n\nHmm, maybe substitute a from Equation1 into Equation2?\n\nFrom Equation1: a = (76 -21b)/49\n\nPlugging into Equation2:\n\n76*( (76 -21b)/49 ) +49b =224\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n76*(76 -21b)/49 +49b =224\n\nMultiply both sides by 49 to eliminate denominator:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49b*49 =224*49\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term:76*76 = 5776; 76*(-21b)= -1596b\n\nSecond term:49b*49 =2401b\n\nThird term:224*49 = let's compute 224*50=11200 minus 224=11200-224=10976\n\nSo altogether:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b =10976\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n( -1596b +2401b ) +5776 =10976\n\n(2401 -1596)b +5776 =10976\n\n2401-1596 is 805, so:\n\n805b +5776 =10976\n\nSubtract 5776:\n\n805b =10976 -5776\n\nCompute 10976 -5776:\n\n10976 -5000=5976, then subtract 776 more: 5976 -776=5200. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait 10976 minus 5776:\n\n10976 - 5000 =5976\n\nThen subtract 776: 5976 -776 =5200? Let's see 5976 - 700 =5276, then -76 more is 5200. Yes.\n\nThus, 805b=5200\n\nTherefore, b=5200 /805\n\nLet me compute that fraction. Let's see if it can be reduced.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n5200 \u00f75=1040; 805 \u00f75=161\n\nSo 1040/161. Let's see if 161 divides into 1040.\n\n161*6=966, 1040-966=74. So no, it doesn't divide evenly.\n\nHmm, so b is 1040/161 \u22486.46. Not an integer. Hmm, that's a problem because the user is asking for integer a and b. Wait, maybe I made an arithmetic mistake?\n\nLet me check my steps again.\n\nStarting from:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nSolving Equation1 for a:\n\na=(76 -21b)/49\n\nSubstitute into Equation2:\n\n76*(76 -21b)/49 +49b =224\n\nMultiply all terms by 49:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49*49b =224*49\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term:76*76=5776; 76*(-21b)= -1596b\n\nSecond term:49*49b=2401b\n\nThird term:224*49: Let's recalculate 224*49:\n\n224*50=11200, minus 224 gives 11200-224=10976. That's correct.\n\nSo adding first and second terms:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b =5776 + (2401 -1596)b\n\n2401-1596 is indeed 805. So 5776 +805b =10976\n\nThen 805b =10976 -5776 =5200. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo b=5200/805. Let me see if that reduces. Let's check GCD of 5200 and 805.\n\nDivide 5200 by 805. Let's see:\n\n805 * 6 =4830, 5200-4830=370\n\nSo GCD(805,370). 805 \u00f7370=2 with remainder 65. Then GCD(370,65). 370 \u00f765=5 r45. GCD(65,45). 65 \u00f745=1 r20. GCD(45,20). 45 \u00f720=2 r5. GCD(20,5)=5. So GCD is 5.\n\nTherefore, 5200 \u00f75=1040; 805 \u00f75=161. So 1040/161. 161 is 7\u00d723, so maybe?\n\nWait 161 divided by 7 is 23. So 161=7\u00d723, so 1040/161. 1040 divided by 7 is 148.57, so not an integer. So b is a fraction. Therefore, if the problem requires integer a and b, then there is no solution here. Hmm, but the user is asking if we can find integer a,b. So maybe the answer is no?\n\nBut let me check if I set up the equations correctly. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe user says:\n\n\"For k7 = 76:\n\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n\n76 = 49a +21b\n\nFor k8 =224:\n\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n\n224=76a +49b\"\n\nSo that seems correct. So if k7 is the 7th term, then yes, it should be a times the 6th term plus b times the 5th term. Wait, but in a Fibonacci sequence, each term is a combination of the two previous terms. So k7 is a*k6 + b*k5. The user has k6=21 and k5=49? Wait, hold on, that might be where the confusion is. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the problem setup, the user refers to k7 and k8. So the terms before that: To compute k7, you need k6 and k5. The equations are set up as k7 = a*k6 + b*k5, so 76 =a*49 +b*21. Wait, but if k5 is 49 and k6 is21, then that would mean that the sequence is decreasing? Because 49 is k5, then k6 is21, which is smaller. Then k7 is76, which is bigger again. So maybe the indices are correct? Or perhaps there is a mix-up?\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps there is a mistake in the terms. Let me see: If k5 is 49, k6 is21, then k7 would be a*k6 +b*k5. So that's okay. But let me check if the terms are in the right order. Maybe the user is numbering the terms differently. But given that the equations are set up as such, I have to go with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem setup, but since that's what's given, I have to proceed. So with the equations as they are, solving gives fractional a and b, so no integer solutions. Therefore, the answer would be that there are no integer a,b such that the recurrence holds. But the problem says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" so maybe the answer is no? But let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an arithmetic mistake in solving?\n\nWait let's try another approach. Let me write the equations again:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me try to solve for a and b using another method. Let me subtract or combine equations.\n\nLet me try multiplying Equation1 by 76 and Equation2 by 49, then subtract to eliminate 'a':\n\nEquation1*76: 49*76 a +21*76 b =76*76\n\nEquation2*49:76*49 a +49*49 b =224*49\n\nSubtract Equation1*76 - Equation2*49:\n\n[49*76a -76*49a] + [21*76b -49*49b] =76\u00b2 -224*49\n\nThe first terms cancel out (since 49*76a -76*49a =0)\n\nSo remaining terms:\n\n21*76b -49\u00b2 b =76\u00b2 -224*49\n\nFactor b:\n\nb*(21*76 -49\u00b2) =76\u00b2 -224*49\n\nCompute each part:\n\n21*76: 21*70=1470, 21*6=126 \u2192 1470+126=1596\n\n49\u00b2=2401\n\nSo coefficient of b is 1596 -2401= -805\n\nRight side:76\u00b2 -224*49\n\n76\u00b2=5776\n\n224*49=10976\n\n5776 -10976= -5200\n\nThus:\n\n-805b = -5200 \u2192 b= (-5200)/(-805)=5200/805. Same as before. So 5200 divided by805. So same result, which is not integer. So b is 5200/805.\n\nHmm, so maybe fractions? Let me see if that reduces. Let me check 5200 divided by 5 is 1040, 805 divided by5 is161. So 1040/161. 161\u00d76=966, 1040-966=74. So 1040/161=6 and 74/161. Not a whole number. So no, so that suggests there are no integer solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows a and b to be fractions? The problem says \"Can you find a, b such that...\" but it doesn't specify integers. Wait, the user added \"Can you find integer a, b?\" so they are asking specifically for integer constants. So given that, then the answer is no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the problem setup. Let me see. Wait, the user presented k7=76 and k8=224, with k6=21, k5=49. Wait, but if we suppose that the previous terms are k5=49, k6=21, then k7=76, then k8=224. Let me check if with some a and b, even non-integer, the next terms can be predicted. But the problem is asking for integer a and b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended different previous terms? Or maybe the indices are mixed up?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is considering a different starting point. Maybe the terms before k5 and k6? Wait, but without more information, I have to go with what's given.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there might be an error in the problem's given numbers. Let me try plugging in some integer a and b to see.\n\nSuppose someone guessed a=3, then plugging into first equation:\n\n49*3 +21b=76 \u2192147 +21b=76 \u219221b= -71 \u2192b is negative fraction. Not good.\n\nIf a=2:\n\n49*2 +21b=76 \u219298 +21b=76 \u219221b= -22 \u2192b=-22/21. Not integer.\n\na=1:\n\n49 +21b=76 \u219221b=27 \u2192b=27/21=9/7\u22481.28. Not integer.\n\na=4:\n\n49*4=196. 196+21b=76 \u219221b= -120 \u2192b= -120/21= -40/7. Not integer.\n\na=0:\n\n21b=76 \u2192b\u22483.619. Not integer.\n\na=5:\n\n49*5=245 \u2192245+21b=76\u219221b= -169\u2192b\u2248-8.047. Not integer.\n\nNegative a?\n\na=-1:\n\n-49 +21b=76 \u219221b=125 \u2192b\u22485.952.\n\nHmm, so no integer solutions here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equations are swapped? Let me check. If instead, the 76 is a*21 + b*49, which would be if the terms are reversed. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the equation was k7 =a*k5 +b*k6, so 76 =a*49 +b*21 vs 76= a*21 +b*49. Let me see if that works.\n\nWait, the user's equations are:\n\nFor k7: 49a +21b=76\n\nFor k8:76a +49b=224\n\nIf instead the equations were:\n\nk7 = a*k5 + b*k6 \u2192 a*49 +b*21=76 which is the same as the user's equation.\n\nAlternatively, if there was a different assignment, but unless the problem has different terms, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the previous terms are different? For example, perhaps k5=21 and k6=49? Let me see. If that were the case, then k7= a*49 +b*21, but then the equations would be:\n\nk7= a*49 +b*21 =76,\n\nk8= a*76 +b*49=224.\n\nWait, but then that's the same as the original equations. So no difference.\n\nAlternatively, if k6 was 49 and k5 was 21, so switching the previous two terms, then:\n\nk7 =a*k6 +b*k5 \u2192a*49 +b*21=76, which is same as original. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to consider a different recurrence, like a second-order linear recurrence with constant coefficients, but with different terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is asking for real numbers a and b, in which case, yes, there is a solution. But since they specified integer, then no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem's numbers, but given the problem as stated, the answer is that there are no integer solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants us to consider that maybe the previous terms are different? For example, if the 5th term is something else?\n\nWait, but without more information, we can't assume that. The problem gives the equations as they are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to try the second part of the question, which mentions \"the problem\" might also consider the possibility of non-integer a and b? But the question specifically says \"Can you find integer a, b?\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me try solving for a and b as fractions and see what happens.\n\nFrom first equation:49a +21b=76 \u2192 divide both sides by 7:7a +3b=76/7\u224810.857\n\nSecond equation:76a +49b=224. Let me write equations:\n\nEquation1:7a +3b =76/7\n\nEquation2:76a +49b=224\n\nHmm, messy. Alternatively, let me use substitution.\n\nFrom Equation1:7a= (76/7 -3b) \u2192a=(76/7 -3b)/7=76/49 - (3/7)b\n\nPlug into Equation2:\n\n76*(76/49 - (3/7)b) +49b=224\n\nThis seems too complicated. Alternatively, let's use linear algebra.\n\nThe system is:\n\n49a +21b =76\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nWe can write this as a matrix:\n\n[49 21 |76]\n\n[76 49 |224]\n\nCompute determinant: (49)(49) - (21)(76)= 49\u00b2 -21*76\n\n49\u00b2=2401\n\n21*76=1596\n\nDeterminant=2401-1596=805\n\nSo determinant is 805. Since it's non-zero, there is a unique solution.\n\nThen using Cramer's rule:\n\na= ( |76 21| ) /805\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |224 49|\n\nWhich is (76*49 -21*224)/805\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n76*49: 70*49=3430, 6*49=294 \u21923430+294=3724\n\n21*224=21*(200+24)=4200 +504=4704\n\nSo numerator:3724 -4704= -980\n\nThus a= -980 /805= divide numerator and denominator by 5: -196/161. Simplify further? 196 divided by 161. 161*1=161, 196-161=35. So 196=161+35. 35 and161 have GCD7: 35=5\u00d77, 161=23\u00d77. So divide numerator and denominator by7: -28/23. So a= -28/23.\n\nSimilarly, b= ( |49 76| ) /805\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |76 224|\n\nWhich is (49*224 -76*76)/805\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n49*224: 50*224=11200, minus 1*224=224 \u219211200-224=10976\n\n76*76=5776\n\nSo numerator=10976 -5776=5200\n\nThus b=5200 /805= same as before 5200/805=1040/161\u22486.46.\n\nSo the solution is a= -28/23 and b=1040/161. These are fractions, not integers. So the answer is no, there are no integer solutions for a and b.\n\nTherefore, the user's question's first part, asking if integer a and b exist, the answer is no. Then the problem mentions \"the problem\" might also consider the second part, \"F: Please reason step by step\", so maybe the user wants the answer to be boxed, but since it's a yes/no question, but the instructions say put the final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is part of a larger question where they might consider non-integer a and b? But the question specifically says \"integer\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation here. Let me check determinant again:\n\nDeterminant is (49)(49) - (21)(76)=2401 - (21*76). 21*70=1470, 21*6=126 \u2192 total 1596. 2401-1596=805. That's correct.\n\nThen a's numerator:76*49 -21*224. 76*49: 76*50=3800 minus76=3724. 21*224=4704. 3724-4704= -980. So a is -980/805= -196/161= -28/23. Correct.\n\nSo yes, no integer solutions. Therefore, the answer is no, but since the problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", maybe \\boxed{\\text{No}} or \\boxed{\\text{No solution}}. But maybe in the context, if it's a math problem expecting numerical answer, but since it's a yes/no, perhaps the user expects \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem allows fractions, then a and b are -28/23 and 1040/161, but since the question specifies integers, so no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me see an example:\n\nSuppose someone claims a=2 and b= (76 -49*2)/21=(76-98)/21= (-22)/21\u2248-1.047, which is not integer.\n\nAlternatively, a=3: (76-147)/21= (-71)/21\u2248-3.38.\n\nAlternatively, a= -1: (76+49)/21=125/21\u22485.952.\n\nNo integers.\n\nHence the answer is no. So boxed answer would be \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n\nBut maybe in some contexts, they want to write the fractions. But given the question specifies integers, and the instructions to put the final answer in boxed{}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended different numbers? But given the problem as is, the conclusion is no solution in integers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}\n",
