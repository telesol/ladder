  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is asking whether the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence, which means checking if there exist constants a and b such that each term k_n is equal to a times the previous term plus b times the term before that. They've given specific values for k7 and k8, which are 76 and 224 respectively. The equations provided are:\n\nFirst equation: 76 = 49a + 21b\n\nSecond equation: 224 = 76a + 49b\n\nWe need to solve these two equations to see if there are integer solutions for a and b. If there are, then the recurrence holds; otherwise, maybe we need to consider another form with a constant term c. Let me start with the first part.\n\nSo, first, let me write down the two equations again:\n\n1) 49a + 21b = 76\n\n2) 76a + 49b = 224\n\nHmm, solving this system of equations. Let me see. Since they are linear equations, I can use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination would work here. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, label the equations for clarity:\n\nEquation (1): 49a + 21b = 76\n\nEquation (2): 76a + 49b = 224\n\nLet me try to eliminate one of the variables. Let's try to eliminate 'a' first. To do that, I can multiply Equation (1) by 76 and Equation (2) by 49, so that the coefficients of 'a' become the same, then subtract them. Wait, but that might lead to large numbers. Alternatively, maybe multiply Equation (1) by 49 and Equation (2) by 21, to eliminate 'b'? Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe an easier way is to use substitution. Let me try solving Equation (1) for a in terms of b.\n\nFrom Equation (1):\n\n49a = 76 - 21b\n\nSo, a = (76 - 21b)/49\n\nHmm, but that might not be helpful immediately. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use elimination. Let's see:\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\n49a + 21b = 76 --> Equation (1)\n\n76a + 49b = 224 --> Equation (2)\n\nLet me multiply Equation (1) by 76 and Equation (2) by 49. Wait, that would make the coefficients of 'a' as 49\u00d776 and 76\u00d749 respectively, which would be the same. Then subtract them?\n\nWait, that might be a way. Let me try:\n\nMultiply Equation (1) by 76:\n\n49*76a + 21*76b = 76*76\n\nMultiply Equation (2) by 49:\n\n76*49a + 49*49b = 224*49\n\nNow, subtract the first multiplied equation from the second multiplied equation:\n\n(76*49a - 49*76a) + (49^2 b - 21*76b) = 224*49 - 76^2\n\nWait, but 76*49a - 49*76a is zero, so those terms cancel out. So, the terms with 'a' cancel, leaving only terms with b.\n\nSo, the left side becomes:\n\n(49^2 - 21*76) b = 224*49 - 76^2\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the coefficient of b:\n\n49^2 is 49*49 = 2401\n\n21*76: 21*70 = 1470, 21*6 = 126, so 1470+126 = 1596\n\nThus, 2401 - 1596 = 805\n\nSo, left side is 805b\n\nNow the right side:\n\n224*49: Let's compute that. 224*50 would be 11200, so minus 224 gives 11200 - 224 = 10976\n\n76^2 is 5776\n\nThus, 10976 - 5776 = 5200\n\nWait, 10976 minus 5776: 10976 - 5000 = 5976, minus 776 more is 5976 - 776 = 5200? Wait, 5976 - 700 is 5276, minus 76 is 5200. Yes, that's right.\n\nTherefore, 805b = 5200\n\nSo, b = 5200 / 805\n\nLet me compute that fraction. Let's see if it can be simplified.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n5200 \u00f75 = 1040\n\n805 \u00f75 = 161\n\nSo, 1040 / 161. Hmm, does 161 divide into 1040?\n\n161*6 = 966, 1040 - 966 = 74. Not divisible. Let me check if 161 is prime?\n\nWait, 161 divided by 7? 7*23 = 161. 7*23 is 161. Let me check 7*23 is 161? 7*20=140, 7*3=21, so 140+21=161. Yes, so 161=7*23.\n\nSo, 1040 divided by 161 (which is 7*23). Let's see if 1040 is divisible by 7 or 23.\n\n1040 \u00f77: 7*148=1036, so 1040-1036=4, so no.\n\n1040 \u00f723: 23*45=1035, 1040-1035=5, so no.\n\nSo, the fraction reduces to 1040/161, which is approximately 6.46. Not an integer. Hmm, so that suggests that b is not an integer, which would mean that with integer a and b, this system might not have a solution. But maybe I made a calculation mistake?\n\nWait, let's check my steps again.\n\nStarting again:\n\nEquation (1): 49a +21b=76\n\nEquation (2):76a +49b=224\n\nI multiplied Equation (1) by 76 and Equation (2) by 49, then subtracted them to eliminate 'a'. Let me recheck the coefficients:\n\nAfter multiplying Equation (1) by 76: 49*76 a +21*76 b =76*76\n\nEquation (2) multiplied by 49: 76*49 a +49*49 b=224*49\n\nSubtracting first from second:\n\n(76*49a -49*76a) + (49^2 b -21*76b) =224*49 -76^2\n\nThe first term (76*49a -49*76a)=0, so that's okay.\n\nCoefficient of b: 49\u00b2 -21*76\n\n49\u00b2 is 2401, 21*76 is 1596. 2401-1596=805. Correct.\n\nRight side: 224*49=10976 and 76\u00b2=5776. 10976-5776=5200. Correct.\n\nThus, 805b=5200 \u2192 b=5200/805. Let me see 805*6=4830, 5200-4830=370. 805*0.46 is roughly, but not exact. So, not an integer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try eliminating 'b' instead?\n\nLet me try that approach. Let me see if I can eliminate 'b' first.\n\nEquation (1):49a +21b=76\n\nEquation (2):76a +49b=224\n\nLet me multiply Equation (1) by 49 and Equation (2) by 21 so that the coefficients of 'b' become 21*49 and 49*21, thus equal.\n\nSo:\n\nMultiply Equation (1) by 49: 49*49a +21*49b =76*49\n\nMultiply Equation (2) by 21: 76*21a +49*21b=224*21\n\nNow subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate 'b':\n\n[49\u00b2a +21*49b] - [76*21a +49*21b] =76*49 -224*21\n\nLeft side:\n\n(49\u00b2a -76*21a) + (21*49b -49*21b)= 0 (since the b terms cancel out)\n\nSo:\n\n[49\u00b2 -76*21]a =76*49 -224*21\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\nFirst, 49\u00b2 is 2401\n\n76*21: 70*21=1470, 6*21=126 \u2192 1470+126=1596\n\nThus, 2401 -1596 =805\n\nRight side:\n\n76*49: as before, 3724? Wait, 76*50=3800, minus 76 gives 3724\n\n224*21: 200*21=4200, 24*21=504, so total 4200+504=4704\n\nThus, 3724 -4704 = -980\n\nWait, right side is 76*49 -224*21=3724 -4704= -980\n\nThus, 805a = -980 \u2192 a= -980/805\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: -196 /161\n\nAgain, 161 is 7*23, 196 is 49*4= 7\u00b2*4. So, 196/161 = (7\u00b2 *4)/(7*23)= (7*4)/23=28/23. So, a= -28/23\n\nHmm, so a is a fraction, not an integer either. So, this suggests that there are no integer solutions for a and b?\n\nWait, but the question says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So, the answer would be no?\n\nBut maybe I did something wrong here. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a miscalculation in the multiplication steps? Let me recalculate the right side of the second elimination:\n\nWait, when I subtract the second equation (after multiplying by 21) from the first (after multiplying by 49):\n\nThe right-hand side is (76\u00d749) - (224\u00d721). Let me recalculate:\n\n76\u00d749: 70\u00d749 = 3430, 6\u00d749=294, so total 3430+294=3724. Correct.\n\n224\u00d721: 200\u00d721=4200, 24\u00d721=504, so 4200+504=4704. So 3724 - 4704= -980. That's correct.\n\nSo, indeed, 805a = -980 \u2192 a= -980/805. Let me see if this reduces. Divide numerator and denominator by 35? 805 \u00f735=23, 980 \u00f735=28. So, -28/23. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, so both a and b are fractions. Therefore, there are no integer solutions for a and b. Therefore, the recurrence relation k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} with integer a and b does not hold?\n\nBut the problem mentions \"FIBONACCI-LIKE RECURRENCE CHECK\", so maybe allowing a and b to be fractions? The question says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So the user is specifically asking for integer constants? Then the answer would be no.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem states:\n\nFor k7 = 76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n\nFor k8 = 224: 224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n\nSo, assuming that the previous terms are k6=21 and k5=49? Wait, hold on, actually, in a recurrence relation, k_n depends on the two previous terms. So, if they are talking about k7, then k7 should depend on k6 and k5. So, if k7 = a\u00d7k6 + b\u00d7k5, then given k7=76, k6=49, k5=21, so 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721. Then k8 would be a\u00d7k7 + b\u00d7k6, so 224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the equations are set up properly.\n\nThus, since there are no integer solutions, maybe the answer is that there are no integers a and b, so the Fibonacci-like recurrence with integer coefficients does not hold.\n\nBut the problem also mentions \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\". So perhaps a linear recurrence with a constant term c?\n\nLet me try that. Let me consider the possibility of such a recurrence with a constant term. So, the equation would be:\n\nk_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2} + c\n\nWe need to find a, b, c (integers?) such that this holds for k7 and k8.\n\nLet me set up the equations:\n\nFor k7 = 76:\n\n76 = a\u00d7k6 + b\u00d7k5 + c \u2192 76 = 49a +21b +c\n\nFor k8 =224:\n\n224 = a\u00d7k7 + b\u00d7k6 +c \u2192 224 =76a +49b +c\n\nSo now we have two equations with three variables a, b, c. To solve for three variables, we need a third equation, but perhaps we can assume some previous terms? Wait, maybe the user expects us to use this with the previous term?\n\nWait, maybe they have more terms? The problem mentions \"predict k15, k16\" so maybe there are more terms in the sequence, but only k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224? The user hasn't provided all the terms, so maybe we can only use the given equations. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if we consider that if such a recurrence exists, then the difference between the two equations can eliminate c.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n224 -76 = (76a +49b +c) - (49a +21b +c)\n\nSo, 148 = (76a -49a) + (49b -21b) + (c - c)\n\n148 = 27a +28b\n\nSo, 27a +28b =148\n\nHmm, so now we have an equation with two variables a and b. Let me see if we can find integers a and b here.\n\nLet me write this equation:\n\n27a +28b =148\n\nWe can try to solve this Diophantine equation. Let me see.\n\nLet me rearrange for a:\n\n27a =148 -28b \u2192 a = (148 -28b)/27\n\nWe need a to be integer, so (148 -28b) must be divisible by 27.\n\nLet me see possible integer values of b such that 148 -28b \u22610 mod27.\n\nLet me compute 148 mod27:\n\n27\u00d75=135, 148-135=13 \u2192 148\u226113 mod27\n\n28 mod27=1, so 28b mod27= b mod27\n\nThus, 13 -b \u22610 mod27 \u2192 -b \u2261-13 mod27 \u2192 b\u226113 mod27.\n\nSo, b=13 +27k, where k is integer.\n\nThen a=(148 -28*(13+27k))/27\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n148 -28\u00d713 -28\u00d727k\n\n28\u00d713=364\n\n148-364= -216\n\nThus numerator= -216 -28\u00d727k= -216 -756k\n\nThus, a= (-216 -756k)/27= -8 -28k\n\nSo, possible solutions are a= -8 -28k, b=13+27k for integer k.\n\nWe can choose k such that a and b are integers. Let's pick k=0:\n\nThen a= -8, b=13, so c can be found from the first equation:\n\n76=49a +21b +c \u219276=49*(-8) +21*(13)+c\n\nCompute:\n\n49*(-8)= -392\n\n21*13=273\n\nTotal: -392 +273 = -119 \u2192 -119 +c =76 \u2192 c=76 +119=195\n\nThus, one solution is a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nAlternatively, choosing k=-1:\n\na= -8 -28*(-1)=20\n\nb=13+27*(-1)= -14\n\nThen c=76 -49a -21b=76 -49*20 -21*(-14)=76 -980 +294= (76+294)-980=370-980= -610\n\nSo, another solution is a=20, b=-14, c=-610.\n\nBut perhaps the simplest solution is a=-8, b=13, c=195. These are integers, so such a recurrence exists with a constant term.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that with a constant term, there are solutions, but without the constant term (i.e., Fibonacci-like with a and b only), there are no integer solutions.\n\nThe problem mentions \"FIBONACCI-LIKE RECURRENCE CHECK\" and then suggests trying with a constant term. So, the user might be expecting to see that a Fibonacci-like recurrence (without constant) isn't possible, but with a constant term it is.\n\nThus, the answer would be that there are no integer a and b for the Fibonacci-like recurrence, but there are solutions with a constant term.\n\nHowever, the problem specifically asks \"Can you find integer a, b?\" so the answer is no, but if allowing c, then yes. Since the problem first asks for a and b, the answer is no, but the user also suggests trying with c, so maybe the problem wants us to present that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation?\n\nWait, let me check with a=-8, b=13, c=195 whether it works for k8.\n\nCompute k8: a\u00d776 + b\u00d749 +c = (-8)*76 +13*49 +195\n\n-608 + 637 +195 = ( -608 +637)=29 +195=224. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for k7: a\u00d749 +b\u00d721 +c= -8*49 +13*21 +195\n\n-392 +273 +195= (-392+273)= -119 +195=76. Correct.\n\nThus, with c=195, a=-8, b=13, the recurrence holds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that there are no integer a and b for the linear recurrence without constant term, but with a constant term, such as c=195, the recurrence is possible.\n\nSince the problem mentions \"FIBONACCI-LIKE\" which usually refers to recursions without constants, but also suggests trying with a constant, so the answer is that it's not possible without the constant, but possible with it.\n\nHowever, the exact question is: \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So strictly, the answer is no. However, the user might want the answer with the constant term. Since the problem says \"Also try:...\", but does not specify whether constants are allowed in the first part. Maybe the initial question allows real numbers, but since it specifies integers, then the answer is no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup? Let me check once again:\n\nGiven k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224.\n\nIf the recurrence is linear without constant:\n\nk7 = a*k6 + b*k5 \u219276 =49a +21b\n\nk8 =a*k7 +b*k6 \u2192224 =76a +49b\n\nSolving these equations, as before, leads to non-integer solutions. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the previous terms are different? The problem didn't specify all the terms, so maybe there is a misunderstanding. The user only mentions k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224? Assuming that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the indices are different. For example, maybe k_7 is built from k_6 and k_5, yes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in another numbering? Maybe the user is referring to different terms? But as per given, it's correct.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that there are no integer solutions for a and b in the Fibonacci-like recurrence (without constant term). But with a constant term, there are solutions.\n\nSince the problem first asks for a and b (integers) and then suggests trying with a constant, the answer would be that it is not possible with just a and b, but possible with a constant term. The user might need to state both parts.\n\nBut since the problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", likely expects a specific answer. Since the first part asks for a and b integers, the answer is no, but the problem might expect the constants with c? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows fractions? Then a= -28/23 and b=5200/805 simplifies?\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nEarlier, we had a= -28/23 and b=5200/805. Let me see if these fractions can be simplified.\n\n5200/805: divide numerator and denominator by 5: 1040 / 161. 161 is 23\u00d77, 1040 divided by 23 is 45.217\u2026 Not integer. So, fractions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the problem setup? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo? Maybe the terms given are different?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects the answer with fractions? But the question specifies integers. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the answer is possible with a= something, but my calculation is wrong.\n\nWait, let me check the equations again:\n\nEquation 1:49a +21b =76\n\nEquation 2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me try to solve these equations step by step.\n\nLet me call equation1: 49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me multiply equation1 by 49 and equation2 by21 to eliminate b:\n\nEquation1*49: 49\u00d749 a +21\u00d749 b =76\u00d749 \u21922401a +1029b=3724\n\nEquation2*21:76\u00d721 a +49\u00d721 b=224\u00d721 \u21921596a +1029b=4704\n\nNow subtract equation1*49 from equation2*21:\n\n(1596a -2401a) + (1029b -1029b) =4704 -3724\n\n-805a = 980 \u2192a= -980/805= -196/161= -28/23. Same as before.\n\nThus, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects real numbers? But the question says integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the terms? Let me check with the given terms:\n\nIf k5=21, k6=49, then for Fibonacci-like sequence, k7 should be k6 +k5=70, but it's given as76, so that's different.\n\nk8 would then be k7 +k6=76+49=125, but it's given as224. So the given terms don't follow Fibonacci.\n\nTherefore, a linear combination with coefficients a and b is needed. Since the user is asking for integers, but it's not possible, so the answer is no. However, with a constant term, it is possible.\n\nBut the question specifically asks \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So the answer is \\boxed{No}. But maybe the problem expects the coefficients with the constant term, but in that case, the question is ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is another approach? Let me think.\n\nSuppose the recurrence is of the form k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2}. We have two equations:\n\nFor n=7: 76 = a*49 + b*21\n\nFor n=8:224= a*76 + b*49\n\nWe can write this as a system:\n\n49a +21b =76 ...(1)\n\n76a +49b =224 ...(2)\n\nLet me solve this system using substitution or elimination.\n\nLet me use elimination. Multiply equation (1) by 76 and equation (2) by49:\n\nEquation1*76: 49*76 a +21*76 b =76*76\n\nEquation2*49:76*49 a +49*49 b=224*49\n\nSubtract equation1*76 - equation2*49:\n\n[49*76 a -76*49 a] + [21*76 b -49*49 b] =76\u00b2 -224*49\n\nThe first terms cancel out. The second terms:\n\n21*76 b -49\u00b2 b = (21*76 -49\u00b2) b\n\nCompute 21*76: 21*70=1470, 21*6=126 \u21921596\n\n49\u00b2=2401\n\nThus, (1596 -2401)b= (-805)b\n\nRight side: 76\u00b2 -224*49\n\n76\u00b2=5776\n\n224*49: 224*50=11200 minus 224 \u219211200-224=10976\n\nThus, 5776 -10976= -5200\n\nSo equation becomes: -805 b = -5200 \u2192b= 5200/805= 1040/161\u22486.46\n\nWhich is not integer. So indeed no solution.\n\nHence, the answer is no. Therefore, boxed answer: \\boxed{No}\n\nBut the problem mentions trying with a constant term. If they consider that as part of the question, then maybe the answer is different, but the initial question is only about a and b. Since the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", likely expects \\boxed{No}\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the values of a and b even if they are fractions? But since it specifies integers, the answer is no.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\boxed{No}\n",
