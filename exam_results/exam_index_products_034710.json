Let's re-read the text.\n\nThe user message:\n\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n\nIs there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)?\n\nCalculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nI need to re-read the message carefully:\nThe observed info: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" so that means product of keys with indices 2 and 3 gives k5. That is an observation. Then another observation: \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\", which is a formula where index appears in the product (multiplying by 12, then subtracting 5). There's also hypothesis: Sometimes the index itself appears in the formula.\n\nThen check:\n1. For key k7, expression is maybe of the form ? \u00d7 7 + ?, and they computed 76/7 = 10.86, not integer.\n2. For key k8, we have ? \u00d7 8 + ?, but then computed 224/8 = 28 (which equals k8/8). That means f(8)=28? But wait, they say \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\", and the check gives: 224/8 = 28. That suggests that maybe the formula for k8 is f(n)*n + g(n) with some integers f(8)=28 and some constant remainder. Actually reading: \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\". Wait, they've computed 224 divided by 8 equals 28. So then if we let k8 be expressed as f(8)*8 + g(8) and the quotient maybe should equal f(n). But it's not clear.\n\nThen \"k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\". Then \"k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\". So k11 is also integer quotient if divided by its index.\nAnd then for key k12, the expression is maybe of the form f(12)*12 + g(12), and they computed 2683/12 = 223.58... but then mention that \"k8\u00d712-5=2683\". So k12 equals 28*12 - 5 if we use k8 value for some computation.\n\nSo the problem: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\" I need to compute f(7), f(8), f(9), f(11), f(12). But what are these keys? The text includes \"k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12\". It mentions that k5 equals product of k2 and k3. So maybe the keys represent some sequence where index multiplication appears.\n\nMaybe we can derive pattern from provided formulas:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\n\nThe hypothesis: sometimes the index itself appears in the formula, so f(n)*n + g(n) is a possible structure.\n\nWe see examples:\nk8 is \"28\u00d78\", which implies that maybe for some keys, there's no constant remainder? For example, k11 = \"105\u00d711\" and for k12, if we try to express it as something times 12 plus something: k12 = 223.58... but not clean because if we take the quotient of k8*12-5 over 12 then: k8=28, so 28*12 - 5 = 336 - 5 = 331 (not 2683). Wait recalc: Actually check: \"k8\u00d712-5\" is given as equals 2683. That implies that k8 must be something else? Let's solve for k8 if we assume it's f(n)*n plus remainder structure.\n\nWait, the text says: \nFor key k8, they computed: \"? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\" So k8 divided by 8 gives exactly 28. That means k8 = 28*8 which is 224.\n\nThen for key k12, they computed: \"2683/12 = 223.58...\" but then note that if you use k8's value, \"k8\u00d712-5\" equals 2683? Let's check: k8=28, so 28\u00d712 - 5 = 336 - 5 = 331, not 2683. So perhaps my reading is off. Possibly it's \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12\", but then they add \"but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". They might be suggesting that if you take the product of k8 (which equals 28) and the index 12, and subtract 5, you get 2683. Let's check: 28*12 - 5 = 336 - 5 = 331, not 2683.\n\nMaybe it's \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 something + something\"? Wait, re-read text exactly:\n\n\"OBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\n\nI see: They list key numbers and then a division by the index. So for each, they are trying to see if k_n divided by n yields an integer (which would be f(n)) or not.\nFor k7: 76/7 is not an integer so that quotient doesn't work.\nFor k8: 224/8 = 28, which is an integer.\nFor k9: 467/9 is not an integer.\nFor k11: 1155/11 = 105 (an integer).\nFor k12: 2683/12 is not an integer, but they note that \"k8\u00d712-5=2683\". So it implies that if we take f(8)=? Actually wait: They say \"k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\", and we know k8 = 28, then 28*12 - 5 = 336 - 5 = 331, which is not equal to 2683. Possibly there's a misinterpretation.\n\nMaybe the keys are being multiplied by something else? Possibly the multiplication factors are coming from other indices. The notation \"k_n\" might be some function mapping index n to some value computed through some product or sum pattern involving earlier k's. \n\nLet\u2019s re-read: \"OBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\". So that means key 5 equals the product of keys with indices 2 and 3.\n- \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" means key 12 equals (key 8 multiplied by 12) minus 5. \nAnd then they check if maybe other keys have similar formulas: \"k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ?\", \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\", \"k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ?\", \"k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ?\", and \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ?\". They then compute: \nFor k7, the quotient when divided by 7 is 76/7 = ~10.86, not an integer.\nFor k8, quotient is 224/8 = 28.\nFor k9, quotient is 467/9 \u224851.89,\nfor k11, quotient is 1155/11=105 exactly, \nand for k12, quotient is 2683/12=223.58, but then they note that if you do \"k8\u00d712 - 5\" (with k8 =28) you get 336-5=331, which doesn't equal 2683 either.\n\nWait re-read: \"but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". That means maybe there's a misprint. If k8 is not 28? Let\u2019s try to solve if k8 were different: if we want k8*12 - 5 = 2683, then k8 must equal (2683+5)/12 = 2688/12 = 224 exactly. That means maybe there's a misinterpretation: Actually, they might be saying that for k12, the expression \"?\u00d712\" plus \"?\" equals something like \"k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\". And since we already know k8 is 28 from earlier? Wait no.\n\nLet\u2019s try to re-read: \"So k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\". They then ask \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So likely the intended pattern is that for some indices, k_n can be expressed as (f(n)*n + g(n)) where maybe f(n) is the quotient of k_n divided by n if it divides evenly. In those cases:\n- For k8: 224/8 = 28, so f(8)=28.\n- For k11: 1155/11 = 105, so f(11)=105.\n\nFor k7 and k9, the division doesn't yield an integer quotient, so maybe there's no clean pattern. But then for k12, they note that if we try dividing by 12, we get a non-integer, but apparently it can be represented as \"k8 \u00d7 12 -5\", which when computed with f(8)=? That doesn't match.\n\nMaybe the idea is: There might be a pattern where sometimes you see the index multiplied in formula. In some cases, k_n = (some function of earlier indices) times n + some constant offset.\n\nWe are asked \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" The keys that yield integer quotient when dividing by n appear to be: k8 and k11. And then maybe also k? Possibly k? Let's check provided values:\n- For k7, quotient 76/7 is not an integer.\n- For k8, quotient 224/8 =28, so f(8)=28.\n- For k9, quotient 467/9 is not an integer. But maybe it can be written as (some factor)\u00d7n + remainder, then what would f(n) be? Possibly we take the integer part of division? But that's unclear.\n\nMaybe I need to re-read \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" The keys mentioned are: k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. But the checks only mention k7, k8, k9, k11, and k12 in terms of division by n? Wait: They list \"CHECK:\" then they have 1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ?, and they compute 76/7 = 10.86. So maybe k7 is 76. Similarly, k8 is 224, k9=467, k11=1155, k12=2683.\n\nSo the keys: \nk7 = 76\nk8 = 224\nk9 = 467\nk11 = 1155\nk12 = 2683\n\nAnd we have also earlier: k2 and k3 are used in k5. And they say \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\", but then later they mention f(n) for each key? But the question specifically asks: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So I suspect that given the pattern k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), we want to compute f(n) (the factor in front of n, presumably the quotient when dividing by n if it divides evenly). \n\nBut then what is the sequence? We have: \nFor index 7: k7=76. Write that as 76 = f(7)*7 + g(7). But we don't know f(7) and g(7) separately unless there's a pattern. They mention \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" and when dividing by 8, the quotient is 28 exactly. So for k8, if it divides evenly then likely f(8)=28 and g(8)=0.\n\nFor k11: k11=1155 = f(11)*11 + g(11) with division giving an integer 105, so probably f(11)=105 and g(11)=0.\n\nBut for the others, like k7=76 divided by 7 equals about 10.857, not integer; k9=467/9 approximates 51.8889; k12=2683/12 approximates 223.5833. So they are not integers, so maybe f(n) might be defined as the floor of that division or nearest integer? But then for k7, if we consider rounding down, 10*7=70 and remainder 6 gives g(7)=6, but 76/7 is actually exactly 10 R 6. But 76 divided by 7 yields quotient 10 remainder 6. For k9, 467 divided by 9: 9*51=459, remainder 8; so f(9) might be 51, g(9)=8.\nFor k12, 2683 divided by 12: 12*223 = 2676, remainder 7; so that gives quotient 223 and remainder 7.\n\nSo possibly the pattern is: \nk7 = 10\u00d77 + 6, f(7)=10, g(7)=6.\nk8 = 28\u00d78 + 0, f(8)=28, g(8)=0.\nk9 = 51\u00d79 + 8, f(9)=51, g(9)=8.\nk11 = 105\u00d711 + 0, f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\nk12 = 223\u00d712 + 7, f(12)=223, g(12)=7.\n\nBut then what about k5? They said earlier \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\". We don't know values for k2 and k3 though. Possibly we might not need to compute that. But the question says \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Which keys are given in checks? The checks list: \n1. k7 (76), 2. k8 (224), 3. k9 (467), 4. k11 (1155), 5. k12 (2683). Possibly that's what we need.\n\nBut then the question says \"for each key.\" Maybe they want to know: For a key of index n, if it can be written as f(n) * n + g(n), find f(n)? But our computed values would be:\nFor k7: 76 = 10*7 + 6 => f(7)=10.\nFor k8: 224=28*8+0 => f(8)=28.\nFor k9: 467=51*9+8 => f(9)=51.\nFor k11: 1155=105*11+0 => f(11)=105.\nFor k12: 2683=223*12+7 => f(12)=223.\n\nBut then what about k5? It is given as product of k2 and k3. But we don't have those numbers explicitly maybe because they are computed from some earlier pattern.\n\nMaybe the sequence is something like a \"magic square\" or \"factorial\" sequence? The question might be incomplete, but based on our division, it seems plausible that f(n) equals the quotient when dividing k_n by n if remainder exists, i.e. floor(k_n/n). But then for those keys where division yields an integer exactly (like 224/8=28 and 1155/11=105), f(n) is just that quotient.\n\nSo answer: \nf(7)=10\nf(8)=28\nf(9)=51\nf(11)=105\nf(12)=223\n\nNow, do we also need to include k2, k3? They are mentioned in the observation \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\". We might guess that if k2 and k3 follow similar pattern then maybe:\nLet's denote: maybe f(2) and f(3) such that maybe k2 = f(2)*2 + g(2) and k3= f(3)*3+g(3). And then k5 would equal k2*k3. But without more info, we cannot deduce those.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question intended \"f(n)\" to be defined as the quotient when writing k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) if possible, and if not divisible, then f(n) is the integer part of division? It might be the nearest integer? But the checks indicate they are testing divisibility.\n\nI need to check: 76/7 gives a remainder 6. So that's clear.\n224/8 =28 exactly.\n467/9: 9*51=459, plus 8 equals 467.\n1155/11 =105 exactly.\n2683/12: 12*223=2676, remainder 7.\n\nSo answer: f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, f(12)=223.\n\nDouble-check arithmetic: \nFor k7: 10*7 =70; plus remainder 6 equals76.\nFor k8: 28*8=224 exactly.\nFor k9: 51*9 =459; plus remainder 8 equals467.\nFor k11: 105*11=1155 exactly.\nFor k12: 223*12 =2676; remainder is 2683-2676=7.\n\nThus answer.\n\nI can now write the answer with explanation. I'll also note that for keys where division yields an integer, f(n) equals that quotient and g(n)=0; for those that do not yield an integer, we take the integer part of the quotient as f(n), and g(n) is the remainder. So our computed values are:\nk7: f(7)=10, k8: f(8)=28, k9: f(9)=51, k11: f(11)=105, k12: f(12)=223.\n\nI can present this answer in plain text with explanation. I'll also mention that these values are derived by dividing each k_n by its index n and taking the quotient if it divides evenly or using floor division for others.\n\nThus final answer: \nf(7) = 10, \nf(8) = 28, \nf(9) = 51, \nf(11)=105, \nf(12)=223.\n\nI'll now produce final answer accordingly.</think>We can try to \u201cfactor\u2010out\u201d the index n from each key by writing\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n).\n\nIn some cases k\u2099 happens to be a multiple of n (so that g(n)=0), and in others it isn\u2019t.
