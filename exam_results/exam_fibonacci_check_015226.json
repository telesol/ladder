  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence, which is a linear recurrence relation of order 2. The question is asking if there exist constants a and b such that each term k_n is equal to a times the previous term plus b times the term before that. The given terms are k\u2087 = 76 and k\u2088 = 224. They also mention trying a possible recurrence with a constant term c, but the main focus seems to be on finding a and b first. \n\nLet me start by writing down the equations based on the given information. \n\nFor the seventh term, k\u2087 = 76, the recurrence would be:\n76 = a * k\u2086 + b * k\u2085  \nBut wait, actually, in the problem statement, they wrote it as k\u2087 = a\u00d7k\u2086 + b\u00d7k\u2085? Wait no, looking back, actually the user says:\n\n\"For k\u2087 = 76:\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\"\n\nHmm, so maybe they are assuming that k\u2086 and k\u2085 are 49 and 21, respectively? Wait, perhaps the sequence prior to k\u2087 is given? Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"TEST: Can we find a, b such that k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\"\n\nThen for k\u2087 = 76:\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721. So here they must be assuming that k\u2086 = 49 and k\u2085 = 21. Maybe the problem has some prior terms? The user hasn't provided all the terms, just the equations for k\u2087 and k\u2088? Wait, actually, the problem is presented as a check whether the given terms (k\u2087 and k\u2088) can be expressed in terms of previous terms via a linear recurrence. But unless we know the previous terms, how can we set up the equations?\n\nWait, maybe the original problem (which the user is referencing) had some earlier terms? The user here just presents the equations as given. Let me parse the problem again carefully.\n\nThe user writes:\n\n\"Does the sequence follow a recurrence like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\n\nTEST: Can we find a, b such that k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\n\nFor k7 = 76:\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n224 = 76a + 49b\n\nSolve system:\nFrom first: 76 = 49a + 21b\nFrom second: 224 = 76a + 49b\n\nCan you find integer a, b?\n\nAlso try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\"\n\nAh, okay, so the problem is presented with the equations already set up, assuming that k\u2086 is 49 and k\u2085 is 21, and then k\u2087 is 76, and k\u2088 is 224. So they want to see if there are integers a and b that satisfy those two equations. Additionally, they suggest trying a recurrence with a constant term c.\n\nSo my task is to solve the system of equations:\n\n1) 49a + 21b = 76  \n2) 76a + 49b = 224\n\nAnd see if there are integer solutions for a and b. If not, then maybe try the version with c.\n\nFirst, let's see if there are integer solutions for a and b. Let me try to solve the system of equations.\n\nStarting with equations:\n\nEquation 1: 49a + 21b = 76  \nEquation 2: 76a + 49b = 224\n\nHmm, perhaps we can solve this using substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination.\n\nFirst, let's label them:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b =76  \nEquation2:76a +49b=224\n\nTo eliminate one variable, perhaps multiply Equation1 by 49 and Equation2 by 21, so that the coefficients of b will be 21*49 and 49*21, allowing us to subtract? Wait, but maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, let's try to make coefficients of a or b the same.\n\nAlternatively, let me write equations in terms of a or b.\n\nLet me try to solve Equation1 for a:\n\n49a =76 -21b  \na = (76 -21b)/49\n\nHmm, so a must be a rational number, but since we are looking for integer a and b, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps multiply equations to eliminate variables. Let me see.\n\nLet me consider multiplying Equation1 by 76 and Equation2 by 49, so that the coefficients for a will be 49*76 and 76*49, then subtract?\n\nWait, let me think of another way.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the determinant of the system to see if it has a solution.\n\nThe system is:\n\n49a +21b =76  \n76a +49b=224\n\nThe determinant D is (49)(49) - (21)(76). Let me compute that.\n\n49*49 = 2401  \n21*76 = 1596  \nSo D = 2401 - 1596 = 805.\n\nSince D is not zero, there is a unique solution. Let's compute the solution using Cramer's rule.\n\nFirst, the solution for a is ( (76*49 - 21*224) ) / D\n\nWait, let me recall Cramer's formula.\n\nThe solution for a is ( D1 / D ), where D1 is the determinant formed by replacing the first column (coefficients of a) with the constants.\n\nSimilarly for b.\n\nSo determinant D1 for a:\n\n| 76   21 |\n|224   49 |\n\nWhich is 76*49 - 21*224\n\nCompute that:\n\n76*49: 76*50=3800, minus 76=3800-76=3724  \n21*224: 20*224=4480, plus 1*224=224, so total 4704  \nThus D1 = 3724 - 4704 = -980\n\nSimilarly determinant D2 for b:\n\nReplace second column:\n\n|49   76|\n|76  224|\n\nSo 49*224 -76*76\n\nCompute:\n\n49*224: 50*224 = 11200 minus 1*224 = 11200 -224=10976  \n76*76: 5776  \nThus D2 = 10976 -5776 =5200\n\nTherefore,\n\na = D1/D = -980 /805\n\nSimplify that:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: -196 /161\n\nHmm, 161 divides into 196? 161*1=161, 161*2=322, so no. Let me see if 196 and 161 have a common factor.\n\n161 is 23*7, 196 is 49*4, which is 7^2 *4. So common factor is 7.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 7: -28/23.\n\nSo a = -28/23. Not an integer.\n\nSimilarly, b = D2/D =5200 /805. Let's see:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 1040 /161. 161 is 23*7, 1040 divided by 23? 23*45=1035, so 1040-1035=5, so 45 +5/23. Not integer. So 1040/161 is 6.459... Not integer.\n\nTherefore, no integer solutions for a and b. Thus, the system does not have integer solutions. \n\nHmm, so the question is, does this mean that there is no such recurrence with integer coefficients a and b? The problem mentions \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So since the solution requires fractions, the answer would be no, there are no integer a and b. \n\nBut maybe the problem expects non-integer a and b? The user says \"Can you find a, b such that...\", but then also says \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\". Maybe the first part is with a and b, and second part is with the constant term c?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is expecting us to consider real numbers, but since the question mentions \"integer a, b\", probably wants integer coefficients. Since the solution is fractional, the answer is that there are no integers a and b, so such a recurrence does not hold?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check the equations and the determinant.\n\nFirst equation: 49a +21b =76  \nSecond equation:76a +49b =224\n\nCompute determinant D: (49)(49) - (21)(76). Let me compute 49*49 first. 49 squared is 2401.\n\n21*76: 20*76 +1*76 =1520 +76=1596. So 2401-1596=805. That's correct.\n\nThen D1: replacing first column with constants (76 and 224):\n\nFirst row: 76, 21  \nSecond row:224,49  \nDeterminant:76*49 -21*224\n\n76*49: Let me compute 70*49=3430, plus 6*49=294 \u2192 3430+294=3724\n\n21*224: 20*224=4480, plus 1*224=224 \u2192 total 4704\n\nSo 3724 -4704= -980. Correct.\n\nD2: replacing second column with constants:\n\nFirst column remains 49,76; second column becomes 76,224\n\nDeterminant:49*224 -76*76\n\n49*224: Let's do 50*224 =11200 minus 1*224=224 \u219211200-224=10976\n\n76*76: 70*76=5320, plus 6*76=456 \u21925320+456=5776. \n\nThus 10976-5776=5200. Correct.\n\nSo the solutions are a= -980/805, which simplifies as I did before to -28/23, and b=5200/805 = 1040/161 \u22486.459. These are not integers, so the answer is no, there are no integer a and b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider real numbers? If so, then technically a and b exist, but they are fractions. However, since the problem specifically mentions \"integer a, b\", then the answer would be no. \n\nThe user also mentions \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\". So perhaps the next step is to check if adding a constant term c allows for integer coefficients. Let's try that.\n\nSo now, the recurrence is k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2} + c. Let's set up equations for this case.\n\nAgain, using k\u2087=76 and k\u2088=224, assuming that k\u2086=49, k\u2085=21, k\u2087 = a*k\u2086 + b*k\u2085 +c  \nSo:\n\n76 = a*49 + b*21 + c  \n224 = a*76 + b*49 + c\n\nWe now have two equations with three variables (a, b, c). To solve for three variables, we need a third equation. Since we only have two terms, maybe we can assume another term? The problem mentions predicting k\u2081\u2085 and k\u2081\u2086, so perhaps the original sequence has more terms, but the user hasn't provided them. Alternatively, perhaps we can set up the equations with c and see if there's a possible solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the previous terms? Let me see. If we consider that the recurrence could hold for earlier terms as well, but since the user only provided equations up to k\u2088, we might need another equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can set up the equations with c and see if there's a solution with integer a, b, c.\n\nLet me write the two equations again:\n\n1) 49a +21b +c =76  \n2)76a +49b +c =224\n\nSubtract equation1 from equation2 to eliminate c:\n\n(76a +49b +c) - (49a +21b +c) =224 -76  \nWhich gives: (76a -49a) + (49b -21b) + (c -c) =148  \nThus: 27a +28b =148\n\nSo now, this is equation3: 27a +28b =148\n\nWe also have equation1:49a +21b +c=76. So once we find a and b, we can get c.\n\nSo now, we need to solve equation3 for integers a and b. Let me see if there are integer solutions.\n\nEquation3:27a +28b=148\n\nLooking for integers a and b such that 27a +28b =148.\n\nLet me try to solve this equation. Let me express a in terms of b:\n\n27a =148 -28b  \na=(148 -28b)/27\n\nWe need (148 -28b) divisible by 27. Let me see for integer b:\n\nLet me check possible integer values of b such that 148 -28b is divisible by 27.\n\nAlternatively, rewrite the equation as:\n\n27a \u2261 148 mod28? Wait, maybe better to think of modulo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trial and error. Let's try some integer values for b.\n\nLet me note that 27 and 28 are coprime (since 27 is 3^3, 28 is 4*7, so gcd(27,28)=1), so the equation has solutions.\n\nLet me try to find integers b such that 27a =148 -28b. So 148 -28b must be divisible by27.\n\nLet me compute 148 mod27 first:\n\n27*5=135, 148-135=13, so 148\u226113 mod27.\n\nSimilarly, 28b mod27: 28\u22611 mod27, so 28b\u2261b mod27.\n\nTherefore equation becomes:\n\n27a \u226113 - b mod27  \nBut 27a is 0 mod27, so 0 \u226113 -b mod27 \u2192 b\u226113 mod27.\n\nThus, possible solutions for b are of the form b=13 +27k, where k is integer.\n\nSo let me set b=13 +27k, then substitute into the equation:\n\n27a +28*(13 +27k)=148  \n27a +28*13 +28*27k =148  \n27a + 364 +756k =148  \n27a =148 -364 -756k  \n27a =-216 -756k  \nDivide both sides by 27:\n\na= (-216 -756k)/27 = (-216/27) + (-756/27)k = -8 -28k\n\nThus, the solutions are:\n\na= -8 -28k  \nb=13 +27k\n\nfor integer k.\n\nNow, we can choose k such that a and b are integers. Let's pick k=0:\n\nThen,\n\na= -8, b=13, which gives c from equation1:\n\n49*(-8) +21*13 +c =76  \nCompute: -392 +273 +c =76 \u2192 (-119) +c=76 \u2192 c=76+119=195\n\nSo c=195. So possible solution a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nLet me check if this works for the second equation:\n\n76a +49b +c =76*(-8) +49*(13)+195  \nCompute:\n\n76*(-8)= -608  \n49*13= 637  \nSo total: -608 +637 +195 = ( -608 +637)=29; 29+195=224. Which matches the second equation. \n\nSo yes, a=-8, b=13, c=195 is a solution. So there is a recurrence with integer coefficients a=-8, b=13, and c=195. \n\nAlternatively, if we take another k, say k=-1:\n\nThen,\n\na= -8 -28*(-1)= -8 +28=20  \nb=13 +27*(-1)=13-27= -14  \nThen c=49a +21b +c=76? Let's compute c:\n\n49*20 +21*(-14) +c=76  \n980 -294 +c=76 \u2192 686 +c=76 \u2192 c=76-686= -610\n\nThen check second equation:\n\n76a +49b +c=76*20 +49*(-14) + (-610)=1520 -686 -610= 1520 -1296=224, which works.\n\nSo another solution a=20, b=-14, c=-610. \n\nBut since the problem didn't specify any constraints on c, there are infinitely many solutions with different k. However, the first solution (k=0) gives the smallest absolute values for a and b. \n\nTherefore, there exists integer a, b, c such that the recurrence holds. \n\nSo the answer to the original question (can we find integer a and b without c) is no, but with a constant term c, yes. Since the user mentioned to also try the constant term, so perhaps the answer is that with the constant term, there is a solution. \n\nBut the problem first asks for a and b (without c), then suggests trying with c. Since the user's exact question is \"F: Can you find integer a, b?\" so the answer is no, but with c yes. \n\nBut since the user might be expecting to answer the first part (without c), then the answer is no. But since the user also says \"Also try...\", maybe the problem expects us to consider the constant term as part of the answer?\n\nWait, the original problem is just the first sentence: \"Can you find integer a, b?\" Then \"Also try...\" is just a suggestion. \n\nSo the user might want the answer for the first part (no) and the second part (yes). But the way the question is phrased is \"Can you find integer a, b?\" with the \"Also try...\" as an additional thought. \n\nHence, the answer is:\n\nNo, there are no integer coefficients a and b such that the recurrence holds. However, with the inclusion of a constant term c, there exist solutions such as a = -8, b = 13, and c = 195.\n\nBut since the question is to answer within boxed, probably the first part. But since the user might want the answer with c, since without c it's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in Chinese and the translation is slightly different, but given the information, I think the key is to notice that without c, there is no solution, but with c, there is. Since the user included the \"Also try\" part, the answer is probably that with c you can, so the boxed answer would be the a,b,c values? But the question didn't specify which part to answer. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"F: Can you find integer a, b?\" followed by \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n\u22121} + b\u00d7k_{n\u22122} + c\".\n\nPossibly the problem is in Chinese, and the user is translating. Maybe the problem is exactly the first part, asking whether there are integers a and b for the recurrence without c, and the second part is just an extra hint. Given that, since the user says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", likely expects a \"No\" in a box? But usually boxed answers are for numerical answers. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial equations.\n\nWait, let me recheck the equations once again.\n\nAssuming that k\u2087=76, and k\u2086=49, k\u2085=21.\n\nThen if the recurrence is k\u2087 =a k\u2086 +b k\u2085 \u219276 =49a +21b  \nSimilarly, k\u2088=224= a k\u2087 +b k\u2086 \u2192224 =a*76 +b*49\n\nSo these are the two equations. We solved them and found non-integer solutions, so no integer a and b. \n\nHence the answer is no, but since the user might expect to write \"No\" boxed? But in Chinese math problems sometimes answers are numerical. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated? Let me try plugging a=-28/23 and b=1040/161 into the equations.\n\nWait, first equation:\n\n49a +21b =49*(-28/23) +21*(1040/161)\n\nCompute:\n\n49*(-28)/23 = -1372/23  \n21*(1040)/161 = (21*1040)/161. Let's see, 161=23*7, so 21/161 = 3/23.\n\nThus 21*(1040)/161 = (3/23)*1040= 3120/23\n\nThus total: -1372/23 +3120/23=(3120-1372)/23=1748/23=76. Which is correct.\n\nSecond equation:\n\n76a +49b =76*(-28/23) +49*(1040/161)\n\n76/23= (76 divided by23 is 3.304..., but let's compute:\n\n76*(-28)/23 = -2128/23  \n49*(1040)/161 = same as before, 49/23* (1040/7)= since 161=23*7, so 49/(23*7)*1040= 49*(1040)/(161)= (49/161)*1040= (7/23)*1040= 7*45.217\u2248 but exact:\n\n49*1040=50960; 50960/161=50960 divided by161. Since 161*316= 161*300=48300, 161*16=2576 \u219248300+2576=50876. Then 50960-50876=84. So 316 +84/161 \u2192 but maybe miscalculation.\n\nWait 161\u00d7316 = ?\n\nWait 161\u00d7300=48300, 161\u00d716=2576 \u2192 total 48300+2576=50876. \n\n50960\u221250876=84. So 50960/161=316 +84/161.\n\nThus 76a +49b= -2128/23 + (50960/161). Let me convert to common denominator 161:\n\n-2128/23= -2128*7/161= -14896/161\n\n50960/161 is as is.\n\nTotal: (-14896 +50960)/161 = (36064)/161 = 36064 divided by 161.\n\n161\u00d7224= 161*(200+24)=32200 + 3864=36064. So 36064/161=224. Which matches. \n\nSo the non-integer solution is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the first question is no. But since the user mentions the \"Also try\", which allows c, so maybe the problem allows c, and wants the values of a,b,c?\n\nBut the problem as stated first is \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So unless there's a translation issue, the answer is no. But since in some problems, even if you can't find without c, you might have to consider with c. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the equations. Let me see:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"F: Can you find integer a, b?\"\n\nThen \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n\u22121} + b\u00d7k_{n\u22122} + c\".\n\nPossibly the problem is in Chinese where the original question includes the constant term, but the translation omitted it. Alternatively, maybe the user just provides context. Given the information, since the initial question is without c, the answer is no. But since the user included the \"Also try\", maybe the intended answer is with c, and the boxed answer would be the a, b, c values. But how to box three numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement, and actually the recurrence is supposed to have a constant term, in which case the answer is a=-8, b=13, c=195. But since the user's first question is without c, it's conflicting.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the initial question strictly: \"Can you find integer a, b?\" the answer is no. But since the user may expect the answer with c, the possible answer is a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nBut given the instructions, to put the final answer in a box, likely the user expects the values with c. Since in many cases such problems expect the minimal solution. So I'll go with the a=-8, b=13, c=195. But the question didn't specify to include c. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo, and the equations are set up so that a and b exist. Let me recheck the given values:\n\nIf k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the recurrence is linear without constant term: k\u2087 = a k\u2086 + b k\u2085 \u219276 =49a +21b  \nk\u2088= a k\u2087 +b k\u2086 \u2192224=76a +49b\n\nLet me write equations:\n\n1) 49a +21b =76  \n2)76a +49b =224\n\nLet me solve this system.\n\nMultiply first equation by 49: 49*49 a +49*21 b =49*76  \nMultiply second equation by21:21*76a +21*49b=21*224\n\nThen subtract equations to eliminate b:\n\n(49\u00b2 a + 49*21 b) - (21*76a +21*49b)=49*76 -21*224  \nLeft side: (49\u00b2 -21*76)a + (49*21 -21*49)b = ... the b terms cancel.\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\n49\u00b2 = 2401  \n21*76= 1596  \nSo 2401a -1596a = (2401-1596)a=805a\n\nRight side:49*76 -21*224  \n49*76: 49*70=3430, 49*6=294 \u2192 total 3430+294=3724  \n21*224= 4704  \nThus 3724 -4704= -980\n\nThus 805a = -980 \u2192 a= -980/805= simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 35: -28/23. Which matches previous result.\n\nThen from first equation:\n\n49*(-28/23) +21b =76  \nCompute 49*(-28)= -1372 \u2192 -1372/23 +21b=76  \n21b=76 +1372/23 = (76*23 +1372)/23  \n76*23= 1748  \n1748+1372= 3120  \nThus 21b=3120/23 \u2192 b= 3120/(23*21)= 3120/483= divide numerator and denominator by 21: 148.571\u2026 which is 1040/161 (since 3120 \u00f73=1040, 483\u00f73=161). So yes, as before.\n\nThus, there are no integer solutions. So the answer is no. \n\nBut since the user included \"Also try...\", maybe the intended answer is with the constant term. Since in the problem statement it might be required, but the translation missed. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have different numbers. Let me see if I made a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait, checking the second equation with a=-8 and b=13, c=195:\n\nFirst equation:49a +21b +c=49*(-8)+21*13 +195 = -392 +273 +195 = (-392+273)= -119 +195=76 \u2713  \nSecond equation:76*(-8)+49*13 +195= -608+637+195= (-608+637)=29+195=224 \u2713\n\nSo that works. Thus with c=195, it's possible. Since the user mentions to try with c, then the answer is possible with a=-8, b=13, c=195. \n\nSince the user asks to put the final answer in boxed, and since the question allows for c, maybe the answer requires a, b, c. But how to box three numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the minimal a and b with c, so writing the triplet.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem might have been mistyped and actually requires the constant term, the answer is a=-8, b=13, so boxed as \\boxed{-8} and \\boxed{13}, but the question says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", implying a single box. Maybe as a pair: \\boxed{a=-8, b=13} but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have wanted the value of a + b + c, but that\u2019s speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have different numbers. Wait, let me check if the given terms make sense.\n\nGiven k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224.\n\nSuppose the recurrence with c is linear: k_n =a k_{n-1}+b k_{n-2} +c.\n\nWe found a solution a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nTesting further terms, like k9 = a*k8 +b*k7 +c = -8*224 +13*76 +195.\n\nCompute:\n\n-1792 + 988 +195 = (-1792 +988)= -804 +195= -609.\n\nBut without knowing the actual k9, can't verify further. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the coefficients a and b with c, so the answer is a=-8 and b=13, so boxed as \\boxed{-8} and \\boxed{13}. But instructions say put the final answer within a single box. Maybe \\boxed{-8} and \\boxed{13} separated by comma.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem first asks for a and b without c, and since it's impossible, the answer is \"No solution\", but in boxed notation perhaps \\boxed{\\text{No solution}}.\n\nBut given the \"Also try\" part, maybe the problem expects the answer with c, so the answer is a=-8, b=13, c=195. Since it's three numbers, perhaps written as \\boxed{(-8, 13, 195)}.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem only requires a and b with the minimal c, but instructions are unclear.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the initial question strictly (without c), the answer is there are no integer solutions. So I'll go with that. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-8}, \\boxed{13}, and \\boxed{195}\n\nHowever, considering the problem might require only a and b if c is allowed, but since the problem first asks without c, I think the correct answer is that there are no integer solutions, but since the user included the \"Also try\" part, the intended answer is with c. So the triplet is boxed together.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{(-8, 13, 195)}\n</think>\n\nGiven the problem of finding integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that the recurrence relation \\(k_n = a \\cdot k_{n-1} + b \\cdot k_{n-2}\\) holds for the terms \\(k_5 = 21\\), \\(k_6 = 49\\), \\(k_7 = 76\\), and \\(k_8 = 224\\), we start by setting up the equations:\n\n1. \\(49a + 21b = 76\\)\n2. \\(76a + 49b = 224\\)\n\nSolving these equations, we find that there are no integer solutions for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nHowever, when considering the possibility of a constant term \\(c\\) in the recurrence relation \\(k_n = a \\cdot k_{n-1} + b \\cdot k_{n-2} + c\\), we set up new equations:\n\n1. \\(49a + 21b + c = 76\\)\n2. \\(76a + 49b + c = 224\\)\n\nSolving these equations, we find the integers \\(a = -8\\), \\(b = 13\\), and \\(c = 195\\).
