We are given several observed values: k5, k12, etc.\n\nIt says \"observed: - k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\" then next line: \"- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\", then hypothesis: sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nIt then gives check examples:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo then: \"k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\". \n\nThen question: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nWe have keys: k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. But also maybe others? The given numbers are like: 76/7=10.86 and then check values: For n = 7, result is 10.86; for n=8, result is exactly integer 28; for n=9, result is non-integer 51.89; for n=11, result is integer (1155/11=105); for n=12, result non-integer but equals k8\u00d712 - 5.\nBut then question: \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" likely means find the coefficient of multiplication by n in the formula representation \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\".\n\nObservations:\n- For index 7: k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 is 10.857... but not an integer.\n- Index 8: k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 exactly, so f(8)=28 and then g(8)=? maybe we can compute the remainder from equation:\n   k8 = f(8)*8 + g(8) => 224 = 28*8 + g(8). But 28*8=224, so then g(8)=0.\n- Index 9: k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.888... but not integer f(9).\n- Index 11: k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 exactly, so f(11) = 105, and then g(11)=? Let's see: k11= f(11)*11 + g(11), 1155 = 105*11, that equals 1155, so remainder is zero.\n- Index 12: k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58333 but note also given that k8\u00d712 - 5=28*12 - 5 =336 - 5 =331? Wait recalc: 28 * 12 = 336, minus 5 gives 331, not 2683. Check: k8 is said to be 224/ ? Let's re-read the observation: \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\" That means that for index 12, we have a formula: k12 = k8*12 - 5. But then check \"5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". There's discrepancy here. Wait re-read that line: \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\" Possibly the actual observed formula is that when we plug n=12 in, then f(12)*12 + g(12)=2683 and also equals (k8*12 - 5) where k8=224? That doesn't match: If k8 = ? Let's re-read original: \"observed: ...- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" So that means if we plug in index 12, then the value is given by taking k8 and multiplying it by 12 then subtracting 5. But also the check says \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12\". That suggests that when you do k12 formula \"f(12)*12+g(12)\" equals 2683, but if we use the alternative representation k8\u00d712-5, then we get a different number? Let's check: For index 8, they computed f(8) = (224/8) =28. So k8 is apparently given as some value; maybe it's not the same k8 from earlier but rather k8 is an \"index\" in the notation of keys and their values. It might be that the pattern \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\" holds sometimes, and we want to compute f(n) for each key: n=2,3,5,7,8,9,11,12 maybe? But then observed k5 is not in this form because k5 equals product of previous keys? The statement \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" means that for index 5, the value is computed from indices 2 and 3. Then \"k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5\". So there might be a pattern where sometimes you multiply one earlier key by n then add or subtract something.\n\nWe have: \n- For index 7, k7 is not expressed in form f(7)*7 + g(7) with integer f(7)? Possibly we want to compute the quotient of k_n divided by n for each index n that satisfies a certain pattern. The check items are:\n   - k7: value unknown? It says \"76/7=10.86\" so maybe k7 = 76?\n   - k8 = 224\n   - k9: 467\n   - k11: 1155\n   - k12: 2683\n\nSo let me re-read the provided data with clarity:\nIt states: \"CHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\n\nSo likely the pattern is \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\" where f(n) might be computed by dividing k_n by n if that division yields an integer. For indices where it's not integer, maybe there's a pattern or relation with some other index's key.\n\nWe have:\n- For index 8: clearly f(8)=224/8=28.\n- For index 11: clearly f(11)=1155/11=105.\n- What about others? They are non integers. But question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" implies we want to express k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), and then compute f(n) from observed values if possible.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that sometimes when you try dividing by n, you get a whole number f(n). And apparently indices 8 and 11 have integer quotient. Then maybe we can guess: For index 7, k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ?, but not divisible evenly? However they gave computed value \"76/7=10.86\", so that suggests f(7) would be floor division? But the question says \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly meaning: for n in {2,3,5,7,8,9,11,12} (or maybe all keys) what is f(n)? But we only have explicit numbers for 7,8,9,11,12 and then mention k5 = k2 * k3.\n\nWe might try to deduce pattern:\nObservation: For index 12, they also provided a formula \"k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5\". That can be rearranged as k12 = (k8)*12 - 5. And since k8=224, that would give k12 = 28*12 - 5 = 336 - 5 = 331? But wait: The text says \"but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". That doesn't match, because 28 * 12 = 336, minus 5 equals 331. Wait check: maybe I misread the multiplication factor for k8: They said \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28\", so f(8)=28 and then g(8)=? Let's solve: k8 = 28*8 + g(8), but if 28*8=224, then g(8) must be 0. So k8 is exactly 224. Then \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12\" gives f(12)=? But they claim that formula equals 223.5833... so not integer.\n\nI need to re-read the text carefully:\n\nIt states:\nINDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo we have: \nk7 =?; k8 = 224; k9 = 467; k11 = 1155; k12 = 2683.\nAnd also given: k5 = k2 * k3, and k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5.\n\nI think maybe the pattern is that sometimes f(n) equals something like a product of previous keys divided by n? But then they ask \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly meaning derive function f(n) such that k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). And apparently when the division is clean, f(n) is integer.\n\nLet's list given indices and their computed values:\nFor index 7: value k7 = ? but they mention \"76/7 = 10.86\", so maybe k7 = 76? Because if you do 76 / 7, that equals approximately 10.857. So f(7) would be the integer part of (k7/n)? But it's not an integer.\n\nFor index 8: k8=224; f(8)=224/8 = 28 exactly.\nFor index 9: k9 = 467? Then 467/9 \u2248 51.888... so f(9) is not integer.\nFor index 11: k11 =1155; then 1155/11 =105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\nFor index 12: k12=2683; then 2683/12 =223.5833... so not integer.\n\nThen what about indices like 2,3,5? They are mentioned in observed facts:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. But no actual numeric value given for these keys?\nMaybe we have: k2 and k3 such that when multiplied equals k5, but then also sometimes the index appears in formula \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\". \nI think the idea is to extract function f(n) from the given pattern. Possibly if you subtract a multiple of n from k_n, what remains is f(n). For indices where it divides evenly, that quotient is f(n).\n\nMaybe there's a pattern: for prime indices? 2,3,5 are primes; but then 7 is also prime, 11 is prime, etc. But index 8 and 12 are composite.\n\nI see k8 = ?\u00d78 + ? with integer quotient of 28. So f(8)=28.\nk11 = ?\u00d711+? gives quotient 105, so f(11)=105.\n\nMaybe we can guess: For indices that yield an integer when dividing by n (like 7 gave non-integer though, but 8 and 11 give integers), maybe f(n) is computed as the integer part of k_n/n. But for index 7: 76/7 = 10.857, so what's \"f(7)\"? Possibly it's the nearest integer? Perhaps we want to compute f(n) in a consistent way.\n\nMaybe there's a pattern formula that involves previous keys: \nFor example: k12 = k8*12 - 5, so rewriting as k12 = (k8 - 5/12)*12, but then if you try dividing by 12, you get f(12)=? That doesn't match.\n\nWait, reconsider the statement \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly we are meant to deduce a general formula that yields f(n). We have observed keys: k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. The pattern might be something like:\n- For prime indices (like 7, 11) or composite ones? But then they are not all giving integer quotient.\n\nMaybe we can guess that f(n) is given by: \nf(2)= ? , f(3)= ?, f(5)= ? from k5 = k2 * k3.\nWe only know product relationship for k5, but no explicit numbers for k2 and k3. Possibly assume a pattern like:\nLet k1=1 maybe? And then subsequent keys are defined by some rule involving previous keys and the index?\nMaybe we can set up unknowns: Let k2 = f(2)*2 + g(2), etc.\n\nWe have: \nk5 = k2*k3. That might be one relation.\nAnd also, sometimes k_n = f(n)*n - something or plus something if n is composite? For example, k12 has an extra term from k8 and the index 12 appears explicitly in formula for k12: \"k12 = k8*12 - 5\". So that might be interpreted as: f(12)= k8 (if we disregard subtracting 5)? But then k12 would equal 28*12 -5, which equals 336-5=331, but that's not matching the given value of 2683. Alternatively, maybe it means \"k12 = ?\u00d712 + ?\" where the unknown \"?\" is obtained from something like: f(12) = (k8*12 -5)/12. That would equal k8 - 5/12 which is not integer.\n\nLet's re-read that line: \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\". Possibly it means: The product of the key at index 8 and the current index (which is 12) minus 5 equals the key at index 12. So, 28*12 - 5 = 336-5=331. But then they say \"2683/12 =223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". That indicates inconsistency: If we compute 28 * 12 - 5 we get 331, not 2683. So maybe the numbers are off? Possibly there is a misprint: It might be that k8 isn't 224, or maybe the formula for k12 is different.\n\nMaybe the line \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" should be interpreted as: The key at index 12 equals the product of the key at index 8 and the key at index 12's coefficient minus 5. That doesn't parse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in parentheses are not division results but remainders? For example, \"76/7 =10.86\" might mean that when dividing k7 by 7, you get 10 remainder something.\nLet me try to interpret: They write \"k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86\". That looks like they are trying the division algorithm on k7: Write k7 = f(7)*7 + r, where 0 \u2264 r < 7. And then 76 divided by 7 gives quotient 10 remainder 6 (since 10*7=70, remainder 6) and 6/7 is approximately 0.857. So maybe f(7)=10 and g(7)=6.\nSimilarly, for k8: \"224/8 =28\", so that implies f(8)=28 and g(8)=0 (since 28*8=224 exactly).\nFor k9: \"467/9 =51 remainder 8\" because 51*9=459, remainder 8. So f(9)=51 and g(9)=8.\nFor k11: \"1155/11 =105\", so that implies f(11)=105 and g(11)=0.\nFor k12: \"2683/12\". Let's divide 2683 by 12. 12*223=2676, remainder 7, because 12*223=2676, then 2683-2676=7. So that means f(12)=223 and g(12)=7.\nAnd also the line \"k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5\" if interpreted in terms of division: maybe they want to relate the remainder? Let's check: k8 is 224, so k8\u00d712 would be 224*12. But wait, what does that product equal? 224*12=2688, and then subtract 5 gives 2683. Yes! That fits perfectly now. So it seems that the line \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" is not meant to be interpreted as division, but rather a formula: k12 equals (k8 multiplied by 12) minus 5. And indeed 224*12=2688, and then subtracting 5 gives 2683. That makes sense now.\n\nSo we have the following keys (with index n, key value k_n):\nAssume we know:\nk2, k3 unknown?\nBut then: \nk5 = k2 * k3.\nWe also have computed values for others:\nk7 = 76? Let's check: if k7=76, then 76 divided by 7 gives quotient 10 remainder 6. So f(7)=10, g(7)=6.\nk8 = 224, so f(8)=28, g(8)=0.\nk9 = 467, so f(9)=51, g(9)=8 (since 51*9=459, plus 8 =467).\nk11 =1155, so f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\nk12 =2683, so dividing by 12: quotient is 223, remainder 7. So f(12)=223, g(12)=7.\n\nNow what about k2 and k3? They appear in the product for k5. Also note that we have k5 expressed as a product of two earlier keys (k2 and k3). Possibly the pattern is: For some indices n, k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) where sometimes the function f(n) has a \"nice\" value if the division yields an integer quotient or nearly so. And maybe for composite numbers, you can express them in terms of earlier keys.\n\nLet's try to guess k2 and k3 by pattern: The idea might be that the function f(n) is defined recursively using previous keys? For example, k8 = 224 which factors as 28*8, and maybe 28 came from some previous key like k4 or something. And k11=1155 factors as 105*11. And note 105 = 7*15, but not sure.\n\nMaybe there's a recurrence: For primes p, f(p) might be computed by summing something? We see for index 11 (which is prime), f(11)=105. For index 7 (prime), f(7)=10. For index 5 (prime), we don't know because it's given as product of k2 and k3.\n\nMaybe the rule \"Sometimes the INDEX appears in the formula\" means that sometimes the coefficient function f(n) is equal to one of the earlier keys, e.g., for n=12, f(12)=k8? Because 2683/12 =223, but k8 is 224, not 223. But notice: 224*12 -5 gives 2683, so if we solve 224*12 = 2688, then 2688 -5 = 2683, so that's the pattern.\n\nLet's check other indices: For index 11, we got k11=1155, and if I try to relate it to an earlier key maybe? 1155/11 =105. And notice, 105 is close to 7*15 but not sure.\n\nFor index 9, f(9)=51. For index 8, f(8)=28 which is a nice round number. For index 7, f(7)=10.\nMaybe these numbers come from something like: k_n = (k_{n-?} * n) + remainder. But then the pattern \"sometimes the INDEX appears in formula\" might be hinting that for some indices, f(n) is determined by a previous key multiplied by n and then adjusted.\n\nI suspect the answer expected is simply to list the values of f(n) as computed from division:\nFor k7: 76 = 10*7 + 6, so f(7)=10.\nFor k8: 224 = 28*8 + 0, so f(8)=28.\nFor k9: 467 = 51*9 + 8, so f(9)=51.\nFor k11: 1155 = 105*11 + 0, so f(11)=105.\nFor k12: 2683 = 223*12 + 7, so f(12)=223.\n\nAnd perhaps also for the product relation k5 = k2*k3, if we assume that k2 and k3 themselves follow the pattern \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\" then maybe we can deduce f(2), f(3) etc. But we are not given those numbers explicitly.\n\nMaybe I'll try to answer: \nGiven the observed keys, when expressed in the form k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), we find that for n=7,8,9,11,12:\nf(7)=10 (with remainder 6)\nf(8)=28 (exact multiple)\nf(9)=51 (remainder 8)\nf(11)=105 (exact multiple)\nf(12)=223 (remainder 7)\n\nAdditionally, the observed pattern k5 = k2 * k3 suggests that f(5) might equal something like? But without further info on k2 and k3 we cannot compute f(5).\n\nMaybe the answer expected is: \nk_n can be decomposed as follows:\n- For n=7: 76 = 10*7 + 6, so f(7)=10.\n- For n=8: 224 = 28*8 + 0, so f(8)=28.\n- For n=9: 467 = 51*9 + 8, so f(9)=51.\n- For n=11: 1155 = 105*11 + 0, so f(11)=105.\n- For n=12: 2683 = 223*12 + 7, so f(12)=223.\n\nAlso note that k12 can be alternatively expressed as k8\u00d712 - 5, which is consistent with the division algorithm since k8=224. That is the answer to \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" in the check list.\n\nI should also mention what g(n) are: \ng(7)=6, g(8)=0, g(9)=8, g(11)=0, and g(12)=7.\nAlso note that sometimes the remainder is nonzero, sometimes zero.\n\nTherefore, final answer:\nf(7)=10; f(8)=28; f(9)=51; f(11)=105; f(12)=223.\n\nI can also mention: Since k12 = 2683 and 2683 \u00f7 12 yields quotient 223 remainder 7, we have f(12)=223 and g(12)=7. And indeed, verifying the alternative formula for k12: k8\u00d712 - 5 = 224*12 - 5 = 2688-5=2683.\n\nThus answer.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in plain text.</think>We are told that each key k\u2099 can be written in \u201cdivision\u2010form\u201d as\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n)\n\nso that when you divide k\u2099 by n you get a quotient f(n) and a (smaller) remainder g(n). In the checks below the numbers have been chosen so that sometimes the division is exact and sometimes not. (Also note one extra relation: k\u2085 = k\u2082\u00b7k\u2083.) Let\u2019s see what happens with some of the given keys.\n\nFor example, for n = 7 we are told\n\u2003\u2003k\u2087 = 76.\nDivide 76 by 7:\n\u2003\u20037\u00d710 = 70\u2003with remainder 6,\nso that 76 = 10\u00b77 + 6. Thus here f(7) = 10 and g(7) = 6.\n\nFor n = 8 we have\n\u2003\u2003k\u2088 = 224.\nSince 224 \u00f7 8 is exact (8\u00d728 = 224), we write\n\u2003\u2003224 = 28\u00b78 + 0,\nso that f(8) = 28 and g(8) = 0.\n\nFor n = 9 the key is\n\u2003\u2003k\u2089 = 467.\nDividing: 9\u00d751 = 459, and 467 \u2013 459 = 8. Thus\n\u2003\u2003467 = 51\u00b79 + 8,\nso that f(9) = 51 and g(9) = 8.\n\nFor n = 11 we are given\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 1155.\nSince 11\u00d7105 = 1155 exactly, we have\n\u2003\u20031155 = 105\u00b711 + 0,\nso that f(11) = 105 and g(11) = 0.\n\nFinally, for n = 12 the key is\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 2683.\nDivide by 12: 12\u00d7223 = 2676 with remainder 7 (since 2683 \u2013 2676 = 7). That is,\n\u2003\u20032683 = 223\u00b712 + 7,\nso that f(12) = 223 and g(12) = 7.\n\nThere is also the relation k\u2081\u2082 = k\u2088 \u00d7 12 \u2212 5. Checking this:\n\u2003\u2003k\u2088 = 224 so 224\u00d712 = 2688, and then 2688 \u2212 5 = 2683,\nwhich confirms that the formula works.\n\nTo summarize, when we write each key in the form\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n),\nwe obtain for these examples:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003f(7) = 10\u2003(with remainder g(7)=6)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003f(8) = 28\u2003(with remainder g(8)=0)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003f(9) = 51\u2003(with remainder g(9)=8)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003f(11) = 105\u2003(with remainder g(11)=0)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003f(12) = 223\u2003(with remainder g(12)=7)\n\nAny answer that shows these values (and explains, for example, that 76 = 10\u00b77 + 6, etc.) is correct.",
