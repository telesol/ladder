We want to \"calculate f(n)\" for each key. But what's the data? The observed keys are: k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12 maybe. Let me re-read message.\n\nUser content:\n\n```\nINDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n\nIs there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)?\n\nCalculate f(n) for each key.\n```\n\nIt appears that the user is using keys with indices and numbers like k2, k3, etc. The text \"k2\", \"k3\" are presumably some known values: maybe the known keys are: \n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3? but then says \"(indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\". Possibly this is a pattern where one might expect that if you multiply indices 2 and 3, you would get index 5. But it's not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we are given some keys: k7 = 76, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, k12=2683, etc. The check shows: For n=8, then f(8)=? such that 224 = ? * 8 + g(8). It says \"k8 = 28\u00d78\" so maybe f(8) is 28 and there's no offset term (g(8) would be 0)? But let me re-read check: \"2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\" That means that k8 divided by 8 gives exactly 28, so f(8)=28 and g(8) must be 0 if it fits the form f(n)*n + g(n). But then \"4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\" means that f(11)=105 and likely g(11)=0. And \"5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ?\" but we see \"2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". So then maybe k12 can be written as (28*12 - 5) which is exactly f(12)=? But wait, let me check: If we use the pattern k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then for n=12 we want to get some representation. They are saying that 2683/12 is not an integer, but if you do (28*12 - 5) equals 336-5=331, wait 28*12=336, 336-5 = 331, which doesn't equal 2683! Let's recalc: k8=224. Then maybe \"k8\u00d712-5\" means multiply k8 by 12 and subtract 5. That is 224*12 - 5 = 2688 - 5 = 2683. So it says \"k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5\". But if we want to express that in the form f(12)*12 + g(12), then note that k12=28*12*? Wait, let's see: \n- k8=224, so maybe they want to compute f(n) for key n = 12 as f(12)= ? Possibly f(12)=k8 which is 28 because k12=k8\u00d712 -5 then if we divide by 12: (k8*12)/12 = k8 = 224 and then subtract 5/12. That doesn't match f(12) integer? Let's try to understand the message.\n\nUser says:\n\n- \"OBSERVED:\n   - k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n   - k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\"\n\nMaybe they are analyzing a sequence of keys. They then check for several indices: \n1. For n=7: k7=76\n2. For n=8: k8=224, so f(8)=28 and g(8) is presumably 0.\n3. For n=9: k9=467 (not clean when divided by 9).\n4. For n=11: k11 = 1155, which gives f(11)=105 exactly with no remainder.\n5. For n=12: k12 = 2683, and if we try division by 12 it's not an integer but the formula k8\u00d712-5 gives us 2683.\n\nWait, let me check k8 value: given as 224; so then 28 * 8 = 224. So f(8)=28.\nFor n=11: k11 is 1155, and dividing by 11 yields 105 exactly. So f(11)=105.\nFor n=12: The observation \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" gives f(12)=? Possibly if we write it as (224*12)/12 minus something then the linear term would be 224, but no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe they want us to calculate f(n) for each key based on the assumption that k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). And the only keys with \"clean\" division by n are: k8 and k11. Also possibly there might be a pattern in the multiplier when expressed as f(n)=k_{?} maybe?\n\nLet's re-read text carefully:\n\nUser says: \n\"HYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\nThus the pattern: maybe f(8)=28, f(11)=105. And then they ask: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nIt might be that we have keys indexed by some numbers with known values: maybe k2= ? , k3= ?, etc.\n\nThe observed \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" suggests that product of indices 2 and 3 gives the index 5's value? Let me check: if k2 * k3 equals k5, then what are k2 and k3? Possibly they are known keys. But not provided values for them.\n\nMaybe we have a sequence where:\nk1 maybe,\nk2 maybe,\nk3 maybe,\nk4 maybe,\n...\nWe see that some formulas hold: \nk5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 suggests that if we know k2 and k3, then k5 is computed by multiplication. But the comment \"(indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\" suggests this pattern might not hold for every index.\n\nThen they mention k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5. And check: k8 = 224, so k8 * 12 = 2688, minus 5 gives 2683 which is k12.\nSo f(12) would be computed from that? But then the general hypothesis is that sometimes the index appears in the formula as a multiplier.\n\nThe user wants to know: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nMaybe we have keys with indices 2,3,5,7,8,9,11,12? And maybe their corresponding values are: \nk2: unknown,\nk3: unknown,\nk5 = k2 * k3. But they haven't given explicit numbers except in checks.\n\nThey gave:\nk7=76,\nk8=224,\nk9=467,\nk11=1155,\nk12=2683.\nAnd maybe others like k? Possibly also k? \n\nLet me list the keys provided:\n\n- k2: not explicitly given, but used in formula \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\"\n- k3: similarly unknown.\n- k5: equals product of k2 and k3. But no numeric value is given for k5.\n\nThen check items:\n1. For n=7, k7=76\n2. For n=8, k8=224\n3. For n=9, k9=467\n4. For n=11, k11=1155\n5. For n=12, k12=2683 (from formula using k8)\n\nSo we have keys for indices 7,8,9,11,12 known.\n\nMaybe there is pattern: \nFor index 7: if k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then dividing by n gives f(7) plus g(n)/n. For k7=76, 76/7 \u2248 10.857... so not an integer.\nFor k8: 224/8 = 28 exactly, so that suggests f(8)=28 and probably g(8)=0.\nFor k9: 467/9 ~51.888..., not integer so f(9) is not integer\nFor k11: 1155/11=105 exactly, so f(11)=105 and presumably g(11)=0.\nFor k12: if we try to write it as f(12)*12 + g(12), then dividing by 12 gives f(12)+g(12)/12 = 223.5833... But we also have an alternative representation: k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5. And since k8=224, that equals (28*12) - 5 = 336-5=331? That doesn't match 2683 though; let me recalc:\n28*12 = 336, 336-5=331, not equal to 2683.\nWait I'm mistaken: Let's check k8 given: it said \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28\", so f(8)=28 and g(8)=0. And then they say \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". But note: if we set f(12)=? maybe it's not matching the pattern of multiplication by 12.\n\nWait, let's re-read that check:\n\"2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\"\nSo for n=8, f(8)=28.\nThen \"5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\" suggests that if we express k12 as something times 12 plus something, it doesn't yield an integer multiplier, but if you use the formula k12 = k8*12 - 5, then note k8 is known to be 28\u00d78, so maybe f(12)=? Let me try: If we assume that sometimes the index itself appears in the formula, perhaps for some indices f(n) equals something like a previous key's multiplier. For instance, they noticed k12 = k8 * 12 - 5, and since k8=28\u00d78, maybe then f(12)=28? But then 28*12=336, minus 5 gives 331 which is not equal to 2683. So that doesn't hold.\n\nMaybe there's a misprint in the user's text: \"k8 = 224/8 = 28\" is clear; and \"k11 = 1155/11 =105\" so f(11)=105.\nThen \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 =223.58...\" So if we try to express k12 in the form f(12)*12+g(12), then f(12) would be non-integer (223.5833...) but they also observed that it equals \"k8\u00d712 -5\". And since k8=224, that is 2688-5 = 2683 exactly.\nSo maybe the pattern is: sometimes the multiplier in front of n is taken from a previous key's multiplier. For example, f(12) might equal f(k8)? But then f(8)=28 but 28*12 would be 336 which is not 2683.\n\nWait, let me compute k8\u00d712 -5 exactly: k8=224; 224\u00d712 = 2688; minus 5 gives 2683. So that's the number for k12.\nNow if we try to express 2683 in form f(12)*12+g(12), then f(12)= ? Possibly if g(12) is not zero, maybe it fits a pattern with other keys.\n\nMaybe there is a sequence of keys: k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. And the hypothesis \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\" and we are supposed to compute f(n) for each key.\n\nWe have:\nFor n=7: f(7)=? since 76/7 is not integer; maybe it's the quotient when dividing by 7 plus a fractional part.\nFor n=8: f(8)=28 exactly, with g(8)=0.\nFor n=9: f(9) would be floor division of 467 by 9 = 51 remainder? Let me do: 9*51=459, remainder is 8. So k9=9*51+8, so f(9)=51 and g(9)=8.\nFor n=11: f(11)=1155/11 exactly equals 105, with g(11)=0.\nFor n=12: We have two representations: one as f(12)*12 + g(12) should equal 2683. If we solve for f(12) and g(12), it's not unique unless there is a pattern in the remainders/g(n). Possibly the idea is that sometimes f(n) equals k_m where m divides n? For instance, k8 appears as multiplier when expressing k12.\n\nMaybe the pattern: When the index is composite, say 12=3*4, maybe f(12) equals the sum of f's for its factors. But then we see k12 = k8\u00d712 -5. And since k8 corresponds to index 8? Wait, 12 and 8 share a factor of 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively: \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" might be interpreted as: given the hypothesis that k_n can be written in the form n * f(n) + g(n), determine what f(7), f(8), f(9), f(11), f(12) are, based on the values we know (k7=76, k8=224, etc). But for some keys, the division is not an integer so f(n) might be the quotient ignoring remainder.\n\nMaybe the intended answer: \nFor n=7, f(7)=floor(76/7)=10, remainder 6; For n=8, f(8)=28 exactly (since 224/8 = 28); for n=9, f(9)=51 with remainder 8 (467=9*51+8); for n=11, f(11)=105 exactly; for n=12, if we try to express it as 12*f(12) + g(12), then dividing gives f(12)=223 remainder? Let's compute: 12*223 = 2676, remainder 7. So k12 = 12*223+7.\nBut then note that they mentioned \"k8\u00d712 -5\". And if we compare that with the expression for k12 in terms of f(12) and g(12), maybe there is a relation: k12 = (f(8)*?) ... Actually, note that k8 was 28*8. So k8/8 = 28.\nMaybe the pattern is: sometimes f(n) equals k_(n-?)/? or something.\n\nLet's re-read \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" might be simpler: For a given n, f(n) is essentially k_n / n if k_n divides evenly by n. But here only for 8 and 11 it divides evenly. So maybe the answer: \nf(7)=76/7 (approx 10.857), f(8)=224/8=28, f(9)=467/9 (approx 51.8889), f(11)=1155/11=105, and f(12) can be represented as (k8\u00d712 -5)/12 = (2683/12) which is not an integer; however, if we want it in the form n*f(n)+g(n) with f(n) being a factor from some other key, maybe f(12)=28? But 28*12=336, no.\nAlternatively, maybe we are supposed to notice that f(11) = 105 is 3 times f(8)? Because 28 * 3.75 = 105. No.\n\nWait: Could it be that the indices correspond to something like \"Key of C\" etc in music? Possibly not.\n\nMaybe the idea: When k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then sometimes the function f(n) is given by a multiplication involving a previous key's index or multiplier. For example, k12 uses k8: 12 * (k8/8)? That would be 12*(28)=336, but then subtracting 5 gives 331, not 2683.\n\nWait recalc: \"k8=224\" so maybe f(8)=224/8=28. Then if we try to see a relation for k12: They claim that k12 = k8 * 12 - 5. But k8*12 is 224*12 = 2688, minus 5 equals 2683, which matches. So maybe the pattern is that sometimes f(n) (the multiplier part) can be expressed as a previous key's multiplier times n? For example, maybe f(12)=f(8)*? but then 28*? would equal something. If we solve for ? from k12: if k12 were given by (k8/8 * n)*n + g(n), that would be (28*12) =336, which is too low.\nMaybe instead the pattern is: sometimes the index itself appears as a multiplier in the formula rather than the quotient f(n). For instance, for key 11 we have k11=1155 and writing it as ? \u00d7 11 + ? gives an integer multiplier (105). And for key 12, if we write it as ? \u00d7 12 + ?, it doesn't give an integer multiplier. But then they note that using a previous key's value (k8) yields a neat expression: k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5.\n\nThis might be a puzzle or riddle where the keys are musical keys, and f(n) might represent something like \"the number of sharps\" in a key signature. For example, C major has 0 sharps/flats, G major has 1 sharp, D major has 2 sharps, A major has 3 sharps, E major has 4 sharps, B major has 5 sharps, F# major has 6 sharps, and so on. But then what are the numbers? \nk8 =224 maybe corresponds to \"G\" with 1 sharp, but 28 doesn't equal 1.\nAlternatively, maybe these keys correspond to the circle of fifths order or something.\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking: The question might simply be: given that sometimes you can express a key's value as n*f(n)+g(n), find f(n) for each known key. And the answer is:\n- For k7 (value 76): f(7)=10, because 7*10=70 and remainder 6.\n- For k8 (value 224): f(8)=28 exactly.\n- For k9 (value 467): f(9)=51, with a remainder of 8.\n- For k11 (value 1155): f(11)=105 exactly.\n- For k12 (value 2683): f(12) would be computed as ? Let's do division: 12 * 223 = 2676, remainder 7; so if we express it in the form 12*f(12)+g(12), then f(12)=223 and g(12)=7.\n\nBut then they mention \"k8\u00d712 -5\" for k12. Let's check: k8 is 224, times 12 = 2688, minus 5 equals 2683, so that fits.\nSo maybe the answer:\nf(7) = 76/7 (non-integer), f(8)=28, f(9)=467/9 (non-integer quotient), f(11)=105, and if we force k12 to have an integer multiplier by using k8's value, then f(12)=224? But that doesn't check because 12*224=2688, which is not 2683. \nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is: sometimes the \"f(n)\" part comes from a multiplication of a previous key's \"f\" value with n. For example, for k11 we have f(11)=105 and for k12, if you use k8, then 28*? But not sure.\n\nMaybe there is a recurrence relation where f(n) = (k_n - g(n))/n. And maybe the pattern observed: sometimes the index n appears as the multiplier in the expression of k_n. For instance, k11 = 105\u00d711, and k8=28\u00d78, so their multipliers are \"nice\". But for k7 and k9, they don't come out nicely.\n\nMaybe we have to answer: f(7)=76/7 \u2248 10.857, f(8)=224/8=28, f(9)=467/9\u224851.888, f(11)=1155/11=105, and f(12) from the expression k12=k8\u00d712 -5 gives: f(12)=? Let's see if we can express k12 as 12*f(12)+g(12). We have 2683 = 12*223 + 7. So one possibility is f(12)=223, g(12)=7.\n\nMaybe the intended answer: \nf(7) = 76/7,\nf(8) = 28,\nf(9) = 467/9,\nf(11) = 105,\nf(12) = 2683/12.\n\nBut that seems trivial: just divide k_n by n.\nUnless we are supposed to observe that f(8)=k8/8=28 and f(11)=1155/11=105, which might be related by the fact that 105 is (28*3.75) but not clear.\n\nWait, let me re-read: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly it means: For each key k_n, write it in the form n * f(n) + g(n), and then determine f(n). So I would say:\n\nFor k7=76:\nDivide 76 by 7. 7*10 =70, remainder 6. So f(7)=10 (if we want an integer part) or maybe f(7)=76/7 if we allow fractions.\nSimilarly for k9: 467 divided by 9 gives quotient 51 with remainder 8, so f(9)=51.\nFor k11: 1155 divided by 11 gives exactly 105, so f(11)=105.\nFor k12: 2683 divided by 12 gives quotient 223 with remainder 7, so f(12)=223.\n\nAnd for k8: 224/8=28, so f(8)=28.\n\nThen maybe we notice that f(8) appears in the expression for k12 if we subtract 5 and then divide by 12? Because 2683+5=2688, which is 12*224. And 224 = 8*28, but 28 is f(8). So indeed, 2688=12*(8*f(8)) so maybe there's a pattern: sometimes k_n can be factored as n * (m * f(m)) for some m dividing n.\n\nIn this case, k12 = k8\u00d712 -5. And note that k8 = 8f(8), and 12/8 simplifies to 3/2, so k12 would be (3/2)*8*f(8)*? That doesn't match well though.\nLet's try: 2688/12=224, so f(12)=224. But that contradicts our earlier division since 12*224=2688 not 2683.\n\nMaybe I'm misinterpreting \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" meaning that in the expression k_n = n * f(n) + g(n), sometimes you get a neat factor f(n). And indeed, for some keys, like k11 and k8, you do: f(11)=105 and f(8)=28. For others, like k7 and k9, they are messy fractions if you try to force an integer multiplier.\nThus the answer might be simply:\n\n- Key 7 (k_7): f(7) = 76/7 \u2248 10.857\n- Key 8 (k_8): f(8) = 224/8 = 28 exactly\n- Key 9 (k_9): f(9) = 467/9 \u2248 51.888\n- Key 11 (k_11): f(11) = 1155/11 = 105 exactly\n- Key 12 (k_12): f(12) can be derived from k_12 = k_8 * 12 - 5, so since k_8=224, then k_12 = 2688 - 5 = 2683. Dividing by 12 gives a non-integer: 2683/12 \u2248 223.583.\n\nBut wait the given expression \"k8\u00d712 -5\" already implies that f(12) might be taken as (k8\u00d712 -5)/12, which is exactly 224 - 5/12 = 224 - 0.4167 = 223.5833.\n\nMaybe the intended answer: \nf(7)=76/7,\nf(8)=28,\nf(9)=467/9,\nf(11)=105,\nf(12)=2683/12.\n\nBut that seems too trivial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are \"keys to a puzzle\", and the pattern is something like: The nice ones (like 8 and 11) have f(n) as whole numbers. And indeed, 28 and 105 are factors of some other numbers in the puzzle? For instance, 28 = 7 choose 2 or something? And 105 is 7*5*3 maybe?\n\nWait 105 = 7*15, not sure.\n\nMaybe I can try to factor these numbers:\n- f(8)=28 = 4*7\n- f(11)=105 = 7*15\nSo both contain a factor of 7? And f(7) was 76/7 which is roughly 10.857, not obviously related.\nf(9)=467/9 \u2248 51.888, and 467 is prime maybe?\nLet me check: 467 mod small primes: 467 mod 2 no; 3: 4+6+7=17, so no; 5: ends with 7 no; 7: 7*66 =462, remainder 5; 11: 11*42=462, remainder 5; 13: 13*35=455, remainder 12; 17: 17*27=459, remainder 8; 19: 19*24=456, remainder 11. So likely prime.\nf(12)=223 is also prime? Check 223 mod small primes: 7*31=217, remainder 6; 13*17=221, remainder 2; so yes.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that sometimes f(n) equals a prime number and sometimes not.\n\nI wonder if there's any context missing from the question. Possibly it's part of a puzzle \"Unlocking the keys\" where k_n = n * f(n) + g(n) and one must find f(n). \n\nGiven the limited data, I'll assume that the answer is simply: \nFor each key:\nk7 = 7*f(7)+g(7), so f(7)=76/7 if we insist on a rational number.\nk8 = 8*28 exactly, so f(8)=28.\nk9 = 9*f(9)+g(9) with f(9)=467/9.\nk11= 11*105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\nk12: It can be written as 12*(2683/12) but that doesn't simplify nicely; however, using the relation k8\u00d712 -5 gives a clue that perhaps we want to express it in terms of f(8). Since k8=8*28, then k8\u00d712 = (8*28)*12 = 8*28*12. Dividing by 12 gives 8*28 =224. So one might be tempted to say f(12)=224, but that would give 12*224 =2688, which is off by 5.\n\nMaybe the intended interpretation: The nice ones are when the key number divides k_n evenly. That happens for n=8 and n=11. In those cases, f(n) is an integer (28 and 105 respectively). For other keys like 7,9,12, there's a remainder.\n\nThus answer:\nf(7)=76/7, \nf(8)=28,\nf(9)=467/9, \nf(11)=105, \nand f(12) = (k8\u00d712 -5)/12 = (2683)/12 which is not an integer. \n\nI can express them as:\nf(7)=76/7 \u224810.857,\nf(8)=28,\nf(9)=467/9 \u224851.889,\nf(11)=105,\nf(12)\u2248223.583.\n\nMaybe I should simplify fractions if possible: \n76/7 is irreducible.\n467/9 doesn't simplify (since 467 mod 3= 4+6+7=17, not divisible by 3).\n2683/12 is irreducible since 2683 mod 2 =1, mod3 gives sum digits=19 so no.\n\nThus the answer.\n\nI worry that I'm missing a pattern: \"Sometimes you'll see the index itself appear in your f(n) factor. For example, k11=105\u00d711 and k8=28\u00d78. But then sometimes it doesn't, such as with 7,9,12.\" Possibly the answer is to notice which keys have f(n) that is an integer.\n\nThus final answer: \n- f(7)=76/7\n- f(8)=224/8 = 28\n- f(9)=467/9\n- f(11)=1155/11 =105\n- f(12)=2683/12 (or equivalently, using k8\u00d712 -5, we get f(12) = 224 - 5/12)\n\nI might express it as: \nf(n) = (k_n - g(n))/n. For the keys given:\nFor key 7: since k_7=76 and 76 = 7*10 +6, so f(7)=10.\nFor key 8: 224=8*28 so f(8)=28.\nFor key 9: 467=9*51+8, so f(9)=51.\nFor key 11: 1155=11*105 so f(11)=105.\nFor key 12: if we set k_12 = k_8\u00d712 -5, then since k_8=224, we get 2683=12*f(12)+g(12), and solving gives f(12)=223 (if you assume g(12)=7) or more precisely, f(12)= (2683-7)/12 =223.\nWait: Let me re-check that possibility: if I force a remainder such that the multiplier is an integer: 12*223=2676 and then plus remainder 7 gives 2683. So maybe the intended answer for key 12 is f(12)=223.\n\nSimilarly, for key 7: maybe they expect f(7) to be 10 if we take the quotient (ignoring the fractional part). And for key 9: f(9)=51.\nThat might be the intention: sometimes the formula k_n = n * f(n) + g(n) is meant to isolate an integer multiplier f(n) and a remainder g(n), so f(n) is actually the \"floor\" of (k_n)/n. Then we have:\nFor key 7, floor(76/7)=10.\nFor key 8, floor(224/8)=28 exactly.\nFor key 9, floor(467/9)=51.\nFor key 11, floor(1155/11)=105.\nFor key 12, floor(2683/12)=223.\n\nThat seems more plausible: f(n) is the quotient when dividing k_n by n. And note that sometimes k_n/n is an integer (like for 8 and 11), and sometimes not (like for 7,9,12).\n\nThus final answer: \nf(7) = 10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and f(12)=223.\n\nAnd the remainders are g(7)=6, g(8)=0, g(9)=8, g(11)=0, g(12)=7.\nThat is likely what they want.\n\nI'll answer: \nThe keys k_n satisfy k_n = n * f(n) + g(n). For key 7, 76 = 7*10+6 so f(7)=10; for key 8, 224=8*28+0 so f(8)=28; for key 9, 467=9*51+8 so f(9)=51; for key 11, 1155=11*105+0 so f(11)=105; and for key 12 (which also equals k_8\u00d712 -5), we have 2683=12*223+7, so f(12)=223.\n\nI'll now produce the final answer accordingly.</think>We are told that each \u201ckey\u201d k\u2099 can be written in the form\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = n\u00b7f(n) + g(n).\n\nIn many cases (and in particular for some of the keys below) the division is exact so that f(n) is an integer; when it isn\u2019t, one may think of f(n) as the \u201cquotient\u201d and g(n) as the remainder.
