There are keys: k5, k12, k7, k8, k9, k11, etc, and formulas involving them.\n\nIt is about pattern analysis of index product pattern. I need to compute f(n) for each key from the text. Let me re-read carefully:\n\nWe have something like: \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\".\n\nThe observed observations:\n\n- \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\" That is ambiguous because it says \"product 5\u00d7?\".\n\nWait, check the text carefully:\n```\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n```\nThis likely means: The key with index 5 might be equal to the product of keys with indices 2 and 3. But then it writes \"product 5\u00d7?\" which is not clear.\n\nMaybe the intended relation was something like k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) maybe for some n?\n\nThen next:\n- \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\" So this indicates that key with index 12 equals k8 times 12 minus 5.\n\nNext, hypothesis: \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\"\nCHECK:\n\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo far, for keys: \nk8: formula: 28 * 8\nk11: formula: 105 * 11\n\nWait, how did we get these? The check lines say:\nFor key 7: 76/7 = 10.86 (not integer)\nKey 8: 224/8 = 28 exactly integer.\nKey 9: 467/9 is not an integer.\nKey 11: 1155/11 gives 105 exactly integer.\nk12: 2683/12 is not an integer, but k8*12 - 5 equals 2683. So that is a pattern.\n\nThe question is \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nI need to interpret what the user expects as answer: I'm assuming we need to find if there is some consistent function f(n) such that keys (given some keys, maybe from k2 up to ...?) satisfy a formula k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). But we only see examples. Possibly the \"f(n)\" values are something like for n=8: 28, and for n=11: 105. And maybe there is relation with indices? Let's try to decipher potential pattern from given keys:\n\nWe have:\nk2, k3, ... not sure what they are.\n\nThe observed formulas:\n- \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" suggests that product of keys at indices 2 and 3 equals key 5. But then it says (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no). Possibly misprint: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\", but then \"product 5\u00d7?\" might be a reference to something else.\n\nThen \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\". That is explicit. So if we denote f(n) for n=12, maybe it's computed from k8. But the text says: \"So k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711.\" So that means:\nFor key index 8, f(8)=? Possibly, using formula \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\", if we solve for f(n) when g(n)=0 maybe. But not sure.\n\nWait: Check line #2: \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713\". That is interesting, they say \"224/8 = 28\" and note that equals \"k8/8\", so f(8)=28 if g(n) were 0. But not sure.\n\nLine #4: \"k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\", then they conclude k11=105\u00d711, so f(11)=105 if there is no additive constant.\n\nThen line #5: \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". That means that for key index 12, the formula might be interpreted as k12 = (k8)*12 - 5, so f(12)=? Possibly: if we write k12 in form f(12) * 12 + g(12), then f(12) would equal k8? Let's solve: If k8=28 and k12 = 2683, then 28\u00d712 =336, but that is not matching. Wait recalc: \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28\" so they say \"28 = k8/8\", meaning k8 equals 224? Let me re-read: \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28\". Possibly it means that if you divide 224 by 8, you get 28, which is exactly f(8). And similarly for key 11: 1155/11 =105.\n\nSo we have:\nk2 = unknown? k3 = unknown?\nWe know k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. So maybe f(5) can be computed if we know something about k2 and k3? But then \"product 5\u00d7?\" is ambiguous. Possibly they mean that the indices multiplied: For key 5, the factors are keys at index 2 and 3.\n\nMaybe the pattern is: for composite indices (like 6=2*3 or maybe not), f(n) equals something like product of some prime factors? But then the hypothesis \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\" suggests that we have a linear function in n, plus an additive constant. And they want to calculate f(n) for each key.\n\nI should check what keys are available: indices 5,7,8,9,11,12 maybe others.\n\nWe have data:\nFor k2 and k3, no numerical values given. But we know product relation: k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. So if we assume that k2 = f(2)*2 + g(2) and k3= f(3)*3 + g(3), then maybe we can deduce something? However, the question says \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly the answer is to compute these f-values from given data: For key 8, f(8)=28; for key 11, f(11)=105. But what about keys 5,7,9,12?\n\nWait, check lines:\nLine 1: k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean). So that means if we attempt to express k7 in the form f(7)*7 + g(7), then the quotient 76/7 is not an integer.\nLine 2: k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? gives result 224/8 =28, so presumably f(8)=28 (if g=0).\nLine 3: k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 =51.89 (not clean)\nLine 4: k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? gives 1155/11=105, so likely f(11)=105.\nLine 5: k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 \u2248223.58 (not integer), but note that if we use formula k8\u00d712 -5 then it equals 2683 exactly.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: sometimes you have a linear form with additive constant zero, and sometimes an extra term. The hypothesis is \"sometimes the index itself appears in the formula.\" For instance, for key 12, the formula becomes k12 = (k8)*12 -5. So f(12) might equal k8, which is 28, but then times n gives 28\u00d712=336, and then minus 5 equals 331, not 2683. Wait, check: 28 * 12 =336, subtract 5 equals 331. That doesn't match 2683. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nMaybe the text \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" means that if we try to write k8 in a linear form with n=8, then dividing 224 by 8 gives 28 exactly. And similarly for k11: 1155/11 =105 exactly. So f(8)=28 and f(11)=105.\nFor k12: Trying the division 2683/12 is not an integer (223.583...), but we observe that k12 can be expressed as (k8\u00d712 - 5). And since k8 equals 224? Wait, let me re-read: \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 =28 = k8/8 \u2713\" suggests that the linear decomposition of k8 yields a quotient f(8)=28. For k11, similarly it's 1155/11=105. And for k12 we note \"k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5\", so that means k12 equals (f(8)*8?) No, wait:\n\nWe have: k8 seems to be computed as ? \u00d7 8 + ?; the quotient when dividing by 8 is exactly f(n) if there's no remainder. For key 8, it's clean.\n\nFor key 11: it's also clean division giving an integer.\nFor key 12: direct linear form doesn't yield an integer f(12). But k12 can be expressed as k8 * 12 - 5. And we know k8 equals something computed earlier. But if I substitute, what do we get? k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? such that when divided by 8 gives 28. So maybe k8=224.\n\nThen k12 would equal 224\u00d712 - 5 = 2688 - 5 = 2683 which matches the given value.\nSo then if k8 = 224, then f(8)=? Well, in the linear decomposition for key 8, they wrote \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" and computed 224/8=28. So likely f(8)=28.\n\nFor key 11: similarly, k11 is given by some value that divides evenly by 11 to yield 105, so f(11)=105.\nThen maybe we can compute f(n) for other indices if they follow a pattern. The question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" might be interpreted as: For each n in {5,7,8,9,11,12}, what is the quotient when k_n is expressed as something times n plus an additive term? Possibly f(5) from k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 but we don't have explicit values for k2 and k3. Wait a minute.\n\nMaybe I should re-read the text with fresh eyes:\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n\nIs there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)?\n\nCalculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nIt seems the user is providing some observed numbers for keys: \nk7 = 76 (so k7=76)\nk8 = 224\nk9 = 467\nk11 = 1155\nk12 = 2683\n\nAnd they've computed:\n- For n=7, if we divide 76 by 7, we get approximately 10.8571, so not an integer.\n- For n=8, dividing 224 by 8 yields exactly 28.\n- For n=9, dividing 467 by 9 gives approx 51.888...\n- For n=11, dividing 1155 by 11 yields exactly 105.\n- For n=12, dividing 2683 by 12 is not an integer.\n\nSo then it suggests that for some indices (like 8 and 11) the quotient when dividing k_n by n is an integer, which we denote as f(n). So f(8)=28, f(11)=105. And perhaps one can compute f(n) for others if they are supposed to be integers.\n\nMaybe there's a pattern: maybe f(n) = something like binomial coefficients or factorial numbers? For instance, 28 and 105 appear in combinatorics (C(8,2)? No, C(8,2)=28; C(11,2)=55 but not 105; actually 105 is C(15,2)?) Wait, 105 is 5 choose something? Let's see: 28 = binom{8}{2} or maybe binom{7}{2}=21. Actually, let me check: 28 equals 4*7? It could be triangular numbers: The triangular number for 7 is 28. Yes! 28 is the 7th triangular number (1+2+3+...+7 = 28). And 105 is the 14th triangular number divided by something maybe not exactly.\n\nWait, 28 and 105: 28 is T(7)=28; 105 is T(14)=105. That might be a coincidence: f(8) equals triangular number of (n-1), i.e., T(7) for n=8. And f(11) equals T(10)=55, but 55 is not 105. Wait recalc: Triangular numbers:\nT(n) = n(n+1)/2.\nFor n=7, T(7)=28; for n=10, T(10)=55; for n=14, T(14)=105.\nSo f(8) might equal T(7)=28. And maybe f(11)=? 1155/11=105, which is T(14). But then why would the triangular number index be different from (n-1)? For n=8, it's 7; for n=11, it's 14; perhaps there's a pattern: f(n) equals some triangular number of something that depends on n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(n) equals binom(n+something choose 2). Let me check:\nFor n=7, if we want an integer quotient then k_n must be divisible by n. The numbers given are not all divisible by their indices except for n=8 and n=11. \nLet's list them: k5 = ? It might be computed as product of keys? \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" but we don't have values for k2 and k3.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that when index is prime, then f(n) is an integer, and when composite or something else, not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these numbers come from a known sequence. 224, 467, 1155, 2683 look like they might be part of some OEIS sequence? Let me check differences:\nk7=76, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, k12=2683.\nDifferences: 224-76 =148; 467-224=243; then gap from 7 to 9 is skipping 10. Not sure.\n\nMaybe I can try expressing them in terms of triangular numbers:\nFor k8=224, if f(8)=28, then maybe g(8)=0.\nFor k11=1155, dividing by 11 gives exactly 105, so f(11)=105 and g(11)=0.\nThen what about k7? If we try to express it as 7*f + g, we want f and g to be perhaps from the same pattern. For n=7: if we set f(7) = T(n-1) for some reason, then T(6)=21, but 7*21=147 which is too high; or maybe f(7)=? 76/7 approximates 10.857, not an integer.\nFor k9, 467/9 \u224851.888, so no.\n\nMaybe the idea is: sometimes when you divide by n, you get a whole number (f(n)), and sometimes not. The question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" might be asking to compute those quotients that are integers, i.g., for keys 8 and 11, we have f(8)=28 and f(11)=105.\n\nMaybe the answer: \nFor n=5, since k5 is defined as product of keys 2 and 3, if we assume keys 2 and 3 follow a similar pattern, then maybe k2 = something and k3 = something. But no numbers given.\nFor key 7, f(7) would be the quotient of 76 divided by 7 which is not an integer, so maybe it's defined as floor division? 76/7=10 remainder 6, so f(7)=10? Or perhaps we define f(n) only when it divides evenly.\n\nThe hypothesis \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\" suggests that for each key n, if you divide k_n by n, the quotient is f(n) and the remainder is g(n). So then what are these quotients? They are: \nFor n=7, 76/7 gives quotient 10 (since integer division 7*10 =70 with remainder 6), so maybe f(7)=10.\nFor n=8, 224/8 yields quotient 28 exactly, so f(8)=28 and g(8)=0.\nFor n=9, 467/9 gives quotient 51 (because 9*51=459, remainder 8), so f(9)=51.\nFor n=11, 1155/11 yields quotient 105 exactly, so f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\nFor n=12, 2683/12 gives quotient 223 (since 12*223 =2676, remainder 7) but note the alternative expression k12=k8\u00d712 -5 means that if you divide 2683 by 12, you get a non-integer quotient.\n\nLet me check: 224 * 12 = 2688. 2688 - 5=2683, so when dividing 2683 by 12, the quotient would be floor division 223 and remainder 7 (because 12*223=2676, plus remainder 7 equals 2683). So then f(12)=223.\n\nSo maybe we have:\nn:   k_n     Division result (f(n) = floor(k_n/n), g(n) = remainder)\n5:   unknown? We only know relation: k5 = k2 * k3. No numeric value given.\n7:   76 \u2192 quotient 10, remainder 6. So f(7)=10.\n8:   224 \u2192 quotient 28, remainder 0. So f(8)=28.\n9:   467 \u2192 quotient 51, remainder 8. So f(9)=51.\n11: 1155 \u2192 quotient 105, remainder 0. So f(11)=105.\n12: 2683 \u2192 quotient 223, remainder 7 (if using floor division), but note that there's an alternative expression.\n\nNow then what about k2 and k3? They are not given explicitly. But maybe we can infer them from the relation with k5 if k5 is known? Not enough info.\n\nMaybe the pattern of f(n) for n=7,8,9,11,12 is:\nf(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, f(12)=223.\nDo these numbers have a pattern?\nDifferences: 28-10 =18; 51-28=23; 105-51=54; 223-105=118. Not obvious.\n\nMaybe they relate to triangular numbers? f(8) equals T7 (1+2+...+7 =28). f(11)=105, which is T14? But then f(7)=10, but T6=21, T5=15; so no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are related to something like: f(n) = round(k_n/n)? Not sure.\n\nLet's consider if the intended pattern is that sometimes k_n can be represented exactly as a multiple of n (i.e., g(n)=0), and sometimes not. The ones with exact division are for n=8 and n=11, which correspond to 28 and 105 respectively.\nAnd then maybe f(7)=floor(76/7)=10, f(9)=floor(467/9)=51, and f(12)=floor(2683/12)=223.\nSo perhaps the answer is: f(7) = 10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, f(12)=223.\n\nBut then what about k5? Possibly we can infer it from \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\". If we assume that k2 and k3 are given by similar linear forms: maybe k2 = f(2)*2 + g(2) and k3 = f(3)*3 + g(3). But without further data, not possible.\n\nMaybe the question is incomplete. The user says \"calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly the answer should be a table:\n\nn    k_n   f(n)= quotient when dividing by n\n5    ?     ?\n7    76    10 (if integer division)\n8    224   28\n9    467   51\n11   1155  105\n12   2683  223\n\nBut then what about k2 and k3? Possibly we need to compute them from the relation k5 = k2 * k3, but we don't know their linear forms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hypothesis is that for each key n there exist functions f(n) and g(n) such that k_n = n*f(n) + g(n), and then they want to find a closed form for f(n). For n=8 and 11, it's exact: f(8)=28, f(11)=105. And maybe these numbers come from some sequence like f(n) = (n+? choose ?).\n\n28 is the 7th triangular number; 105 is the 14th triangular number; maybe then for n=12, if we try to see a pattern: f(8)=T(7), f(11)=T(?). But 105 is T(14) = 14*15/2 =105. So maybe there's a relation f(n) = T(something) where something depends on n.\n\nMaybe I'll assume that the intended answer is simply:\n\nFor key 7: k_7 = 76, so f(7)=10 (since 76=7\u00d710+6).\nFor key 8: k_8 = 224, so f(8)=28.\nFor key 9: k_9 = 467, so f(9)=51.\nFor key 11: k_11 = 1155, so f(11)=105.\nFor key 12: k_12 = 2683, so f(12)=223.\n\nThen also note that sometimes the pattern includes the index n explicitly in the formula for k_n (like in k_12 = k_8 * 12 - 5).\n\nThus my answer could be:\n\nThe function f(n) is defined by writing k_n = n*f(n) + g(n). Based on the observed values:\n- For n=7, k_7 = 76 gives f(7)=10 and remainder 6.\n- For n=8, k_8 = 224 yields an exact multiple: f(8)=28 (and g(8)=0).\n- For n=9, k_9 = 467 gives f(9)=51 with a remainder of 8.\n- For n=11, k_11 = 1155 gives f(11)=105 exactly (g(11)=0).\n- For n=12, k_12 = 2683 yields f(12)=223 and remainder 7.\n\nAlso, note the relation k_12 = k_8 * 12 - 5 indicates that sometimes k_n involves other keys in its definition.\n\nThus answer: f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, f(12)=223.\n\nI'll provide a clear explanation.</think>We will show one acceptable way to \u201cread\u2010off\u201d the functions f(n) and g(n) from the identities\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = n\u00b7f(n) + g(n)\n\nonce you know some numerical values for k\u2099. (In what follows we assume that when a division is not exact we define f(n) to be the quotient obtained by \u201cinteger\u2010division\u201d of k\u2099 by n; note that in other contexts one might instead work with fractional parts.) \n\nFor example, suppose that you know\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2087 = 76,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2088 = 224,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2089 = 467,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 1155, and\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 2683.\n\nThen writing k\u2099 in the form\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = n\u00b7f(n) + g(n)\n\nwe may \u201cread\u2010off\u201d f(n) as follows:\n\n\u2022 For n = 7 we have\n\u2003\u200376 = 7 \u00b7 f(7) + g(7).\nDividing 76 by 7 gives 10 with remainder 6. That is,\n\u2003\u2003f(7) = 10\u2003\u2003and\u2003g(7) = 6.\n\n\u2022 For n = 8 we have\n\u2003\u2003224 = 8 \u00b7 f(8) + g(8).\nSince 224 divided by 8 is exactly 28, we get\n\u2003\u2003f(8) = 28\u2003\u2003and\u2003g(8) = 0.\n\n\u2022 For n = 9 we have\n\u2003\u2003467 = 9 \u00b7 f(9) + g(9).\nDividing 467 by 9 gives 51 with remainder 8 (because 9\u00d751 = 459 and 467 \u2013 459 = 8). Thus,\n\u2003\u2003f(9) = 51\u2003\u2003and\u2003g(9) = 8.\n\n\u2022 For n = 11 we have\n\u2003\u20031155 = 11 \u00b7 f(11) + g(11).\nSince 1155 divided by 11 is exactly 105 (because 11\u00d7105 = 1155), we obtain\n\u2003\u2003f(11) = 105\u2003\u2003and\u2003g(11) = 0.\n\n\u2022 For n = 12 we have\n\u2003\u20032683 = 12 \u00b7 f(12) + g(12).\nDividing 2683 by 12 gives 223 with remainder 7 (since 12\u00d7223 = 2676 and 2683 \u2013 2676 = 7). That is,\n\u2003\u2003f(12) = 223\u2003\u2003and\u2003g(12) = 7.\n\nThere is one additional relation given by the problem, namely\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = k\u2088\u00b712 \u2212 5.\nNotice that if you compute 224\u00d712 \u2013 5 you get\n\u2003\u20032688 \u2212 5 = 2683,\nso this is just another way of writing k\u2081\u2082. (It shows that sometimes the formulas for the keys involve other keys.)\n\nThus one acceptable answer is to list the values as follows:\n\n\u2003\u2003f(7) = 10,\u2003f(8) = 28,\u2003f(9) = 51,\u2003f(11) = 105,\u2003and\u2003f(12) = 223.\n\nAny answer that shows how to recover f(n) from the identities\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = n\u00b7f(n) + g(n)\nby \u201cdividing out\u201d the factor of n is correct. (In our case we have chosen to take the quotient as the integer part of k\u2099/n.) \n\nThis completes one acceptable solution.",
