Possibly there's a pattern with keys \"k?\" where maybe index n. The statement \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\" suggests that we have keys labeled as k2, k3, k5 etc.\n\nWe see \"HYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula\". \"CHECK:\" then list:\n\n- k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n- k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713\n- k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n- k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n- k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo they show that sometimes the index appears in a formula.\n\nNow we want to \"calculate f(n) for each key\" i.e. determine function f(n) where presumably k_n = f(n)*n + g(n).\n\nWe have data points: from check: \nk8: 224/8 = 28, so f(8)=? Possibly f(8)=? If we set k8=28\u00d78+? then maybe it's just f(8)=28 and g(8)=0.\n\nFor k11: 1155/11 = 105, so f(11)=? Likely f(11) = 105 if the pattern holds (since remainder is zero). But they mention that sometimes the index appears in formula. We see also \"k12\" with alternative representation: k8\u00d712 -5=2683. So maybe there's a piecewise definition?\n\nWait, check the given text: \"OBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\n\nIt appears that in the cases where division yields an integer, f(n) is just that quotient: for n=8, k8/8=28 => f(8)=28; and for n=11, k11/11=105 => f(11)=105. For others like 7,9,12, we get non-integer divisions.\n\nThen question: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nSo the keys are k2, k3, maybe k? The provided data: k5 equals product of k2 and k3? Let\u2019s re-read text:\n\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\n\nSo keys: \nk2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12 are mentioned.\nAnd there's also k? \"k2 \u00d7 k3\" gives product equals ? But then k8 is used in the formula for k12.\n\nMaybe we have a sequence of keys: k1, k2, ... and each key has some number associated. The text gives numerical values:\n- For k7: 76 (so k7=76)\n- For k8: 224 (so k8 =224)\n- For k9: 467 (k9=467)\n- For k11: 1155 (k11=1155)\n- For k12: 2683 (k12=2683)\n\nWe also have \"k2\", \"k3\", \"k5\" are mentioned but not given numerical values? However, the text \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" implies that if we know k2 and k3 then their product equals k5. So maybe we can compute f(n) for these keys as well.\n\nWe want to calculate f(n) for each key in form: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). The hypothesis is that sometimes the index itself appears explicitly (like multiplying by n), so maybe f(n)=some integer for certain indices, and otherwise there's no clean factorization.\n\nFrom data:\n- For n=7, 76/7 \u2248 10.8571... which isn't an integer, so we can try to express k7 as: k7 = f(7)*7 + g(7) where f(7) is not necessarily the quotient if there's a remainder.\nWe want \"f(n)\" for each key. Possibly it means compute floor division or something? \nMaybe it's like: f(n)= k_n // n, i.e., integer part of (k_n / n). For those indices where k_n is divisible by n exactly, then that quotient is f(n) and g(n)=0.\n\nSo for:\n- k7 = 76. Dividing 76 by 7 gives 10 remainder 6. So maybe f(7)=10.\n- k8 = 224. Dividing 224 by 8 gives 28 exactly, so f(8)=28.\n- k9 = 467. Dividing 467 by 9: 9*51=459 with remainder 8, so f(9)=51.\n- k11 = 1155. Dividing 1155 by 11: 11*105 =1155 exactly, so f(11)=105.\n- k12 = 2683. Dividing 2683 by 12 gives quotient 223 with remainder something? Let's compute: 12 *223=2676, remainder is 7, but also we have alternative representation: k8\u00d712 -5=224*12 -5=2688 -5=2683. So f(12) might be computed as (k12 + ?)/12 maybe not.\n\nWait, if k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then for n=12, we want to see if there is an integer quotient: 2683/12 =223 remainder? Let's compute: 12*223 = 2676, remainder 7. So f(12)=223 and g(12)=7.\n\nNow what about the ones with product patterns:\n- k2: unknown value maybe?\n- k3: unknown\n- k5: given that k5 = k2 * k3.\nWe need to compute f(n) for each key. Perhaps we have more known keys than just these? The text \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\" might be part of a puzzle where keys are being computed in some recurrence relation.\n\nMaybe the keys are defined by: k_n = n * (f(n)) + g(n), and sometimes there's an index-based factor. The examples:\nk8: 224/8=28, so f(8)=28.\nk11: 1155/11=105, so f(11)=105.\nFor k12: they tried to compute f(12) by dividing 2683/12 which gave non-integer result (223.58), but then note that k8 * 12 - 5 = 224*12 - 5 = 2683. So maybe that means for n=12, f(12)=k8? That is interesting: if we set k12 = (k8)*12 - 5, then f(12) would be equal to k8 which is 28, but that doesn't match because 28*12 would give 336, not 2683.\n\nLet's try re-read carefully:\n\n\"OBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\"\n\nSo maybe each key is computed from previous keys sometimes. There's a pattern: \"k_n = f(n) * n + g(n)\". We want to calculate f(n) for each key, likely using the division operation.\n\nFor n=7: k7=76, so 76/7 gives quotient 10 remainder 6, so f(7)=10.\nFor n=8: k8=224, so quotient is 28 exactly, so f(8)=28.\nFor n=9: k9=467, quotient: floor division? 467/9 = 51 with remainder 8, so f(9)=51.\nFor n=11: k11=1155, quotient: 1155/11 =105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\nFor n=12: k12=2683, quotient is not integer. But then they mention \"k8\u00d712-5\" equals 2683. That might be a way to express it in terms of the index (12 appears). So maybe for n=12, we can write f(12) =? Possibly 224/ ? Wait let's see:\n\nWe have expression: k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5.\nNow if k12 is expressed as f(12)*12 + g(12), then equate:\nf(12)*12 + g(12) = k8*12 - 5.\nWe already know that k8=224, so k8*12=2688. So then: f(12)*12 + g(12)=2688-5=2683.\n\nWe want to see if there's an integer quotient: Let f(12)=? If we divide 2683 by 12 we get remainder 7 as computed earlier, so one possibility is f(12)=223 and g(12)=7. But maybe that doesn't match the pattern \"sometimes the index appears\" because then you have a formula with n in it: k8*12-5. Perhaps they want to compare f(n) from these representations:\nFor n=8, we see f(8)=28 (from direct division).\nFor n=11, we see f(11)=105.\nFor n=7 and 9, not so nice.\n\nMaybe the pattern is: if k_n mod n ==0 then f(n) = k_n / n. Otherwise, perhaps f(n) can be expressed in terms of another key's value multiplied by n or something? For instance, k12 was computed as k8*12 -5, so maybe there is a pattern: when the division isn't clean, we might express it as k_(something)*n + constant.\n\nThe hypothesis \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula\" might mean that sometimes f(n) equals one of the earlier keys' values. For example, for n=12, they used k8*12 -5. That suggests that maybe f(12)=k8 which is 224, but then multiplied by 12 would be huge.\n\nWait, re-read: \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\". So if we try to write it as \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ?\" then one natural candidate for the multiplier is k8. But then that representation would be k12 = (k8)*12 + (-5). Then f(12)=k8, but g(12)=-5.\nNow compare with k11: k11=1155 and if we try to represent it as \"? \u00d7 11 + ?\" maybe the natural candidate is k? But they said \"k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 =105 (integer!)\" So then f(11)=105.\n\nSo what are the values of these keys? We have:\nk7 = 76, so f(7) from direct division: 76//7 = 10 remainder 6. But maybe we want to compute f(n) as floor(k_n/n)? The statement \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" suggests that f(n)= integer part of (k_n / n) if it divides evenly, and otherwise possibly something else.\n\nFor k2: We don't have explicit value but from \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\", maybe we can deduce some values if we assume a pattern? Possibly the keys are computed using their indices. Perhaps f(n)= something like Fibonacci numbers or something? Check: f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105. The differences: 10 to 28 is +18, then 28 to 51 is +23, then 51 to 105 is +54. Not obviously pattern.\n\nMaybe the keys are something like prime numbers? But k5= ? or maybe they represent composite numbers?\n\nWait \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\" might be a puzzle where each key k_n is defined as: k_n = n*(a function of n) + (some correction term). They ask \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nMaybe the keys are given by an underlying formula like:\nk_n = { \n  if n=2,3 then some base values,\n  if n=5 then product of k2 and k3,\n  if n=7 then something,\n  if n=8 then something,\n  etc.\n}\n\nI have to check the numbers we see: \nk7 = 76\nk8 = 224\nk9 = 467\nk11 = 1155\nk12 = 2683\n\nMaybe there is a pattern in these values relative to their indices. Let\u2019s compute k_n / n and its remainder:\nFor n=7, 76/7 gives quotient 10 with remainder 6.\nFor n=8, 224/8 gives quotient 28 exactly (so no remainder).\nFor n=9, 467/9 gives quotient 51 remainder 8. \nFor n=11, 1155/11 =105 exactly (no remainder).\nFor n=12, 2683/12 gives quotient 223 remainder 7.\n\nMaybe f(n) is the integer part of k_n / n? That would yield: f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, f(12)=223.\n\nBut then what about the others mentioned like k2 and k3 and k5. We have relation: k5 = k2 * k3.\nWe don't know values of k2 and k3 though? But maybe they are base cases in a sequence like:\nk1, k2,... Possibly it's similar to \"Look-and-say\" or some multiplicative pattern.\n\nI note that 224 (for k8) is 28*8 exactly, so f(8)=28.\n1155 for k11 is 105 * 11 exactly, so f(11)=105.\nk12 = 2683 can be represented as (k8)*12 -5, which gives a multiplier of 224 if we factor 12? Let's check: 224*12=2688. Then minus 5 equals 2683. So that representation is k12 = (k8)*12 + (-5). So then f(12)=k8=224 and g(12)=-5.\nNow, what about k7 and k9? \nMaybe k9 could be represented as something like k? Possibly k? We can try to see if there's a pattern:\nFor k8: f(8)=28. For k11: f(11)=105. The ratio 105/28 is 3.75, not integer.\nFor k7: f(7)=10, for k9: f(9)=51. The difference 41. \nMaybe the keys are given by a recurrence like: k_n = k_{n-1} + something * n? Let's check differences:\nBetween k7 and k8: 224 -76=148.\nBetween k8 and k9: 467 -224=243.\nBetween k9 and k11 (skipping k10 maybe): 1155 -467=688. Not clear.\n\nMaybe the intended answer is simply to compute f(n) = floor(k_n / n) for each given key:\nThus:\nf(2) = ?; f(3)=?; f(5)=?; f(7)=10; f(8)=28; f(9)=51; f(11)=105; f(12)=223.\nBut then what are k2, k3, and k5?\nWe know k5 = k2 * k3. Possibly base values: maybe k2=2 and k3=3? Then k5 would be 6, but that doesn't match the pattern because other keys are larger than their indices.\n\nMaybe we try to guess: if k8=224, then f(8)=28, which is much larger than 8. Perhaps these are factorial numbers or something like that.\nMaybe it's a puzzle about \"Index Product Puzzle\" where each key k_n is computed by multiplying its index with the previous key or adding a constant.\n\nI recall puzzles such as: \"Find the pattern in these keys: 4, 6, 11, 20, ...\" But here numbers are: k2 might be something like 2? k3 maybe 3? then k5 = 2*3=6. Then k7 = ? but we have k7=76 which is huge relative to its index.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the keys come from a phone keypad multiplication puzzle. \"INDEX PRODUCT\" might refer to the fact that for each key n on a phone, if you multiply it by something, you get another number.\n\nI need to re-read the original text: \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\". It says:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2 and 3, product gives index 5, but note \"5\u00d7? no\")\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (here the index 12 appears explicitly)\n\nMaybe each key's value is determined by an operation involving its index. And sometimes the formula involves a multiplication by the index. \nFor example, k11: 1155 can be factored as 105 * 11, so it fits the pattern k_n = f(n)*n with f(11)=105.\nk8 similarly.\n\nMaybe for those that don't divide evenly (like k7 and k9), we express them in a similar form but then note that there's a remainder. And maybe sometimes you can represent that remainder in terms of another key, like k12 was represented as k8*12 -5, which suggests f(12)=k8.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is to list:\nFor n=2: k2 = ? (we don't know, maybe it's given by a pattern from earlier keys)\nFor n=3: k3 = ?\nFor n=5: k5 = k2 * k3.\nFor n=7: f(7) = 10 since 76 = 10*7 +6.\nFor n=8: f(8)=28 because 224 = 28*8.\nFor n=9: f(9)=51 because 467 = 51*9 +8.\nFor n=11: f(11)=105 because 1155 = 105*11.\nFor n=12: f(12)=223 if taken directly, but alternatively represented as k8 (which is 224) * 12 -5 gives a decomposition with multiplier 224? Let's check that representation:\nIf we write k12 = 224*12 -5 then the coefficient of 12 would be 224 and the constant term would be -5. But that doesn't match the form f(12)*12 + g(12) unless f(12)=224 and g(12)=-5, but 224*12=2688, not 2683.\nWait recalc: k8 =224, so if we multiply by 12, we get 2688, subtract 5 yields 2683 which is k12. So that representation is valid: k12 = (k8)*12 - 5.\nSo one might say for n=12, an alternative f value is k8.\n\nMaybe the intended answer: \nf(2) = ? (maybe we assume base keys)\nf(3)= ?\nf(5)= ?\nf(7)= 10\nf(8)= 28\nf(9)= 51\nf(11)=105\nf(12)=223 or alternatively can be written as k8 with a correction.\n\nI wonder if there is more context. Possibly the keys are defined recursively: \nk_n = n * f(n) + g(n), where sometimes f(n) equals one of the previous key's values.\nFor instance, for n=5: maybe f(5)=? But they gave k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3, so that would mean  k5 = ? Possibly then f(5) might be computed as something like (k2*k3)/5 if divisible. But we don't know k2 and k3.\n\nMaybe the puzzle is incomplete. However, the question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" probably expects:\nf(7)=10,\nf(8)=28,\nf(9)=51,\nf(11)=105,\nand for n=12, using the alternative representation we get f(12)=k8 = 224.\n\nBut then what about k2, k3, and k5? They are not given numeric values except that k5 = k2 * k3.\nMaybe they are base cases: perhaps k1= ? k2= ? etc. \n\nI might assume the simplest possibility: maybe the keys follow a pattern where f(n) equals the nth triangular number or something? But 28 is triangular (28 = T7), 105 is triangular too (105 = T14?) Actually, 105 is triangular number 14*15/2=105, and 223 is not triangular though.\n\nWait, check: 224 (k8) is one more than 223. 1155 for k11 is a well-known binomial coefficient? C(11, something)? \nAlso, 76 (k7) appears in the formula for a heptagon maybe.\nAlternatively, these numbers might be factorials or products.\n\nLet's try factoring:\n76 = 2^2 * 19\n224 = 2^5 * 7\n467 is prime? Let me check: 467 mod small primes: not divisible by 3 (4+6+7=17), 467/7 ~66.7, not integer; 467 mod 11 gives 467-11*42=467-462=5, so no.\n1155 factors as 3 * 5 * 7 * 11? Let's check: 3*5=15, 15*7=105, 105*11=1155.\n2683 factors maybe? Check divisibility by small primes: not even; sum digits =19 so not divisible by 3; 2683/7 ~383.2857...; /11 gives 243.909, maybe 17: 17*158 = 2686 close but not equal; 13: 13*206.3846 no.\nMaybe these numbers come from a recurrence like k_n = previous + something.\n\nGiven the data:\nk7=76,\nk8=224,\nk9=467,\nk11=1155,\nk12=2683,\nand also k5 = k2*k3, and k12 can be expressed as k8*12 - 5.\nMaybe we can solve for k2 and k3 if we assume some pattern? Possibly the keys are defined by:\nk_n = n*(f(n)) + g(n)\nwhere f(n) is either an integer or sometimes equals another key's value.\n\nFor n=11, since 1155/11=105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\nFor n=8, f(8)=224/8=28.\nFor n=7, f(7)=76//7 =10 remainder 6, so f(7)=10.\nFor n=9, f(9)=467//9 =51 remainder 8, so f(9)=51.\nFor n=12, if we try to express as quotient and remainder: 2683/12 =223 R7, so one option is f(12)=223. But the alternative representation given is k12 = k8*12 -5, which would suggest that if we let f(n) sometimes be taken from a previous key then for n=12, you could take f(12)=k8=224 and g(12)=-5.\nMaybe the puzzle expects: \nFor key 7: f(7) =10;\nfor key 8: f(8)=28;\nfor key 9: f(9)=51;\nfor key 11: f(11)=105;\nand for key 12, note that 2683 can be written as 224*12 -5, so f(12) might be taken to be k8 =224 instead of the usual quotient.\nSimilarly, for key 5, since it is defined as k2*k3, maybe f(5)=? But we don't have numerical values.\n\nI suspect the intended answer: \nf(2) is not computed because key 2 is a base case.\nFor keys with composite formulas:\nk7 = 7*10 + 6 so f(7)=10;\nk8 = 8*28 so f(8)=28;\nk9 = 9*51 + 8 so f(9)=51;\nk11 = 11*105 so f(11)=105;\nk12 can be expressed as 12*f(12) where normally f(12)=223, but if we use the given representation k12 = k8*12 -5 then f(12) would be interpreted as k8 which is 224.\nSo answer: f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and for key 12 either f(12)=223 or, using the alternative representation, f(12)=k8=224.\n\nHowever, it's ambiguous. The puzzle states \"calculate f(n) for each key\". Possibly they want: \nFor n=5: k5 = k2 * k3 implies that if we assume k2 and k3 are known, then f(5) might be (k2*k3)/5 if divisible.\nMaybe the keys are defined by: k_n = n*(f(n)) + g(n), where sometimes f(n)= constant or equals another key's value.\n\nThe expression \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN\" suggests that the index of a key is involved in its product. For example, key 12: 12 multiplied by something gives almost the key but then adjusted by -5.\nMaybe the pattern is:\nk2 = ?\nk3 = ?\nk5 = k2 * k3,\nk7 = 7*10 + 6,\nk8 = 8*28,\nk9 = 9*51 + 8,\nk11 = 11*105,\nk12 = 12*(? ) -5 which equals 2683.\nMaybe the pattern is that when n is prime, f(n) is something like (n+1 choose something)? For instance, 7: f(7)=10, 11: f(11)=105. \n105 and 10 are triangular numbers: 10 is T4? Actually, 10 is T4 or T5? Triangular numbers: 3,6,10,15,... so 10 = T4? Not exactly.\n28 is T7.\n51 is not a common triangular number though; triangular numbers go: 1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55... so 51 is between 45 and 55.\n223 is not triangular either.\n\nMaybe they are centered hexagonal numbers? 28 is centered hexagonal, but 10 is not.\n\nGiven the insufficient context, I'll provide the decomposition of each key into n*f(n) + remainder:\nFor k7 = 76, we have 76 = 7*10 + 6 so f(7)=10.\nFor k8 = 224, 224 = 8*28 so f(8)=28.\nFor k9 = 467, 467 = 9*51 + 8 so f(9)=51.\nFor k11 = 1155, 1155 = 11*105 so f(11)=105.\nFor k12 = 2683, if written in the form 12*f(12) + g(12), then f(12)=223 and remainder is 7. But alternatively, given k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5 = 224\u00d712 -5, one might say that an alternative choice for f(12) is 224.\nAlso, k5 is defined as k2 \u00d7 k3. Without numerical values for k2 and k3, we can't compute f(5) unless k2 and k3 are given.\n\nMaybe I'll assume base keys: let k1 = something. Often puzzles of this type set k1=1, k2=4, etc. But here they mention index product pattern. Possibly the intended sequence is like the telephone keypad multiplication puzzle \"7-8-9\" but not sure.\n\nI might state:\nAssuming that each key's value can be expressed as n * f(n) + g(n), we find:\nk5 = k2*k3, so if we assume f(5)= (k2*k3)/5 (if divisible),\nk7: 76 = 7*10 + 6 so f(7)=10,\nk8: 224 = 8*28 so f(8)=28,\nk9: 467 = 9*51 + 8 so f(9)=51,\nk11: 1155 = 11*105 so f(11)=105,\nand k12 can be expressed as 12*f(12) with f(12)=223, or alternatively as k8*12 - 5, which gives an alternate factor of k8=224.\n\nThus the answers are:\nf(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and for key 12, either f(12)=223 (if using quotient) or equivalently f(12)=k8=224 (if using the product form k8\u00d712 -5).\n\nI lean towards: \nFor keys given:\nKey 7: f = 10,\nKey 8: f = 28,\nKey 9: f = 51,\nKey 11: f = 105,\nKey 12: f can be taken as either 223 (from division) or, using the alternative representation, equivalently k8 which is 224.\n\nI need to decide one answer. The text \"k12 = k8\u00d712 -5\" explicitly shows a product form similar to other keys except for an offset of -5. That suggests that they intended f(12) to be interpreted as k8 rather than the quotient from division by 12. So perhaps the rule is: sometimes the factor f(n) is taken directly as another key's value when available.\n\nSo final answer:\nFor key 7: f(7)=10,\nfor key 8: f(8)=28,\nfor key 9: f(9)=51,\nfor key 11: f(11)=105, and\nfor key 12: since k12 = k8\u00d712 -5, we can view the factor as k8 which equals 224.\nAnd for key 5, since it's defined by product of keys 2 and 3, its factor would be (k2*k3)/5 if divisible.\n\nWithout knowing k2 and k3 values, that's as far as I can go.\n\nI'll answer: \nf(7)=10,\nf(8)=28,\nf(9)=51,\nf(11)=105,\nand f(12) = 224 (interpreting the given representation).\n\nThus final answer.</think>One acceptable answer was to show that for most of the keys the \u201cfactor\u2010part\u201d f(n) may be read off by writing\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = n\u00b7f(n) + (possibly a remainder),\n\nso that, for example,\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2087 = 76 = 7\u00b710 + 6\u2003\u2003\u27f9\u2003f(7) = 10,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2088 = 224 = 8\u00b728 + 0\u2003\u2003\u27f9\u2003f(8) = 28,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2089 = 467 = 9\u00b751 + 8\u2003\u2003\u27f9\u2003f(9) = 51,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 1155 = 11\u00b7105 + 0\u2003\u2003\u27f9\u2003f(11) = 105.\n\nIn addition the puzzle tells us that\n\u2003\u2003k\u2085 = k\u2082 \u00d7 k\u2083\u2003\u2003\u2003 (so if one knows k\u2082 and k\u2083 then f(5) would be (k\u2082\u00b7k\u2083)/5 provided it divides evenly)\nand also that\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = k\u2088\u00d712 \u2013 5.\nNotice that since k\u2088 = 224 we have\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 224\u00d712 \u2013 5.\n\nOne may therefore \u201cread\u201d the factor in two ways.
