The text: \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\", then it says observed: - k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no). Wait I see: They mention a product relation between indices: k5 equals the product of k2 and k3. That might be one property. Then they mention k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!).\n\nThere's check:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean) meaning that if we try to express k7 as f(7)*7 + g(7), then the result would be not integer? Wait, they calculate \"k7\" equals maybe something like \"76\"? The check: \"k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86\", so perhaps k7 is 76.\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 (which means f(8)=28?) They say \"k8/8=28\" so it is integer, and they claim that is a valid pattern? Let me check: if k8=224 then dividing by 8 gives 28 exactly. So f(8)=? Possibly 28.\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9=51.89 (not clean) so probably not.\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11=105 integer, so valid pattern for index 11.\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12=223.58... but also notice that \"k8\u00d712-5\" equals 2683 because if k8 is 224 then 224*12=2688 and subtract 5 gives 2683.\n\nWait, so the pattern: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). And we are asked: Is there a pattern? Calculate f(n) for each key.\n\nI must now guess which keys? Possibly it's from an \"index product\" puzzle where these keys are defined in some sequence. Possibly the keys are like:\nk2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12,...\n\nThe analysis provided: \n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\n\nAnd then check on others.\n\nSo maybe the keys are: k? are defined as numbers given by some recurrence or pattern. The text \"CHECK\" has for each key:\n1. For k7, apparently we got 76 (as numerator) so that equals something times 7 plus something gives non integer quotient.\n2. k8 = 224 and if expressed as f(8)*8 + g(8), then f(8)=28 exactly because 224/8=28.\n3. k9 is 467, which divided by 9 gives not integer.\n4. k11 equals 1155, which divided by 11 equals 105 exactly.\n5. k12 equals 2683 and if expressed as \"f(12)*12 + g(12)\" then it's non integer quotient but using formula k8\u00d712-5=2683 gives an alternative representation.\n\nI guess that the pattern is: sometimes k_n can be written as n * f(n) where f(n) is integer, i.e., when n divides k_n exactly. And for others, there's a remainder g(n), so maybe it is \"n * f(n) + g(n)\" but with f(n) being integer only if n divides k_n.\n\nThe text \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" That means: For keys that are divisible by their index n, what is f(n)?\n\nWe have: \nk8 = 224 and then f(8)=28 because 224=28*8.\nk11 = 1155 so f(11)=105.\n\nWhat about others? k7 we get quotient 76/7 which is not integer. k9 gives 467/9 not integer, and k12 if considered as \"f(n)*n\" then quotient is not an integer because 2683/12=223.58333, but we notice that k8 * 12 -5 = 2683.\n\nSo maybe the pattern: f(2)=? Possibly using some other keys like k2 and k3 are used to form k5? But the text \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" indicates that for index=5, product of k2 and k3 equals it. That might be a clue.\n\nI should re-read the problem: \nINDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n\nIs there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)?\n\nCalculate f(n) for each key.\n\nMaybe the keys are: 2,3,5,7,8,9,11,12. But then note that index \"n\" is not necessarily prime? Possibly they are all distinct. The notation \"k_n\" might be a function on integers.\n\nI have to assume that there is an underlying sequence of numbers k_n (like keys) which satisfy certain relations. And the problem asks: Is there a pattern where each k_n can be written as f(n)*n + g(n)? And then calculate f(n) for each key. \n\nWe have examples:\n- For n=8, 224 = f(8)*8, so f(8)=28.\n- For n=11, 1155 = f(11)*11, so f(11)=105.\n\nMaybe there is a pattern: Possibly f(n) equals the product of two other keys? Or maybe something like: k_n \u2261 g(n) mod n? \nWait, what is given: \"k8 \u00d712 -5\" for k12. That suggests that maybe for composite numbers, we have an extra subtraction. \n\nI must try to see patterns from observed relations:\nWe have k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3.\nWe have k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5.\n\nSo what are the indices?\nIndices: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 (and maybe others)\n\nMaybe the keys come from a sequence that is defined as:\nk1 = ?,\nk2 = ?,\nk3 = ?,\n...\nIt might be something like a recurrence relation involving multiplication and addition of index.\n\nThe hypothesis: sometimes the INDEX appears in the formula. That means sometimes we have k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), where maybe f(n) is derived from previous keys somehow.\nMaybe pattern: \nFor prime indices, like 2,3,5,7,11 maybe the formula is different than for composite ones?\nObserving: k8 (which is composite, 8= 2^3) is represented as 28\u00d78. And note that 28 is known from sequence? Wait a minute: 28 is one of the perfect numbers. Also, 1155 is interesting because 1+15+55? Not sure.\n\nk5 = k2 * k3. If we assume some known keys, what might they be? Possibly the keys are defined by an \"index product\" puzzle like from Project Euler problem about the keys in a safe or something? Alternatively, it might be a pattern where keys are given as:\nk1=?\nMaybe I'm overthinking.\n\nThe provided text: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" They gave specific numbers:\n\nFor k7: 76/7 = 10.86 (not integer)\nFor k8: 224/8 = 28.\nFor k9: 467/9 \u224851.89\nFor k11: 1155/11=105\nFor k12: 2683/12 \u2248223.58, but note that can be reinterpreted as (k8\u00d712-5)\n\nSo which keys have f(n) integer? k8 and k11 appear to give integer values when divided by n.\n\nMaybe the pattern is \"if n divides k_n evenly then define f(n)=k_n/n, else maybe f(n) is not defined.\" The question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" might be: For which keys does the division yield an integer? Possibly answer:\n\nFor k7, if we try to represent it as 7f + g, f would not be an integer. But perhaps they want us to express them in form of f(n)=k_n/n? Let me re-read:\n\n\"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)?\"\n\nThen \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So likely we are supposed to list keys (n=2,3,...?) with their corresponding f(n). \n\nWe have: \n- For k5? But they haven't given number for k5. But they said k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3.\nMaybe the keys are known from a previous part of the puzzle.\n\nThe available computed values:\nk7: 76\nk8: 224 => f(8)=28 because 224/8=28 exactly.\nk9: 467, but not integer division? 467/9 = 51.888... So f(9) would be 51.888... if we insist on the form f(n)*n + remainder.\nBut maybe pattern means that sometimes you can represent k_n in such a form with f(n) and g(n) being integers (like k8 and k11) but not always.\n\nLet's check: k11 = 1155, then dividing by 11 gives exactly 105. So f(11)=105.\nFor k12 we got quotient 223.5833 if we do division, but note that it is also equal to (k8 \u00d7 12 - 5)/? Actually, they gave the formula: k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5 and we know k8=224 so that equals 2688-5=2683.\n\nMaybe then f(12) might be something like \"if we consider k12 as 12f + g, then f(12)=?\". But if we try to solve: 12f+g = 2683. We want to see if maybe the pattern f(n)=? There is pattern in numbers: 28 and 105 are reminiscent of triangular numbers? 28 is T7 (the 7th triangular number) and 105 is T14 or something? Actually, 28 is a perfect number known as tetrahedral number? Wait, 28 is the sum of the first 7 integers? Actually, 1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28. And 105 is the sum of the first 14 numbers divided by something? Let me check: 1+2+...+14 = 105 (Yes! Because formula: n(n+1)/2 with n=14 gives 105). So maybe f(8)=28, which equals T7, and f(11)=105 equals T14. And notice that the index in the first is 8, but then T7, so 8-1 =7, while for second: 11 and T14, where 14=2*11 - 8? Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k_n are some function of triangular numbers or polygonal numbers. Let's check: k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. If we assume that k2 is something like T1=1 maybe? k3 might be T2=3 maybe? That gives k5=3 which does not match 28, because then k8 would be... Hmm.\n\nMaybe the keys are defined by \"index product\" pattern: k_n = ? Maybe they are given in some known puzzle called \"Keys and the Index Product Puzzle\" where each key is a number that when you multiply it with its index sometimes equals something.\n\nI recall a classic puzzle: \"Find the missing digit in the multiplication problem 3??\" but not sure.\n\nLet me re-read the provided details carefully:\n\nINDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711.\n\nI notice that the numbers: 76, 224, 467, 1155, 2683 correspond to keys for indices 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 respectively. And among these, only k8 and k11 are divisible by their index with an integer quotient.\n\nNow perhaps f(n) is defined as k_n divided by n if that division yields an integer; otherwise maybe it's the floor of k_n/n? But then for k7, floor(76/7)=10, for k9 floor(467/9)=51. And for k12, floor(2683/12)=223.\n\nSo possible pattern: f(n) = floor(k_n / n). Let\u2019s check:\nFor n=7, floor(76/7)=10.86 so 10; for n=8, floor(224/8)=28 exactly; for n=9, floor(467/9)=51; for n=11, floor(1155/11)=105 exactly; for n=12, floor(2683/12)=223.\n\nBut then why mention k8\u00d712-5 for k12? Because 224*12 = 2688 and minus 5 gives 2683. So maybe the pattern is: when index is a multiple of 4 (like 12)? Wait no.\n\nI suspect that there might be an underlying formula: k_n = n * f(n) + g(n), where sometimes g(n)=0, sometimes not. The observations indicate that for n=8 and n=11, g(n) becomes 0 because the division is exact, so f(8)=28, f(11)=105.\n\nSo maybe answer: f(7)=? But wait, if we express k_7 as 7f + g, then f might be defined to be the integer quotient when dividing by n. So:\nFor n=7: 76 = 7*10 + 6, so f(7)=10.\nFor n=8: 224 = 8*28 + 0, so f(8)=28.\nFor n=9: 467 = 9*51 + 8, so f(9)=51.\nFor n=11: 1155 = 11*105 + 0, so f(11)=105.\nFor n=12: 2683 = 12*223 + 7, so f(12)=223.\n\nBut then what about k2, k3, and k5? They are referenced in the observed relation: k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. We might need to determine them as well. Possibly earlier keys: Let's denote:\nk2, k3, k4, etc.\nWe know k5 = k2 * k3, but we don't have values.\n\nMaybe we assume they follow the same pattern with f(n)=? Maybe we can guess k2, k3 from other information? We see that for composite ones like 12, the formula sometimes involves a previous key (k8) multiplied by the index minus some constant. For example, k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5.\nMaybe there is a recurrence: if n is divisible by 4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer expects: f(2)=?, f(3)=?, etc. But we don't have numbers for those keys.\n\nThe question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" likely means for the given ones (n=7,8,9,11,12), what are their f values when expressing k_n in the form n f + g? And as computed:\n- For key 7: f(7)=10.\n- For key 8: f(8)=28.\n- For key 9: f(9)=51.\n- For key 11: f(11)=105.\n- For key 12: f(12)=223.\n\nLet\u2019s check the arithmetic:\nk7 = 76, divided by 7 gives quotient 10 remainder 6, so f(7)=10.\nk8 = 224, divided by 8 gives quotient 28 remainder 0, so f(8)=28.\nk9 = 467, divided by 9 gives quotient 51 remainder 8 (since 9*51=459, remainder 8), so f(9)=51.\nk11 = 1155, divided by 11 gives quotient 105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\nk12 = 2683, divided by 12 gives quotient 223 with remainder? Let's check: 12*223 = 2676, remainder 7, so f(12)=223.\n\nThe pattern in the remainders (g(n)) might be g(7)=6, g(8)=0, g(9)=8, g(11)=0, g(12)=7. Not an obvious sequence.\n\nMaybe there is a hidden pattern: The numbers 10,28,51,105,223... do they have a recurrence? Differences:\n28-10=18; 51-28=23; 105-51=54; 223-105=118.\nNot clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(n) equals something like the product of previous ones: f(8)=k2/k? No.\n\nWait, k5 = k2*k3. That relation might help if we knew what are k2 and k3. Possibly they follow a similar formula: \nMaybe k2 and k3 also can be represented as 2f(2)+g(2) etc.\nBut without additional info, I think the best answer is: \"Yes, we see that sometimes the index divides the key exactly (for n=8 and 11), yielding f(8)=28 and f(11)=105. In other cases, the division gives a non-integer quotient, so if we take the floor, then f(7)=10, f(9)=51, and f(12)=223.\"\n\nBut perhaps the intended answer: \nk7 = 7 * 10 + 6,\nk8 = 8 * 28 + 0,\nk9 = 9 * 51 + 8,\nk11 = 11 * 105 + 0,\nk12 = 12 * 223 + 7.\n\nSo the answer: f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and f(12)=223.\n\nI can mention that for n=5 we have k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3, which might be expressed in this form if additional information is available.\n\nThus answer: \nf(7) = 10,\nf(8) = 28,\nf(9) = 51,\nf(11) = 105,\nf(12) = 223.\nAnd note that for n=8 and 11 the remainder g(n) is zero, suggesting a special role.\n\nI might also note: The numbers f(n)=10,28,51,105,223 seem to have a pattern relative to triangular numbers? 28 is T7, 105 is T14. And 10 could be seen as T4+T3 maybe; 51 as something; 223 is not triangular though (the 20th triangular number is 210 and the 21st is 231, so 223 is in between). Possibly they are one less or more than a triangular number.\n\nAlternatively, check: 10+? Not sure.\n\nGiven the limited context, I'll provide the computed values. I'll also note that f(n) appears to be the quotient when dividing k_n by n, and we see for keys 8 and 11 this division is exact (g=0), while for others it's not.\n\nI can answer: \"Yes, one finds that k7 = 7\u00d710 + 6, k8 = 8\u00d728 + 0, k9 = 9\u00d751 + 8, k11 = 11\u00d7105 + 0, and k12 = 12\u00d7223 + 7. Thus f(7) = 10, f(8) = 28, f(9) = 51, f(11) = 105, and f(12) = 223.\" That would be my answer.\n\nI'll now produce final answer accordingly.</think>We will show that in several cases the key k\u2099 can be written in the form\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = n\u00b7f(n) + g(n).\n\nFor example, if you look at two of our \u201ckeys\u201d you will see that sometimes the division is exact (so that g(n)=0) and sometimes not.\n\nIn our work we have found numerically that\n\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2087 = 76. Writing this as 7\u00b7f(7)+g(7) we have\n\u2003\u20037\u00b710 + 6 = 70+6 = 76,\nso one may take f(7)=10 (with remainder g(7)=6).\n\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2088 = 224. Since 224\u00f78 = 28 exactly, we may write\n\u2003\u2003k\u2088 = 8\u00b728 + 0,\nso here f(8)=28.\n\nSimilarly one finds that\n\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2089 = 467 = 9\u00b751 + 8\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003f(9)=51 (with remainder g(9)=8),\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 1155 = 11\u00b7105 + 0\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003f(11)=105,\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 2683. Now 2683\u00f712 is not an integer (since 12\u00d7223=2676, leaving a remainder of 7) so\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 12\u00b7223 + 7\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003f(12)=223.\n\nThere is also an observed relation for another key: k\u2085 was found to equal the product k\u2082\u00d7k\u2083. (One may show that if one expresses these keys in the form n\u00b7f(n)+g(n) then sometimes the index itself \u201cappears\u201d in the formula; as we see above, for n = 8 and n = 11 the remainder g(n) happens to vanish.)\n\nThus, if one wishes to \u201cextract\u201d a function f from each key by writing k\u2099 = n\u00b7f(n)+g(n), then at least in our examples one obtains\n\n\u2003\u2003f(7)=10,\n\u2003\u2003f(8)=28,\n\u2003\u2003f(9)=51,\n\u2003\u2003f(11)=105, and\n\u2003\u2003f(12)=223.\n\nThese are the values of f(n) for the given keys. (In other cases where k\u2099 is not exactly divisible by n one may take f(n) to be the quotient when dividing k\u2099 by n.)",
