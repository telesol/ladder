  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check if the given sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence relation of the form \\( k_n = a \\times k_{n-1} + b \\times k_{n-2} \\). The problem provides specific values for \\( k_7 = 76 \\) and \\( k_8 = 224 \\), and asks if there exist integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) that satisfy these equations. Additionally, the user mentioned trying a recurrence with an added constant \\( c \\), so maybe I should consider that possibility too. \n\nFirst, let's focus on the linear recurrence without the constant term. The two equations given are:\n\n1. \\( 76 = 49a + 21b \\)\n2. \\( 224 = 76a + 49b \\)\n\nI need to solve this system of equations for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Since they are asking for integer solutions, maybe I can use substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination. Let me write the equations again:\n\nEquation 1: \\( 49a + 21b = 76 \\)\n\nEquation 2: \\( 76a + 49b = 224 \\)\n\nHmm. Let's see if I can eliminate one variable. Let's try to eliminate \\( a \\) first. To do that, I can multiply the first equation by 76 and the second equation by 49 so that the coefficients of \\( a \\) will be the same. Wait, but that might lead to big numbers. Maybe a better way is to use the elimination method more cleverly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express one variable in terms of the other from the first equation and substitute into the second. Let's try that.\n\nFrom Equation 1:\n\n\\( 49a = 76 - 21b \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( a = \\frac{76 - 21b}{49} \\)\n\nHmm, but since \\( a \\) needs to be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by 49. Let's see if that's possible. Let me plug this into Equation 2.\n\nSubstitute \\( a = \\frac{76 - 21b}{49} \\) into Equation 2:\n\n\\( 76 \\times \\left( \\frac{76 - 21b}{49} \\right) + 49b = 224 \\)\n\nLet me compute each term step by step. First, multiply 76 by that fraction:\n\n\\( \\frac{76 \\times 76}{49} - \\frac{76 \\times 21b}{49} + 49b = 224 \\)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: \\( \\frac{76^2}{49} \\). Let me compute 76 squared. 76*76 is 5776. So first term is 5776/49.\n\nSecond term: \\( \\frac{76*21b}{49} \\). 76*21 is 1596. So that term is (1596b)/49.\n\nThird term: 49b.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n\\( \\frac{5776}{49} - \\frac{1596b}{49} + 49b = 224 \\)\n\nLet me combine the terms with \\( b \\):\n\nThe second term is \\( -1596b/49 \\), and the third term is \\( 49b \\). Let me write the third term as \\( (49b * 49)/49 \\) so they have the same denominator:\n\nWait, actually, to combine them, I can write:\n\n\\( - \\frac{1596b}{49} + \\frac{49b \\times 49}{49} \\)\n\nWait, no, that's overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 49b is equal to (49b * 49)/49? Wait, no. Actually, to combine terms over the same denominator, the 49b needs to be expressed over 49. So:\n\n\\( 49b = \\frac{49b \\times 49}{49} \\)? Wait, no, that would be incorrect. Actually, 49b is equal to \\( \\frac{49b \\times 49}{49} \\), but that's not helpful. Wait, perhaps I should just compute the coefficients properly.\n\nLet me write all terms over 49:\n\n\\( \\frac{5776}{49} + \\left( - \\frac{1596b}{49} + \\frac{49b \\times 49}{49} \\right) \\). Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nActually, the third term is 49b. To combine with the second term, which is over 49, we can write:\n\n49b = (49b * 49)/49? Hmm, no. Alternatively, let me get all terms over 49 denominator:\n\nThe equation is:\n\n\\( \\frac{5776 - 1596b}{49} + 49b = 224 \\)\n\nWait, no, actually, the third term is not over 49. Hmm. Maybe it's better to multiply everything by 49 to eliminate denominators.\n\nLet me start over. Let me take the substituted equation:\n\n\\( 76 \\times \\left( \\frac{76 - 21b}{49} \\right) + 49b = 224 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n\\( 76*(76 - 21b) + 49b*49 = 224*49 \\)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 76*(76 - 21b) = 76^2 - 76*21b\n\nSecond term: 49b*49 = 49\u00b2b\n\nThird term: 224*49\n\nCompute each part:\n\nFirst: 76^2 is 5776, 76*21 = 1596, so first term is 5776 - 1596b\n\nSecond term: 49\u00b2 is 2401, so that term is 2401b\n\nThird term: 224*49. Let's compute that. 224 divided by 49 is 4.57... but exact value: 49*45 is 2205, so 224*49 = 2205 + (4*49) = 2205 + 196 = 2401. Wait really?\n\nWait 49*45 is 2205, then 49*46 is 2205 +49=2254, 49*47=2254+49=2303, 49*48=2303+49=2352, 49*49=2401. But 224 is less than 49*5 (245). Wait, 49*4=196, so 49*4.56? Hmm, perhaps better to compute 224*50 =11200 minus 224*1=224, so 11200-224=10976. Wait, no, wait 224*49 is 224*(50-1)=224*50 -224=11200 -224=10976. Wait that can't be. Wait, 224 x 49:\n\nLet me compute 224 * 40 = 8960, 224*9=2016, so total is 8960+2016=10976. Yes, so 10976.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nLeft side is (5776 -1596b) +2401b = 5776 + (2401b -1596b) = 5776 + 805b\n\nRight side is 10976\n\nThus:\n\n5776 + 805b = 10976\n\nSubtract 5776 from both sides:\n\n805b = 10976 -5776 = 5200\n\nSo, b = 5200 /805\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 5200/5=1040, 805/5=161, so 1040/161\n\nHmm, 161 x 6 = 966, 1040 -966=74, so 6 with remainder 74. So 1040/161 is approximately 6.4658. Not an integer. Hmm, so that suggests that b is not an integer. Which is a problem because the question asks for integer a and b.\n\nHmm. So maybe there is no integer solution? Wait but the problem says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So perhaps there isn't?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me check my steps again.\n\nStarting from substitution:\n\nEquation 1: \\( 49a +21b =76 \\)\n\nEquation 2: \\(76a +49b=224 \\)\n\nExpress a from equation 1: \\( a = (76 -21b)/49 \\). Then substituting into equation 2 gives:\n\n76*(76 -21b)/49 +49b =224\n\nMultiply all terms by 49:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49b*49 =224*49\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n76*76 =5776, 76*21b=1596b, so first term is 5776 -1596b\n\nSecond term is 49*49*b=2401b\n\nThird term 224*49=10976. So equation becomes:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b =10976\n\nSo that's 5776 + (2401-1596)b =10976\n\n2401 -1596 = 805. So 5776 +805b=10976\n\nSo 805b =10976 -5776. Let me compute 10976 -5776:\n\n10976 minus 5000 is 5976, then minus 776 more is 5976-776=5200. So yes, 805b=5200.\n\nSo b=5200/805. Let me see if this reduces.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 5200/5=1040, 805/5=161.\n\nSo 1040/161. Let me see if 161 divides 1040. 161*6=966, 1040-966=74. 161*0.46\u224874. So no, not divisible. Hence b is not integer.\n\nHmm, so that suggests no integer solutions. But the problem says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" Maybe there is a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the question? Or perhaps I need to consider that maybe the prior terms are different?\n\nWait, hold on. The problem mentions k7=76 and k8=224, but to set up the equations, they use k6 and k5? Wait the user wrote:\n\n\"For k7 = 76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\" \n\nWait, so they assumed that k6=49 and k5=21? Because in the recurrence, k7 = a*k6 + b*k5. So the user must have prior terms. Wait, but the user didn't provide the entire sequence, but maybe in their context, they have previous terms? Wait the problem says \"FIBONACCI-LIKE RECURRENCE CHECK\" and the user is asking whether for k7 and k8, given that they are 76 and 224, with presumably k6=49 and k5=21? Because otherwise the equations wouldn't make sense.\n\nWait, let me check again. The user says:\n\n\"For k7 = 76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\"\n\nSo they are saying that k7 is equal to a multiplied by k6 (which is 49) plus b multiplied by k5 (which is 21). So the prior terms k6=49, k5=21, so that's given. So similarly, k8 is 224 = a\u00d7k7 + b\u00d7k6, so a\u00d776 + b\u00d749. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the system is indeed equations 1 and 2 as written. So solving that gives non-integer solutions, so there are no integer a and b. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows a and b to be fractions? The user says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So they are specifically asking for integer coefficients. Since that seems impossible, maybe the answer is no? But let me see if there is an error in my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try solving the equations with fractions and see.\n\nFrom equation 1: 49a +21b =76\n\nLet me try to write this as 7a +3b = 76/7 \u224810.857, but that's messy. Alternatively, perhaps using the two equations:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me try elimination. Let's multiply equation1 by 76 and equation2 by 49 so that the coefficients of a will be 49*76 and 76*49, same, so subtract:\n\nMultiply equation1 by 76:\n\n49*76 a +21*76 b =76^2\n\nMultiply equation2 by49:\n\n76*49 a +49*49 b =224*49\n\nSubtract equation1*76 from equation2*49:\n\n(76*49a -49*76a) + (49\u00b2b -21*76b) =224*49 -76\u00b2\n\nThe first terms cancel out. The second terms:\n\nb*(49\u00b2 -21*76) =224*49 -76\u00b2\n\nCompute 49\u00b2 =2401, 21*76=1596, so 2401 -1596=805\n\nRight side: 224*49=10976, and 76\u00b2=5776, so 10976 -5776=5200\n\nThus, 805b =5200\n\nSo again, b=5200/805, same as before. So that confirms the prior result. So unless this reduces, which it doesn't, there's no integer solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in their setup? Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe user states:\n\n\"For k7 = 76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n\nFor k8 = 224: 224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\"\n\nAssuming k6=49 and k5=21, then yes, that's correct. So the problem is set up correctly.\n\nHmm, so with that, seems like there are no integer solutions for a and b, so the answer would be no.\n\nBut maybe let's try to see if there are real numbers a and b, just to check.\n\nWe can write the equations as a linear system:\n\n49a +21b =76\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nWe can write this in matrix form:\n\n[49  21][a]   = [76]\n\n[76 49][b]     [224]\n\nTo solve this, compute determinant:\n\nDeterminant D = (49)(49) - (21)(76) = 49\u00b2 - 21*76\n\nCompute 49\u00b2=2401, 21*76=1596, so D=2401 -1596=805\n\nThen,\n\na = (76*49 -21*224)/D\n\nCompute numerator: 76*49 =3724, 21*224=4704\n\nSo numerator:3724 -4704 = -980\n\nThus a= -980 /805 = simplifying: divide numerator and denominator by 5: -196/161 \u2248-1.217\n\nSimilarly, b=(49*224 -76*76)/D\n\nCompute numerator:49*224=10976, 76*76=5776\n\nThus numerator:10976 -5776=5200\n\nThus b=5200/805= same as before, which is approx 6.465\n\nSo the solutions are a\u2248-1.217 and b\u22486.465. Since these are not integers, the answer to the question is no.\n\nBut perhaps the problem allows fractions? Let me see the question again:\n\n\"Can you find integer a, b?\"\n\nSo yes, the question is asking specifically for integers. Thus the answer is no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a miscalculation here. Let me check once again.\n\nWait, the calculation for a is (76*49 -21*224)/805\n\nWait 76\u00d749: 70\u00d749=3430, 6\u00d749=294, so 3430+294=3724\n\n21\u00d7224: 20\u00d7224=4480, 1\u00d7224=224, total 4704\n\nThus numerator is 3724-4704= -980, yes.\n\nSo a= -980/805. Let me see if that can be reduced:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: -196/161. 196 and 161: 161 is 23\u00d77, 196 is 28\u00d77. So 196=28\u00d77, 161=23\u00d77. So divide numerator and denominator by 7: -28/23. So a= -28/23 \u2248-1.217\n\nSimilarly, b=5200/805. Let me see if that can be reduced:\n\n5200/805 divide numerator and denominator by 5: 1040/161. 161 is 23\u00d77, 1040 divided by 23? 23\u00d745=1035, so 1040-1035=5, so no. So 1040/161 is simplest form. So yes, fractions but not integers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, there are no integer solutions for a and b. Hence the Fibonacci-like recurrence with integer coefficients cannot produce k7=76 and k8=224 given k6=49 and k5=21.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows a and b to be real numbers? But the question specifically asks for integers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the prior terms are different? The problem states k7=76 and k8=224, but maybe the user assumed k6 and k5 as given. If that's the case, but if the prior terms are different, then equations would change. But the user presented the equations as such, so I have to go with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, but assuming the given equations, the answer is no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the problem again.\n\nWait, the user's exact question is: \"FIBONACCI-LIKE RECURRENCE CHECK. ... Can you find integer a, b?\"\n\nSo given the equations as per the user's setup (using k6=49 and k5=21 for k7, and k7=76 and k6=49 for k8), the equations lead to non-integer a and b. Hence the answer is no.\n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe the user intended the prior terms to be different? Let's see, perhaps the terms before 49 and 21?\n\nWait, if the recurrence is order 2, then to compute k7 you need k6 and k5, so the user must have those terms as 49 and 21. If the user had different terms, they would have mentioned. Hence I think the equations are correctly set up.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that there are no integer coefficients a and b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting to consider a and b as real numbers and the question is a trick question? But it says integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation in the determinant?\n\nWait determinant D= (49)(49)-(21)(76)=2401 - (21\u00d776). Let me recompute 21\u00d776. 20\u00d776=1520, 1\u00d776=76, total 1596. 2401-1596=805, correct.\n\nThus the calculation is correct.\n\nHmm, so unless I'm missing something, it seems there are no integer solutions. Therefore, the answer is no, such integers a and b do not exist.\n\nBut the problem might also be asking for a different kind of recurrence? Or perhaps the problem is in the setup. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the answer in fractions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that despite non-integer coefficients, there might be another way? But given the question's phrasing, it's about integers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where you have to realize that it's impossible, hence the answer is no.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there are small integers a and b that approximately satisfy the equations.\n\nSuppose we try a= -1 and b=6:\n\nThen 49*(-1) +21*6= -49 +126=77, which is close to 76, but not exact.\n\na= -2, b=7:\n\n49*(-2)+21*7= -98 +147=49, which is too low.\n\na=0, b=76/21\u22483.619, but not integer.\n\na= -1, b=6 gives 77. Hmm.\n\na= -1, b=5.952 gives 76, but that's fractional.\n\nAlternatively, trying with a= -1 and b=6 gives 77 for first equation, which is off by 1. Maybe the user made a typo in k7's value? If k7 were 77 instead of 76, then a=-1 and b=6 would work, since 49*(-1)+21*6= -49+126=77, and then second equation:76*(-1)+49*6= -76+294=218, which is not 224. Hmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, if k8 is 218 instead of 224, but that's speculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different pair. Let me try a= -2 and b=8:\n\nFirst equation:49*(-2)+21*8= -98 +168=70, which is less than76.\n\na= -1, b=7: 49*(-1)+21*7= -49 +147=98\u226076.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a= -28/23 and b=1040/161, but those are the exact fractions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows for a and b to be fractions, but the problem states \"integer\".\n\nHence, I think the answer is that there are no integer solutions for a and b. Therefore, the Fibonacci-like recurrence with integer coefficients cannot produce the given terms.\n\nBut let me check the problem once again to make sure I didn't misinterpret.\n\nThe user's problem is titled \"FIBONACCI-LIKE RECURRENCE CHECK\", and they present equations for k7 and k8 in terms of previous terms (assumed to be 49 and 21 for k6 and k5, 76 and 49 for k7 and k6 in the second equation). The question is whether integers a and b exist.\n\nGiven that the solution requires a\u2248-1.217 and b\u22486.465, which are not integers, the answer is no. Therefore, the boxed answer would be \\boxed{No} but since in math problems often answers are numerical, but since they asked for existence, maybe stating no solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check if there is a different approach. For example, maybe the recurrence is of higher order? But the problem says \"Fibonacci-like\" which is typically order 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the coefficients are allowed to be different for different terms? But the problem says \"Fibonacci-like recurrence\", which usually has fixed coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made an error in transcribing the problem. If, for example, k8 was 225 instead of 224, then b would be 5205/805= simplifying? Let me see:\n\nWait, if k8 was 225, then the second equation would be 76a +49b=225. Then with a= -28/23, then 76*(-28/23)+49b=225. Let's see, but this is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem might be expecting an answer in terms of the coefficients, but since they aren't integers, perhaps the problem is a trick question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the determinant?\n\nWait, let me recompute a and b:\n\nThe system is:\n\n49a +21b =76\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me solve using elimination.\n\nMultiply equation1 by 49 and equation2 by21 to eliminate b:\n\nEquation1*49: 49*49 a +21*49 b =76*49\n\nEquation2*21:76*21 a +49*21 b =224*21\n\nSubtract equation2*21 from equation1*49:\n\n[49\u00b2 a -76*21 a] + [21*49 b -49*21 b] =76*49 -224*21\n\nThe b terms cancel out.\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\na*(49\u00b2 -76*21) =76*49 -224*21\n\nCompute 49\u00b2=2401, 76*21=1596, so 2401-1596=805\n\nRHS:76\u00d749=3724; 224\u00d721=4704 \u2192 3724-4704= -980\n\nThus:\n\n805 a = -980 \u2192 a= -980/805= same as before.\n\nSimilarly, solving for b:\n\nMultiply equation1 by76 and equation2 by49:\n\nEquation1\u00d776:49\u00d776 a +21\u00d776 b =76\u00d776\n\nEquation2\u00d749:76\u00d749 a +49\u00d749 b =224\u00d749\n\nSubtract equation1\u00d776 from equation2\u00d749:\n\n[76\u00d749 a -49\u00d776 a] + [49\u00b2 b -21\u00d776 b] =224\u00d749 -76\u00b2\n\nThe a terms cancel.\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\nb*(49\u00b2 -21\u00d776)=224\u00d749 -76\u00b2\n\nCompute 49\u00b2=2401, 21\u00d776=1596 \u2192 2401-1596=805\n\nRHS:224\u00d749=10976; 76\u00b2=5776 \u2192 10976-5776=5200\n\nThus 805 b=5200 \u2192 b=5200/805= same as before.\n\nThus calculations are consistent. Hence, the answer is no integer solutions exist.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that there are no such integers a and b. Since the problem asks to put the final answer in boxed, maybe stating no solution or indicating the coefficients, but since it's a yes/no question, but in math problems often boxed answers are numerical. But since the question is \"Can you find...\", the answer is \"No\", so boxed as \\boxed{No}.\n\nAlternatively, if they expect coefficients in fractions, but the question specifies integers, so boxed \"No\".\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{No}\n",
