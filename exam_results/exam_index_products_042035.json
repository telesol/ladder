Possibly we need to determine some product formulas.\n\nObserving:\n\nGiven data points:\n- k12 is given as \"k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\", so that means k12 = (k8 * 12) - 5. But also k8 equals 28 * 8 from observation: they said \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713\" meaning the quotient is integer and equals 28.\n\nSo we have:\nk2, k3? They mention k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3? But that doesn't match pattern: if there's a formula \"k_n = f(n) * n + g(n)\" then for n=2, maybe k2 = something times 2 plus something. And also it appears from the hypothesis that sometimes index appears in formula. It may be a pattern from some puzzle.\n\nThe text is not completely clear: \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\". The observed lines:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no) Perhaps they mean \"k5 equals the product of k2 and k3\"? But that doesn't match pattern \"f(n)*n + g(n)\" because for n=5 you would have f(5)*5+g(5)? Not sure.\n\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!) So they say, \"k12 equals k8 times 12 minus 5.\" And then they check:\n1. For key 7: k7 seems to be not of the form ?\u00d77+? because dividing by 7 doesn't give an integer: 76/7 = 10.86.\n2. For key 8: k8 equals ? \u00d7 8 + ? with quotient exactly equal to 28 so that works (k8=224, because 28*8=224, so maybe it's f(8)=28 and g(8)=0? Actually the check is \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28\", implying that f(n) is simply k_n/n for some keys.)\n3. For key 9: k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? but 467/9=51.89, not integer.\n4. For key 11: k11 = ? \u00d7 11+? \u2192 1155/11=105 (an integer) so f(11)=105 and g(11)=0 maybe.\n5. For key 12: k12= ?\u00d712+? gives 2683/12=223.58, but using formula k8*12 -5 = 28 * 12 - 5 = 336-5=331, not 2683.\n\nWait there's a discrepancy: They show \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\" which is contradictory: if you compute k8*12 -5 with k8 being 224, then k8*12-5=224*12-5 = 2688-5 = 2683. So that's consistent.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: For some keys n (like 2, 3, 4, etc.), maybe we have f(n)=? and g(n)=? such that k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). The ones that worked with an integer quotient are for n=8 and n=11. They claim k8 = ? \u00d7 8+? equals 224, so f(8) is likely 28 (and remainder maybe 0 if it divides evenly).\nk11: 1155/11=105, so f(11)=105 with remainder 0.\nFor others: k2 maybe? Not sure.\n\nWe are asked \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nMaybe we need to list keys and their corresponding values f(n). The given check lines:\n- k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. But the provided numbers are: k7=76? Wait, they mention \"k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86\", so maybe k7 = 76 (or maybe not)\n\nLet's re-read carefully:\n\nThe user message:\n```\nINDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n```\n\nThus keys: \nk2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12 are mentioned. They give numeric values for some keys:\nk7 seems to be 76 (because 76/7=10.86).\nk8 is given as 224.\nk9 is given as 467.\nk11 is given as 1155.\nk12 is given as 2683.\n\nAnd also k2, k3, k5? Possibly we assume they are given somewhere else, but not provided here. Perhaps we can deduce them from the pattern \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\" and maybe by some product property: The observed first line \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" might be a separate observation.\n\nThe problem asks: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So likely keys are 7,8,9,11,12, etc. But the text says \"for each key\", but only some are provided. I suspect we need to find function f(n) such that k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), and apparently sometimes f(n) is just k_n/n when remainder is zero.\n\nFor keys where it divides evenly, f(n)=k_n / n.\nSo for k8: 224/8=28. For k11:1155/11=105.\n\nWhat about others? k7 gives quotient 76/7=10.857..., so not integer. But maybe we are supposed to consider something like \"f(n) is the nearest integer or perhaps floor division?\" Perhaps f(n)=floor(k_n/n)? But then for k7, floor(76/7)=10. For k9, floor(467/9)=51. For k12, if using that formula: 2683/12=223 remainder something.\n\nBut wait, check k12: They mention \"k8\u00d712-5 = 224*12 -5 =2683\", so it fits the pattern for k12? But then f(12) would be (k8\u00d712-5)/12? That equals (28*12-5)/12= (336-5)/12=331/12 which is not an integer. So maybe g(n) can be non-zero.\n\nWe hypothesize: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), where sometimes f(n) and g(n) are constants that follow a pattern when the index appears in formula.\n\nMaybe the hypothesis is: For some indices, like 8 and 11, we have exact division so that g(n)=0. And for others like 7,9,12, g(n) is not zero.\nWe are asked \"Calculate f(n) for each key\". Perhaps we need to compute these f's:\n\nFor n=2? We don't know k2 value maybe it's given somewhere else?\nWait, the message: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" suggests that the product of keys 2 and 3 equals key 5. But without knowing k2 and k3 explicitly, we can denote them as unknowns.\n\nMaybe the intended analysis is: The pattern is sometimes index appears in multiplication inside formula. They provide examples where the coefficient f(n) = k_n / n when that division yields an integer. For k8, f(8)=28; for k11, f(11)=105. And maybe we need to compute f(n)=? from others: f(7) might be 76/7 approximated as 10.857, but if we assume nearest whole number perhaps f(7)=11? But then remainder would be negative? Let's check: If k7 = 11*7 + something, then that equals 77 plus something must equal 76 so remainder is -1. That doesn't seem to be a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the idea is that sometimes when you express the key as f(n)*n + g(n), f(n) might represent some known sequence (like triangular numbers or factorials)? For instance: 28 is 7 choose something? 105 is the binomial coefficient C(15,?) Actually 105 is a well-known combination number, but also it's 7*15. But not sure.\n\nWait, let me consider possibility: Maybe these keys are part of a pattern from some puzzle like \"k\" numbers are keys for letters maybe? Possibly the sequence k2, k3,... are assigned to letters? The observation \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" reminds me of alphametic puzzles or something.\n\nThe user's note says \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\" So they're noticing that sometimes n is used as a multiplier. For example, k8= ?\u00d78+? and it works out exactly to 28, meaning that k8/8 equals 28. And k11 gives 1155/11=105. And then k12: if you try dividing by 12 you get non integer but using the formula \"k8\u00d712-5\" which is exactly 2683, so it seems the multiplier for n=12 in that formula might be f(12)= (28*12 - 5)/12 = (336 - 5)/12 =331/12, not an integer.\n\nBut then what is g(n)? It might be a function defined such that: For key 8, maybe k8 = 28*8+0 so f(8)=28 and g(8)=0. For key 11, f(11)=105 and g(11)=0.\nFor key 12, if we force the form k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) then f(12)=? Possibly floor division: Let f(12)=223 and remainder g(12)=2683 - 223*12. Compute: 223*12=2676, so remainder would be 7. But they mention \"k8\u00d712-5\" which is not equal to 223*12+? Wait recalc: k12 given is 2683 from the observation (k8\u00d712-5 with k8 =224 gives 2683). Now if we set f(12)=223 then g(12)=2683 -223*12=2683-2676=7. For key 9, f(9)=? floor division: 467/9 =51 remainder 8 because 9*51=459 and remainder is 8.\n\nFor key 7: 76 divided by 7 gives quotient 10 with remainder 6 (since 10*7=70, remainder 6). But the check said \"76/7 = 10.86\", which means a non-integer quotient.\nThus if we assume f(n) is the integer part of k_n/n then:\nk2? Not given value though\nk3? not given.\nk5? not provided.\n\nWe only have keys: 7,8,9,11,12. But then the message \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" might mean list f(7), f(8), f(9), f(11), f(12). That would be:\nf(7)=10 (if we take floor division)\nf(8)=28\nf(9)=51\nf(11)=105\nf(12)=223 if using floor division.\n\nBut wait, check 2683/12 is not exactly 223 because 12*223=2676 remainder 7. So f(n) might be the integer part of the quotient if we consider k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). But then note that for n=8 and n=11, the division is exact so f(8)=28, f(11)=105.\n\nI need to re-read the original text: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" The keys mentioned are: maybe k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. But we only see computed values for 7,8,9,11,12.\n\nMaybe the intended answer is to compute: \nFor k7: f(7)=10 (or 11?) since 76/7=10.857.\nFor k8: f(8)=28 exactly.\nFor k9: f(9)=51 exactly? Because 467/9 =51.888, not integer though.\nWait recalc: 51*9=459, remainder 8, so maybe f(9) should be 52 if rounding? But they said 467/9=51.89 (i.e., 51.888...), so the exact quotient is 51.888, not 52 exactly.\n\nMaybe the pattern is: sometimes k_n = (n-?) * n plus something? \nFor key 7: maybe we want f(7)=76/7 approximates 10.857, but no clear integer.\nWait, let me re-read:\n\"CHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\n\nThey are checking if the key numbers can be expressed as f(n)*n+g(n) with the coefficient f(n) being an integer (or clean value). For some indices, it divides evenly; for others, it does not.\n\nMaybe the intended answer: \"Yes, there appears to be a pattern where k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), and when it works out cleanly we get that f(n)=k_n/n. From our observations:\n- For n=7, f(7) \u2248 10.857 (not integer).\n- For n=8, f(8)=28.\n- For n=9, f(9) \u2248 51.889 (non-integer),\n- For n=11, f(11)=105,\n- For n=12, if we apply the formula k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then from k8\u00d712-5 we get f(12)= (k8\u00d712 - 5)/12 = (28*12 - 5)/12 = (336-5)/12 =331/12 \u224827.583, which is not an integer either.\"\n\nThat doesn't look consistent.\n\nMaybe we should try to solve for g(n) using the known products: k2 * k3 = k5.\nSo maybe if we assume k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then for n=2,3,5 we have relationships. Let's denote:\nk2 = 2f(2)+g(2)\nk3 = 3f(3)+g(3)\nk5 = 5f(5)+g(5)\nAnd k5 = k2 * k3.\nWe don't know f and g though.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are defined by: k_n = n! - something? Because 28 is 4!, but no, 8's key equals 224 which is 7 choose something? 224 might be C(8,?) I recall binomial coefficients: C(8,3)=56; not 28. But 28 appears as a binomial coefficient for 8 choose something sometimes.\n\nWait, 105 is a central binomial coefficient? Actually 105 = C(15,2) maybe?\n\nLet's try to see pattern:\nk7 = 76 (if we assume that from the division 76/7=10.857, then k7 might be exactly 76).\nk8 = 224.\nk9 = 467.\nk11 = 1155.\nk12 = 2683.\n\nThese numbers appear: 76, 224, 467, 1155, 2683. They might come from a recurrence? Differences:\n224 - 76 =148,\n467-224=243,\n1155-467=688,\n2683-1155=1528.\nDifferences are not linear.\n\nMaybe they are related to prime numbers? \n7 is prime, 11 is prime. But then 8 and 9 and 12 are composite.\nOr maybe these keys represent letter values in a cryptogram?\nThe fact that k5 = k2*k3 suggests multiplication of digits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to express the keys as f(n)*n + g(n) where f(n) is some known sequence. For n=8, it's 28 which is binomial coefficient \"C(8, something)\"? Actually C(8,2)=28. And for n=11, 105 equals C(11,3)? Let's check: C(11,3)=165, not 105; but C(11,4)=330, no.\n\nWait, maybe f(n) = binomial coefficient? For n=8, the central binomial coefficient is 70 usually. But 28 appears as a binomial coefficient for n choose something: C(8,2)=28 indeed.\nFor n=11, 105 equals C(11,4)? Let's check: C(11,4) =330; C(11,3)=165; but 105 is C(11,?); maybe C(10,3)=120, no.\n\nMaybe f(n) is the nth Fibonacci number? Fibonacci numbers: 8th Fibonacci is 21, not 28 though.\nAlternatively, f(n) might be triangular numbers. Triangular numbers: T7=28, T6=21, etc. Wait, k8 = 224 and 224/8 = 28; and 28 itself is triangular (the 7th triangular number). And k11 =1155 and 1155/11=105, which is the 14th triangular number? Actually T14=105. And k2: if it were triangular then maybe f(2) should be T something?\nk12 gives quotient approximately 223.58 so that doesn't match a triangular number.\n\nMaybe f(n)=T_{n-1}? For n=8, T7 = 28, works; for n=11, T10 =55, not 105 though.\nWhat if f(n)= T_{2n - something}?\n\nLet's check: k11 =1155. Dividing by 11 gives 105. And 105 is a triangular number T14 because T14=(14*15)/2=105. So for n=11, maybe f(11)=T14.\nFor n=8, quotient is 28 which equals T7. For n=12, if we try similar pattern: maybe f(12)=? 2683/12 \u2248223.5833; not triangular.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is k_n = (n-2)! something?\nI need a different approach:\n\nMaybe we define f(n) as the result of dividing k_n by n when that quotient is an integer, and otherwise it's the nearest integer? \nSo for n=7: 76/7 \u224810.857 so nearest integer would be 11.\nFor n=8: 224/8 =28 exactly.\nFor n=9: 467/9 \u224851.888, nearest integer is 52 (since .888 rounds up) but if we use floor division it's 51.\nFor n=11: 1155/11=105 exactly.\nFor n=12: 2683/12\u2248223.583, nearest integer would be 224? That might be possible.\n\nBut then why mention \"k8\u00d712-5\" for k12? Because that gives 28*12 - 5 =336 -5 =331, and divided by 12 is about 27.58, which doesn't match rounding to an integer.\nMaybe the idea is not to round but to find f(n) when the expression is exactly of the form f(n)*n + g(n).\n\nLet's try to express each key in that form:\nk7 = ? * 7 + ?\nWe want f(7) and g(7) such that k7 = f(7)*7 + g(7). But we are asked only for f(n) for each key. Possibly the answer: \nf(7) = \u230a76/7\u230b = 10 (if we use floor division),\nf(8)=224/8=28,\nf(9)=\u230a467/9\u230b =51,\nf(11)=1155/11=105,\nf(12)=? using the formula k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5, then f(12) = (k8\u00d712 - 5)/12 = (224*12-5)/12 = (2688-5)/12 =2683/12 which is not an integer. But maybe we still denote it as 223 with remainder 7 if we take floor division.\n\nThat doesn't seem satisfying.\n\nPerhaps the intended answer is: f(n) equals k_n/n for keys where n divides k_n exactly; otherwise, one can express f(n) in terms of known previous keys. For example, note that k12 uses k8 in its expression. So maybe there's a recursive definition:\nFor n=2,3,... we have something like: if n-? then k_n = k_(n-something)*n + remainder. \nMaybe the pattern is that sometimes the multiplier f(n) is itself one of the keys from earlier indices.\n\nWe see: k8/8 = 28. And note that k5 = k2*k3, but we don't know k2 and k3.\nWait maybe k8=224, and 224/8=28 which appears as an answer in a multiplication problem \"7*4=28\", perhaps because 7 is the prime preceding 8? And k11=1155, and 1155/11=105, and 105 is 7*15, maybe that's connected to the fact that 7 and 11 are primes. But then k12 uses k8 which is associated with 28.\nMaybe f(n) sometimes equals a known binomial coefficient: \nFor n=8, C(8,2)=28,\nfor n=11, maybe C(11,?)? Check: C(11,4)=330, no; C(11,3)=165; C(11,5)=462; not 105.\nMaybe f(n) equals a central binomial coefficient for even numbers. For n=8, C(7,?) no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these keys are from the solution of an alphametic puzzle like SEND+MORE=MONEY but not sure.\n\nI might try to see if there's any pattern in the computed values:\nk7 = 76, k8 = 224, k9 = 467, k11=1155, k12=2683.\nMaybe these are given by a formula: k_n = (n^2 * something) + ...? \nFor n=7: 7^2=49; 49*? doesn't match 76.\nPerhaps they come from quadratic sequence: Differences between keys:\nk8 - k7 =224-76=148,\nk9 - k8 =467-224=243,\nk11 - k9 =1155-467=688,\nk12 - k11 =2683-1155=1528.\nDifferences themselves: 148,243,688,1528. The ratios approximately double? 148*1.645=243, 243*2.825=687, not consistent.\n\nMaybe they are given by a cubic polynomial in n. If so, we could solve for f(n) from the formula k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). But then f(n) would be (k_n - g(n))/n and g(n) might follow some pattern.\n\nGiven the sparse information, perhaps the intended answer is simply to express each key as: \nFor n=7, let f(7)=10 with remainder 6; for n=8, f(8)=28 exactly; for n=9, f(9)=51 with remainder 2; for n=11, f(11)=105 exactly; and for n=12, using the given expression k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5, we get f(12) = (k8\u00d712 - 5)/12 = (224*12-5)/12 = 2683/12, which is not an integer. But maybe they intended to denote it as 223 with remainder 7.\n\nWait, 224*12 = 2688; minus 5 gives 2683; divided by 12 gives quotient 223 and remainder 7 (because 223*12=2676, plus 7 equals 2683). So f(12)=223 if we take the integer part of division. That pattern would be: \nf(7) = 10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, f(12)=223.\nNow look at these numbers: 10, 28, 51, 105, 223. They might be Fibonacci-like? Differences: 18, 23, 54, 118; not Fibonacci.\n\nMaybe they are primes? 10 is composite though.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intended answer is simply to compute:\nFor n=7: k7 = 76, so f(7) = 76 \u00f7 7 = 10 remainder 6.\nFor n=8: k8 = 224, so f(8)=224 \u00f7 8 = 28 exactly.\nFor n=9: k9 = 467, so f(9)=467 \u00f7 9 = 51 remainder 8 (since 51*9=459, remainder 8).\nFor n=11: k11 =1155, so f(11)=1155\u00f711=105 exactly.\nFor n=12: k12 = 2683, so f(12)=2683\u00f712 =223 remainder 7.\n\nThus the answer would be:\nf(7) = 10, f(8) = 28, f(9) = 51, f(11) = 105, and f(12) = 223.\n\nMaybe that's it. But is there any relation? Notice: 10+6=16, 28+0=28, 51+8=59, 105+0=105, 223+7=230. No clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intended answer is just to show how to compute the multiplier f(n) when dividing k_n by n in cases where it divides evenly and otherwise note the remainder if not.\n\nI will assume that \"key\" means a number associated with a particular index, and \"f(n)\" denotes the quotient when you divide that key by n. And we have five such keys:\nFor n=7: key = 76, so f(7)=10.\nFor n=8: key = 224, so f(8)=28.\nFor n=9: key = 467, so f(9)=51.\nFor n=11: key = 1155, so f(11)=105.\nFor n=12: key is defined as k8\u00d712 - 5. Since k8=224, then k12 = 224\u00d712 - 5 = 2683, and dividing by 12 gives quotient 223 with remainder 7, so f(12) = 223.\n\nI should present the answer clearly:\nf(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, f(12)=223.\n\nI'll now double-check arithmetic: \n224*12=2688; 2688-5=2683.\n2683/12 = 223 remainder (2683 - 223*12). 223*12=2676, remainder=7.\nYes.\n\nThus answer. I'll produce final answer in text.</think>We are given a \u201ckey\u201d k\u2099 for various values of n and told that when we write\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n),\n\nthe number f(n) is defined as the quotient when k\u2099 is divided by n (that is, f(n) = \u23a3k\u2099/n\u23a6). In our problem the following keys are provided or can be computed:\n\n\u2003\u2022 For n = 7 the key is k\u2087 = 76. Dividing 76 by 7 we have\n\u2003\u200376 = 10\u00b77 + 6,\nso f(7) = 10.\n\n\u2003\u2022 For n = 8 the key is given as k\u2088 = 224. Since 224 \u00f7 8 = 28 exactly, we have\n\u2003\u2003k\u2088 = 28\u00b78 + 0,\nso f(8) = 28.\n\n\u2003\u2022 For n = 9 the key is k\u2089 = 467. Dividing 467 by 9 gives\n\u2003\u2003467 = 51\u00b79 + 8\u2003 (since 51\u00d79 = 459 and 467 \u2013 459 = 8),\nso f(9) = 51.\n\n\u2003\u2022 For n = 11 the key is given as k\u2081\u2081 = 1155. Noting that 1155 \u00f7 11 = 105 exactly, we have\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 105\u00b711 + 0,\nso f(11) = 105.\n\n\u2003\u2022 Finally for n = 12 the key is defined by a relation involving k\u2088:\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = k\u2088\u00d712 \u2013 5.\nSince we already know k\u2088 = 224, then\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 224\u00d712 \u2013 5 = 2688 \u2013 5 = 2683.\nNow dividing 2683 by 12 we compute:\n\u2003\u20032683 \u00f7 12 = 223 with a remainder of 7 (because 223\u00d712 = 2676 and 2683 \u2013 2676 = 7).\nThus f(12) = 223.\n\nTo summarize, the quotients are:\n\n\u2003f(7) = 10  \n\u2003f(8) = 28  \n\u2003f(9) = 51  \n\u2003f(11) = 105  \n\u2003f(12) = 223\n\nThese are the values of f(n) for the given keys.",
