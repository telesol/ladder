  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The problem involves analyzing keys (k1 to k14) using modular arithmetic modulo 7, 11, and 13. The user also wants to check for patterns, such as which keys are divisible by 7 or 11, whether there's a cycle in the mod sequences, and predict the mod values for k15. Additionally, they mention using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) if patterns are found. \n\nStarting with the given information:\n\n**MOD 7 (k3):**\n- k1%7=1\n- k2%7=3\n- k3%7=0\n- k4%7=1\n- k5%7=0\n- k6%7=0\n- k7%7=6\n- k8%7=0\n- k9%7=5\n- k10%7=3\n- k11%7=0\n- k12%7=2\n- k13%7=5\n- k14%7=6\n\nWait a second, in the MOD 7 section, it mentions \"k3%7=0\". But the rest of the keys also have their mod 7 values listed. So maybe \"MOD 7 (k3)\" is just a heading, and the key numbers (k1 to k14) have their mod 7 residues listed. Similarly for MOD 11 and MOD 13.\n\n**MOD 11:**\n- k1%11=1\n- k2%11=3\n- k3%11=7\n- k4%11=8\n- k5%11=10\n- k6%11=5\n- k7%11=10\n- k8%11=4\n- k9%11=5\n- k10%11=8\n- k11%11=0\n- k12%11=10\n- k13%11=9\n- k14%11=9\n\n**MOD 13:**\nThe user wants us to calculate all k_n mod 13. Since the mod 7 and mod 11 residues are given for each key up to k14, maybe we can find a pattern or recurrence relation to compute mod 13, or perhaps there's a hidden pattern in the existing residues?\n\n**Pattern Search Questions:**\n\n1. **Which keys are divisible by 7?** The user lists k3, k5, k6, k8, k11. Let me verify that from the mod 7 residues:\n   - k3%7=0 \u2192 yes\n   - k5%7=0 \u2192 yes\n   - k6%7=0 \u2192 yes\n   - k8%7=0 \u2192 yes\n   - k11%7=0 \u2192 yes\n   So that's correct. The others (like k1, k2, etc.) don't have mod7=0 except those listed. Good.\n\n2. **Which keys are divisible by 11?** The user says only k11. Looking at mod11 residues:\n   - k11%11=0 \u2192 yes\n   All others have mod11 residues not 0 except k11. So that's correct.\n\n3. **Is there a cycle in the mod sequences?** Hmm, need to check if the residues modulo 7, 11, or 13 repeat periodically. Let's look at mod7 first. The mod7 residues from k1 to k14 are:\n\n1,3,0,1,0,0,6,0,5,3,0,2,5,6\n\nLooking for a cycle here. Let's see the sequence:\n\n1 (k1), 3 (k2), 0 (k3), 1 (k4), 0 (k5), 0 (k6), 6 (k7), 0 (k8), 5 (k9), 3 (k10), 0 (k11), 2 (k12), 5 (k13), 6 (k14)\n\nHmm, not obvious. Let's see if any subsequence repeats. From k1 to k7: 1,3,0,1,0,0,6. Then k8 is 0, which is similar to k3? Not sure. Let me check mod11 residues:\n\nmod11 residues from k1 to k14:\n1,3,7,8,10,5,10,4,5,8,0,10,9,9\n\nLooking for cycles here. Let's see:\n\nPositions 1-7: 1,3,7,8,10,5,10\n\nPositions 8-14:4,5,8,0,10,9,9\n\nNot obvious. Maybe mod13? But we don't have mod13 residues yet. Maybe need to compute mod13 first.\n\nWait, perhaps the keys themselves follow a recurrence relation? Since the problem mentions predicting k15 mod7, mod11, mod13, maybe the keys are part of a sequence with a linear recurrence?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are Fibonacci numbers or some other known sequence? Let me see if the residues can help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mod7 residues repeat every certain number of keys? Let's see the mod7 residues again:\n\nk1:1, k2:3, k3:0, k4:1, k5:0, k6:0, k7:6, k8:0, k9:5, k10:3, k11:0, k12:2, k13:5, k14:6\n\nLooking from the start, let's see if any pattern repeats. From k1 to k7: 1,3,0,1,0,0,6\n\nThen k8:0, k9:5, k10:3, k11:0, which is similar to k3, k4, k5, k6? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe every 7 keys? Let's see:\n\nk1 to k7: 1,3,0,1,0,0,6\n\nk8 to k14:0,5,3,0,2,5,6\n\nNot the same. Hmm.\n\nLooking at mod11 residues:\n\nk1:1, k2:3, k3:7, k4:8, k5:10, k6:5, k7:10, k8:4, k9:5, k10:8, k11:0, k12:10, k13:9, k14:9\n\nLooking at the sequence, maybe from k1 to k7: 1,3,7,8,10,5,10\n\nk8 to k14:4,5,8,0,10,9,9\n\nHmm, perhaps not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the keys are following a linear recurrence modulo each modulus? Like Fibonacci-like?\n\nSuppose the keys are part of a sequence where each term is the sum of previous terms mod something? Let's test mod7 first.\n\nSuppose there is a recurrence like kn+1 = (kn + something) mod7. Let's see:\n\nLooking at mod7:\n\nk1=1, k2=3. If it's Fibonacci, then k3 should be 1+3=4 mod7, but k3 is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another recurrence. Let me see:\n\nLooking at mod7 residues:\n\nLet me list the terms again:\n\nk1:1\n\nk2:3\n\nk3:0\n\nk4:1\n\nk5:0\n\nk6:0\n\nk7:6\n\nk8:0\n\nk9:5\n\nk10:3\n\nk11:0\n\nk12:2\n\nk13:5\n\nk14:6\n\nLooking at the sequence, perhaps every 7 terms? Let me see:\n\nTerm 7:6, term14:6. Hmm, 6 at k7 and k14. Maybe a cycle of 7? Let's see:\n\nFrom k1 to k7: 1,3,0,1,0,0,6\n\nk8 to k14:0,5,3,0,2,5,6\n\nNot quite the same, but maybe there's a different cycle length. Alternatively, maybe the cycle is longer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is related to the mod11 residues?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys correspond to some known sequence. Let's see:\n\nLooking at mod11 residues:\n\nk1 mod11=1, mod7=1. So possible that k1 is 1 mod7 and mod11? Maybe k1=1? Let's test.\n\nSuppose k1 is 1. Then k2 mod7=3 and mod11=3, so k2 could be 3? Let's see:\n\nIf k3 mod7=0 and mod11=7. Then possible k3 is 7 mod7 is 0, mod11 is 7 \u2192 yes. So k3 could be 7.\n\nk4 mod7=1, mod11=8. So possible k4 is 8 mod11 and 1 mod7.\n\nWhat number satisfies x \u22611 mod7 and x\u22618 mod11?\n\nSolving with CRT:\n\nLet\u2019s solve x \u22611 mod7 and x\u22618 mod11.\n\nLet x=7a+1. Then 7a+1 \u22618 mod11 \u21d27a \u22617 mod11 \u21d2a\u22611 mod11 (since 7^{-1} mod11 is 8 because 7*8=56\u22611 mod11). So a=11b+1. Thus x=7*(11b+1)+1=77b+8. So the smallest positive solution is 8. Thus k4=8? That works. Let me see if this is a possible sequence.\n\nContinuing, k5 mod7=0 and mod11=10. So x \u22610 mod7 and x\u226110 mod11.\n\nLet x=7c. Then 7c\u226110 mod11 \u21d27c\u226110 mod11 \u21d2c\u226110*7^{-1} mod11. As before, 7^{-1}=8 mod11. So c\u226110*8=80\u22613 mod11. So c=11d+3. Thus x=7*(11d+3)=77d+21. The smallest is 21. So k5=21?\n\nCheck mod7:21 mod7=0, mod11:21 mod11=10. Yes.\n\nk6 mod7=0 and mod11=5. So x\u22610 mod7, x\u22615 mod11.\n\nx=7e. 7e\u22615 mod11 \u21d2e\u22615*8 mod11 (since 7^{-1}=8). 5*8=40\u22617 mod11. So e=11f+7. Thus x=7*(11f+7)=77f+49. The smallest is 49. So k6=49.\n\nCheck mod7:49 mod7=0, mod11:49 mod11=5. Correct.\n\nk7 mod7=6 and mod11=10. Let's see. x\u22616 mod7 and x\u226110 mod11.\n\nLet x=7g+6. Then 7g+6\u226110 mod11 \u21d27g\u22614 mod11 \u21d2g\u22614*8 mod11 \u21d232 mod11\u226110 mod11. So g=11h+10. Thus x=7*(11h+10)+6=77h+76. The smallest is 76. 76 mod7:76-10*7=76-70=6, mod11=76-6*11=76-66=10. Correct. So k7=76?\n\nk8 mod7=0 and mod11=4. So x\u22610 mod7, x\u22614 mod11.\n\nx=7j. 7j\u22614 mod11 \u21d2j\u22614*8 mod11 \u21d232\u226110 mod11. So j=11k+10 \u21d2x=7*(11k+10)=77k+70. The smallest is 70. 70 mod7=0, mod11=70 mod11=70-6*11=4. Correct. So k8=70.\n\nk9 mod7=5 and mod11=5. So x\u22615 mod7 and mod11=5.\n\nSo x\u22615 mod7 and mod11=5. Let's solve:\n\nx\u22615 mod7 and mod11=5.\n\nLet x=7m+5. Then 7m+5\u22615 mod11 \u21d27m\u22610 mod11 \u21d2m\u22610 mod11 (since 7 and 11 coprime). Thus m=11n. So x=77n+5. The smallest is 5. But k9 is the 9th term. Let me see if 5 is possible. Let's check previous terms:\n\nWait, if up to k8 is 70, then k9 would need to be next term. Maybe the sequence is being built by some recurrence. Alternatively, maybe the keys are the Fibonacci sequence? Let me check:\n\nIf we consider Fibonacci:\n\nk1=1, k2=1, but here k2 is 3 mod7 and mod11=3, so maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe the keys follow a recurrence like kn = kn-1 + kn-2 or similar?\n\nLet me see. Suppose we try to assume a linear recurrence.\n\nLooking at the mod7 residues:\n\nk1=1, k2=3, k3=0. If it's a Fibonacci-like, then k3 =k1+k2 mod7 \u21921+3=4 mod7\u22600. Not.\n\nAlternatively kn = kn-1 + kn-2 mod something?\n\nWait, let me see mod11:\n\nk1=1, k2=3, k3=7. 1+3=4 mod11\u22607. Not Fibonacci.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another recurrence. Let me see differences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are following a specific recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions predicting k15 mod7, mod11, mod13, perhaps the keys form a linear recurrence modulo each modulus, and we can find the cycle length modulo each modulus.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions \"use Chinese Remainder Theorem if patterns found\", maybe the keys are following a linear recurrence sequence, and once we find the recurrence mod7 and mod11, we can combine them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the keys are numbers in a sequence where each term is the previous multiplied by some constant? Let's see mod7:\n\nk1=1, k2=3 (3=1*3), k3=0 (3*0?), no. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, mod11:\n\nk1=1, k2=3 (times 3?), then k3=7 (3*7/1?), not obvious.\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to first compute mod13 residues for all keys. Since the problem says \"MOD 13: Calculate all k_n %13\".\n\nTo compute mod13, we need to know the actual values of the keys, but since we only have their residues mod7 and mod11, perhaps there's a pattern or the keys follow a recurrence that can be used to compute mod13.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are the Fibonacci sequence starting with some initial terms?\n\nLet me check with Fibonacci:\n\nSuppose k1=1, k2=1, then k3=2 mod7 would be 2, but here k3 mod7=0. So not Fibonacci.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another recurrence. Let me see mod7:\n\nLooking at mod7 residues:\n\n1,3,0,1,0,0,6,0,5,3,0,2,5,6\n\nHmm, let me see if there's a pattern here. Let's see the transitions between terms:\n\nFrom k1 to k2: 1\u21923\n\nk2\u2192k3:3\u21920\n\nk3\u2192k4:0\u21921\n\nk4\u2192k5:1\u21920\n\nk5\u2192k6:0\u21920\n\nk6\u2192k7:0\u21926\n\nk7\u2192k8:6\u21920\n\nk8\u2192k9:0\u21925\n\nk9\u2192k10:5\u21923\n\nk10\u2192k11:3\u21920\n\nk11\u2192k12:0\u21922\n\nk12\u2192k13:2\u21925\n\nk13\u2192k14:5\u21926\n\nHmm, not obvious. Let me see mod11 residues:\n\n1,3,7,8,10,5,10,4,5,3,0,2,5,6\n\nLooking at mod11:\n\n1\u21923\u21927\u21928\u219210\u21925\u219210\u21924\u21925\u21923\u21920\u21922\u21925\u21926\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each term is the sum of previous two terms modulo something?\n\nLet me check mod7:\n\nk3 mod7=0. If k1+k2 mod7=1+3=4\u22600.\n\nk4 mod7=1. If k2+k3 mod7=3+0=3\u22601.\n\nk5 mod7=0. If k3+k4 mod7=0+1=1\u22600.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, maybe difference?\n\nk2 -k1 mod7=2, which is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, product?\n\nk1*k2 mod7=3 mod7, but k3 mod7=0, so no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is periodic modulo7 and modulo11.\n\nLooking at mod7 residues:\n\n1,3,0,1,0,0,6,0,5,3,0,2,5,6\n\nLet me see the sequence from k1 to k14 mod7:\n\n1,3,0,1,0,0,6,0,5,3,0,2,5,6\n\nLooking for a cycle. Let me check the first few terms:\n\n1,3,0,1,0,0,6,0,5,3,0,2,5,6\n\nAfter k7:6, then k8:0, which is similar to after k3:0, k4:1...\n\nWait, after k3:0,1,0,0,6,0,5,...\n\nAfter k11:0,2,5,6. Hmm, not the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, the period might be 12? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, the period modulo7 is 12? Let me see:\n\nFrom k1 to k14, it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe modulo7 has a period of 12, since 7 is prime, the period might be related to factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to try to find the recurrence relation.\n\nSuppose that the sequence follows a linear recurrence of order 2: kn = a*kn-1 + b*kn-2 mod7 and mod11.\n\nWe can try to solve for a and b using the known terms.\n\nLet's take mod7 first.\n\nUsing terms k1 to k4:\n\nk3 = a*k2 + b*k1 mod7\n\nk4 = a*k3 + b*k2 mod7\n\nPlugging in:\n\n0 = 3a + 1b mod7\n\n1 = 0a + 3b mod7 (since k4=1, k3=0, k2=3)\n\nWait:\n\nWait for k3:\n\nk3 = a*k2 + b*k1 mod7 \u21920 =3a +1b mod7\n\nk4 = a*k3 + b*k2 mod7 \u21921 =0a +3b mod7 \u21923b\u22611 mod7 \u2192 b \u2261 5 mod7 (since 3*5=15\u22611 mod7)\n\nSo b=5.\n\nThen plug into first equation: 3a +5 \u22610 mod7 \u21923a\u2261-5 mod7\u21923a\u22612 mod7. 3^{-1}=5 mod7 (since 3*5=15\u22611 mod7). Thus a\u22612*5=10\u22613 mod7. So a=3.\n\nThus the recurrence relation modulo7 would be kn = 3*kn-1 +5*kn-2 mod7.\n\nLet me check with next terms:\n\nk5 =3*k4 +5*k3 mod7 \u21923*1 +5*0=3 mod7. But k5 mod7 is 0. Not matching. Hmm, so this doesn't hold. Maybe order 2 isn't sufficient.\n\nAlternatively try order 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe order 1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's see mod11:\n\nLooking for recurrence relation.\n\nLet me try order 2 again mod11:\n\nk3=7, k2=3, k1=1.\n\nSo 7 = a*3 +b*1 mod11 \u21923a +b \u22617 mod11.\n\nk4=8= a*7 + b*3 mod11 \u21927a +3b \u22618 mod11.\n\nSo two equations:\n\n3a + b =7 mod11 --> equation1\n\n7a +3b =8 mod11 --> equation2\n\nMultiply equation1 by 3: 9a +3b =21 mod11\u21929a +3b \u226110 mod11\n\nSubtract equation2: (9a +3b)-(7a+3b)=2a \u226110-8=2 mod11 \u21d22a\u22612 mod11 \u21d2a\u22611 mod11.\n\nThen from equation1: 3*1 +b=7 mod11 \u21d2b=4 mod11.\n\nThus recurrence would be kn=1*kn-1 +4*kn-2 mod11.\n\nCheck with k5=10:\n\nk5=1*k4 +4*k3 mod11 \u21921*8 +4*7=8+28=36 mod11=36-3*11=3 mod11. But k5 mod11=10. Doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe order 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is not linear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is related to the Fibonacci numbers mod7 and mod11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the keys are the Fibonacci numbers starting from different initial terms.\n\nSuppose k1=1, k2=3, then:\n\nk3=1+3=4 mod7, but here k3 mod7 is 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k1=1, k2=3, k3=0, then k4=k3 +k2 mod7? 0+3=3 mod7, but k4 mod7 is 1. No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps kn = (kn-1 * kn-2) mod something. Let's see mod7:\n\nk1=1, k2=3, then k3=1*3=3 mod7, but actual is 0. Not.\n\nAlternatively, kn = kn-1 + kn-2 mod something.\n\nWait, let's see mod11:\n\nk1=1, k2=3, k3=7. 1+3=4 mod11\u22607. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each term is previous term multiplied by 3 mod something?\n\nk2=3=1*3 mod anything.\n\nk3=7: 3*3=9 mod something? If mod7: 9 mod7=2, but k3 mod7=0.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are following a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are the numbers 1,3,7,8,10,49,... but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem requires calculating mod13 for each key, perhaps the keys are numbers from 1 to 14, but mod13:\n\nk1 mod13=1, k2 mod13=3,... but we need to know the actual numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the keys are the Fibonacci numbers starting with k1=1 and k2=3. Let me check:\n\nk1=1, k2=3, k3=4, k4=7, k5=11, k6=18, k7=29, k8=47, k9=76, k10=123, k11=199, k12=322, k13=521, k14=843.\n\nLet's compute these mod7 and mod11:\n\nk1 mod7=1, mod11=1: matches.\n\nk2 mod7=3, mod11=3: matches.\n\nk3=4 mod7=4\u22600 (given k3 mod7=0). Doesn't fit. So no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are the numbers 1,3,7,8, 0 mod7? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions \"MOD13: Calculate all k_n %13\", perhaps the question is actually in the context of a sequence defined by some recurrence that we can derive from the given mod7 and mod11 residues?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are the numbers corresponding to the given residues mod7 and mod11. For example, for k1, the residue mod7 is1 and mod11 is1, so k1=1.\n\nk2 mod7=3 and mod11=3 \u21d2k2=3.\n\nk3 mod7=0 and mod11=7 \u21d2k3=7.\n\nk4 mod7=1 and mod11=8 \u21d2k4=8 (since 8 mod7=1).\n\nk5 mod7=0 and mod11=10 \u21d2k5=10 mod7 is 3, but needs mod7=0. So solving x\u22610 mod7 and x\u226110 mod11.\n\nFind x=7a \u226110 mod11 \u21d27a\u226110 mod11 \u21d2a\u226110*(7^{-1} mod11). 7^{-1}=8 mod11 (7*8=56\u22611 mod11). So a\u226110*8=80\u22613 mod11 \u21d2a=11b+3 \u21d2x=7*(11b+3)=77b+21. The smallest positive is 21. So k5=21.\n\nk6 mod7=0 and mod11=5 \u21d2x\u22610 mod7 and x\u22615 mod11.\n\nx=7a \u22615 mod11 \u21d27a\u22615 \u21d2a\u22615*8=40\u22617 mod11 \u21d2a=11b+7 \u21d2x=77b+49. The smallest is49. So k6=49.\n\nk7 mod7=6 and mod11=10 \u21d2x\u22616 mod7 and x\u226110 mod11.\n\nFind x=7a+6. 7a+6 \u226110 mod11 \u21d27a \u22614 mod11 \u21d2a\u22614*(8)=32\u226110 mod11 \u21d2a=11b+10 \u21d2x=7*(11b+10)+6=77b+76. So smallest is76. So k7=76.\n\nk8 mod7=0 and mod11=4 \u21d2x\u22610 mod7 and mod11=4.\n\nx=7a\u22614 mod11 \u21d27a\u22614 \u21d2a\u22614*8=32\u226110 mod11 \u21d2a=11b+10 \u21d2x=77b+70. Smallest is70. Thus k8=70.\n\nk9 mod7=5 and mod11=5 \u21d2x\u22615 mod7 and mod11=5.\n\nSolve x\u22615 mod7 and mod11.\n\nx=7a+5. 7a+5 \u22615 mod11 \u21d27a\u22610 mod11 \u21d2a\u22610 mod11 \u21d2a=11b \u21d2x=77b+5. Smallest is5. But mod7 is5, yes. So k9=5?\n\nWait but k9 mod7 is5 and mod11=5. 5 mod7=5 and mod11=5. So yes, 5 is possible. But then proceeding:\n\nk10 mod7=3 and mod11=3 \u21d2x\u22613 mod7 and mod11=3 \u21d23 mod73 would be3, but 3 mod11=3. So k10=3? But conflicting with previous terms? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, this approach assumes that each term is the smallest positive integer satisfying the congruences, but it might not be the case. Alternatively, the terms could be increasing, so perhaps we need to take the minimal positive solutions greater than previous terms.\n\nLet's try:\n\nk1=1,\n\nk2=3,\n\nk3=7,\n\nk4=8,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=70 (but 70 is less than76, so maybe next solution? 77b+70, next is77+70=147. So k8=147? Wait, but mod7=0 and mod11=4. 147 mod11: 147/11=13*11=143, 147-143=4. Yes. So maybe k8=147. But then that would make the sequence jump. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are defined by their residues mod7 and mod11, but not necessarily the minimal numbers. The problem says \"Calculate all k_n %13\" so perhaps we need to find each k_n mod13 given their mod7 and mod11 residues.\n\nSince mod7 and mod11 are co-prime, by Chinese Remainder Theorem, each k_n is uniquely determined mod77. So if we can find k_n mod77, then we can find mod13.\n\nSo to compute k_n mod13, first compute k_n mod7 and mod11, then use Chinese Remainder Theorem to find mod77, then mod13.\n\nWait but the problem states \"MOD13: Calculate all k_n %13\". So likely, for each n from 1 to 14 (since the user listed residues up to k14 mod11=6), we need to compute their mod13.\n\nWait the user provided residues for each term up to k14 mod7 and mod11:\n\nFrom the initial problem description:\n\nThe user provided a list of residues for each term from k1 to k14 mod7 and mod11:\n\nk1: mod7=1, mod11=1\n\nk2: mod7=3, mod11=3\n\nk3: mod7=0, mod11=7\n\nk4: mod7=1, mod11=8\n\nk5: mod7=0, mod11=10\n\nk6: mod7=0, mod11=5\n\nk7: mod7=6, mod11=10\n\nk8: mod7=0, mod11=4\n\nk9: mod7=5, mod11=5\n\nk10: mod7=3, mod11=3\n\nk11: mod7=0, mod11=0\n\nk12: mod7=2, mod11=2\n\nk13: mod7=5, mod11=5\n\nk14: mod7=6, mod11=6\n\nSo for each n from 1 to 14, we have k_n mod7 and mod11, so we can compute k_n mod77, then mod13.\n\nLet me proceed step by step for each term.\n\nStarting with k1:\n\nk1 mod7=1, mod11=1.\n\nFind x \u22611 mod7 and x\u22611 mod11. Since 1 mod77 is 1, so k1 mod77=1. Thus mod13:1 mod13=1.\n\nk2 mod7=3, mod11=3.\n\nx\u22613 mod7 and mod11. The solution is x\u22613 mod77. Thus mod13: 3 mod13=3.\n\nk3 mod7=0, mod11=7.\n\nFind x\u22610 mod7, x\u22617 mod11.\n\nExpress x=7a. Then 7a\u22617 mod11 \u21d27(a-1)\u22610 mod11 \u21d2a\u22611 mod11 (since 7 and11 coprime). Thus a=11b+1 \u21d2x=7*(11b+1)=77b+7. So mod77:7 \u21d2 mod13:7 mod13=7.\n\nk4 mod7=1, mod11=8.\n\nx\u22611 mod7, x\u22618 mod11.\n\nLet x=7a+1. Then 7a+1\u22618 mod11 \u21d27a\u22617 mod11 \u21d2a\u22611 mod11 (since7^{-1}=8 mod11, so a\u22611*8=8? Wait 7a\u22617 \u21d2a\u22611 mod11 (since 7*1=7 mod11). So a=11b+1 \u21d2x=7*(11b+1)+1=77b+8.
