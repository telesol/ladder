They are defined as \"k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12\". There is a pattern that sometimes index appears in formula. We see examples: k12 = k8 * 12 - 5 => which implies that for k12, f(12) might be something like (k8/?) But wait: \"k8 = 28 \u00d7 8\" so then for n=8, we have \"k8 = 28*8\", meaning that in the representation k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), for n=8, we get f(8)=28 and maybe g(8) = something? But they said \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" then computed 224/8=28. So apparently, if we assume that pattern holds: k_n = f(n)*n + some constant g(n), then for n=8, it's exactly divisible by 8, so f(8)=k8/8.\n\nFor n=11, similarly \"k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ?\" then 1155/11=105 integer, so f(11)=105. For k12, check: k12/12 would be not an integer but if you consider the formula from observation (k8 * 12 - 5) then dividing by 12 gives something else? Let's re-read that part:\n\n\"5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". So apparently, the formula for k12 is given as k12 = (k8*12 - 5). And we already know k8=28*8 so that equals 28*96 - 5 = 2688 - 5 = 2683. They are checking if there's a pattern where k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) for some functions f and g.\n\nThe question \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly means: For keys such as n=7, n=8, etc., compute the quotient when dividing k_n by n (or maybe f(n)= integer part?) from given numbers: \n\nGiven are:\n- k5 = k2 * k3. But that doesn't directly give a representation of the form f(5)*5 + g(5). Possibly we need to infer function f for various keys.\n\nLet's see if there is any pattern among the observed values. The text gives:\n\nFor n=7: k7 is computed as ? \u00d7 7 + ?. It says \"76/7 = 10.86\", which seems like dividing by 7, but then it's not integer so f(7) would be something fractional maybe? But they are checking if the index appears in formula.\n\nWe have:\n- For n=8: k8 = 28 \u00d7 8, so f(8)=28.\n- For n=11: k11 = 105 \u00d7 11, so f(11)=105.\n- For n=12: k12 is given as k8\u00d712 -5, and with k8=28*8 gives 2683. And then 2683/12 approx equals 223.58? So if we try to express it in the form f(n)*n + g(n), then f(12) would be 223 and remainder maybe is something like 12 - (5)? Let's see: If k12 = f(12)*12 + g(12), and from k8*12-5, that implies 2683 = f(12)*12 + g(12). The quotient 2683/12 is not an integer because remainder exists. But maybe the intended pattern is something like if n divides into k_n then f(n) equals k_n/n? For n=8 and n=11 we get integers, but for others we don't.\n\nMaybe the idea is that sometimes you can factor out the index from k_n (i.e., k_n divided by n yields an integer, which they denote as f(n)) and sometimes not. And the question: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly means: For keys where it's divisible, do so.\n\nObserving:\n- k8 = 224 \u2192 Dividing gives 224/8=28.\n- k11 = 1155 \u2192 Dividing gives 1155/11=105.\n- And then they note: k12 is not clean if dividing by 12? Because 2683/12 is fractional. But maybe there's a pattern that f(n) might be related to the product of previous keys' f values or something.\n\nLet me try to re-read carefully: \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\" suggests that some keys are products, some follow linear formulas with index n. They observe that for k5 it equals k2 * k3 (maybe because 2 and 3 add up to 5) and for k12 it equals k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (which is like using index 12 in formula). So perhaps the idea is: There's a pattern where sometimes the key is defined as product of previous keys, but sometimes as linear combination with factor n.\n\nThey then test some candidates:\n1. For n=7: They try k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? and compute 76/7 \u224810.86 not an integer.\n2. For n=8: k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? and compute 224/8 = 28 exactly, so f(8)=28.\n3. For n=9: k9 computed as 467/9 \u224851.89, not clean.\n4. For n=11: k11 computed as 1155/11 =105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\n5. For n=12: k12 computed as ? \u00d7 12 + ? and found 2683/12 \u2248223.58, but then they note that the formula using index 12 is k8\u00d712 - 5 equals 2683.\n\nSo we see: for n=8, f(8)=28; for n=11, f(11)=105; for n=12, if we express it as \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\", then maybe we can determine f(12) by rewriting k8\u00d712 - 5 in the form f(12)*12 + something. Let's try: k8 * 12 - 5 = (28*8)*12 - 5 = 2688 - 5 = 2683. Now if we want to express it as f(12)*12 + g(12), one natural candidate is f(12) = 223, because 223*12=2676, then remainder is 7? Let's check: 223 * 12 = 2676; subtract from 2683 gives 7. But that doesn't seem to follow the pattern (maybe we want a constant remainder g(n) independent of n? But maybe not.)\n\nLet me try to find the possible pattern. They are asking \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly they mean: For keys where k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), compute the function f(n). So what's f(n)? Perhaps it is determined by previous keys' f values?\n\nWe have:\n- For n=8, f(8)=28.\n- For n=11, f(11)=105.\nMaybe for n=12, if expressed in that form, then f(12) might be something like 223? But they computed k12/12 = 2683/12 \u2248223.58 so not an integer.\n\nWait re-read: \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ?\" then they compute \"2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". This suggests that if we set it up as f(12)*12 + g(12), perhaps we choose f(12)=28 because of the use of k8? Because k8=28*8. But then k12 would be 28 * 12 - something equals 336 - something equals? That doesn't match.\n\nMaybe the idea is: sometimes the product pattern yields a number that can also be represented as a linear function in n, where the coefficient f(n) appears to be given by previous keys' \"f\" values. For example, for k5 = k2 * k3, maybe then if we assume a representation k5 = f(5)*5 + g(5), then what is f(5)? Possibly f(5)= something like f(2)*f(3) or some combination.\n\nWait, let's try to guess: We have keys k2, k3, k8, k11. They gave the following values: \n- k8 = 28 \u00d7 8 (so maybe k8=224)\n- k11 = 105\u00d711 (so k11=1155)\n\nThey might also be known as \"k2\" and \"k3\"? But we don't have their values explicitly in this text. We do see: k12 = k8*12 - 5, so if k8=224 then k12=2683.\n\nAnd earlier: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\". So presumably the keys are defined by some recursion or pattern? Maybe it's a sequence of \"keys\" that are generated in a puzzle. I recall sometimes puzzles like this have keys: k1, k2, k3,... etc. There is maybe known sequence: 4, 5, 6, ... But not sure.\n\nWait, what do we know? They give explicit values for some keys:\n- k8 = 28 \u00d7 8 so k8=224.\n- k11 = 105\u00d711 so k11=1155.\n- k12 = k8*12 - 5 = (28*8)*12 - 5 = 2683.\n- For others: k7 is 76? They computed \"76/7 =10.86\", so maybe k7=76 exactly.\n- k9 is 467? Because they mention \"467/9 = 51.89\". So likely k9=467.\n- What about k5? They say k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3, but we don't know the values of k2 and k3.\n\nSo we have keys: k5, k7, k8 (224), k9 (467), k11 (1155), k12 (2683). Possibly also k2, k3, etc. But question: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nMaybe it's a pattern where if k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then f(n) is essentially the integer quotient when you divide k_n by n, if that division yields an integer result. So we can compute:\n\nFor key 7: 76/7 = 10 remainder something? Let's compute 76 divided by 7 exactly: 7*10=70 remainder 6. So then f(7)=10 and g(7)=6.\n\nFor key 8: 224/8=28, so f(8)=28 and g(8)=0.\nFor key 9: 467/9: compute division: 9 * 51 = 459, remainder 8. So then f(9)=51 and g(9)=8.\nFor key 11: 1155/11=105 exactly, so f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\nFor key 12: k12 is given by formula k8\u00d712 - 5 = (224)*12 - 5 = 2688-5=2683. Dividing 2683 by 12: 12*223 = 2676, remainder 7. So then f(12)=223 and g(12)=7.\n\nAnd what about key 5? k5 is not given a numeric value explicitly, but if we assume it equals k2*k3, maybe we can deduce something? But maybe the question expects us to compute only for keys where division yields integer values or pattern. The text says: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" That suggests perhaps we need to extract f(7), f(8), f(9), f(11), and f(12). And possibly also k2, k3 if needed? But then they are only interested in the ones where the index appears.\n\nLet's check: \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula\" suggests that sometimes we have a term like n multiplied by something. For keys 8, 11, and maybe others that come out clean when divided by the index.\n\nWe computed:\n- For key 7: f(7)=76//7 = 10 with remainder 6.\n- For key 8: f(8)=224/8=28 exactly.\n- For key 9: f(9)=467/9 = 51 remainder 8, so f(9)=51.\n- For key 11: f(11)=1155/11=105 exactly.\n- For key 12: f(12)=2683/12 = integer part is 223 remainder 7.\n\nSo maybe the answer is:\nk_7 = 10*7 + 6, so f(7) = 10.\nk_8 = 28*8 + 0, so f(8) = 28.\nk_9 = 51*9 + 8, so f(9) = 51.\nk_11 = 105*11 + 0, so f(11)=105.\nk_12 = 223*12 + 7, so f(12)=223.\n\nLet me check: for k_7, 10*7=70 then plus remainder 6 equals 76. For k_9, 51*9=459 then plus 8 equals 467. For k_11, 105*11=1155 exactly. For k_12, 223*12=2676 then plus 7 equals 2683.\n\nSo these are the computed f(n) values if we assume that division yields a quotient and remainder representation.\n\nThe question: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly they want just the quotient part f(n).\n\nThus answer:\n\nFor keys:\nk7 = 10\u00d77 + 6, so f(7)=10.\nk8 = 28\u00d78 + 0, so f(8)=28.\nk9 = 51\u00d79 + 8, so f(9)=51.\nk11=105\u00d711+0, so f(11)=105.\nk12=223\u00d712+7, so f(12)=223.\n\nBut what about k5? We don't have its numeric value. Perhaps we can deduce it if we know k2 and k3? But not provided in text, so likely answer: \"We note that only some keys appear to follow a linear pattern with index multiplied by coefficient.\" The ones that yield an integer quotient are key 8 and key 11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer should be:\nf(5) is unknown because k5 = k2*k3.\nFor key7: f(7)=10 (with remainder 6).\nFor key8: f(8)=28.\nFor key9: f(9)=51.\nFor key11: f(11)=105.\nFor key12: using the formula, f(12) can be deduced to be 223.\n\nI wonder if there's a deeper pattern. Notice that f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, f(12)=223. Are these numbers special? Differences: \n28 - 10 =18; 51-28=23; then from key9 to key11 skip key10 maybe? k5 is not in order.\n\nMaybe I should list keys in increasing order: k2, k3 might be something like f(2) and f(3). k4 may be something. But only keys provided are k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is simply:\n- For key 7 (n=7), f(7)=10.\n- For key 8 (n=8), f(8)=28.\n- For key 9 (n=9), f(9)=51.\n- For key 11 (n=11), f(11)=105.\n- For key 12 (n=12), f(12)=223.\n\nI will answer that. I'll mention: \"When we express k_n in the form f(n)*n + g(n), then for n = 7,8,9,11, and 12, we find:\nk_7 = 10*7 + 6 \u2192 f(7)=10.\nk_8 = 28*8 + 0 \u2192 f(8)=28.\nk_9 = 51*9 + 8 \u2192 f(9)=51.\nk_11=105*11 + 0 \u2192 f(11)=105.\nk_12=223*12 + 7 \u2192 f(12)=223.\"\n\nI wonder if we need to provide any explanation of how these were computed. I'll say: \"Divide k_n by n and take the quotient as f(n). For example, k8 is 224, so dividing 224 by 8 gives exactly 28, making f(8)=28.\" And similar for others.\n\nI can also note that some keys (like k5) might be defined differently (by product of other keys), but they don't seem to fit the linear pattern with the index n.\n\nThus final answer: \nf(7)=10; f(8)=28; f(9)=51; f(11)=105; f(12)=223.</think>We can \u201cpeel\u2010off\u201d a factor of n from many of the keys if they happen to be divisible by their index. In other words, if we write\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n)\n\nthen for some n the division k\u2099/n is exact (or at least gives an integer quotient f(n)).\n\nIn the examples given the numbers are:\n\n\u2022 For key 7: It turns out that k\u2087 = 76. Dividing, we get\n\u2003\u200376 \u00f7 7 = 10 with remainder 6.\nThus one may write\n\u2003\u2003k\u2087 = 10\u00b77 + 6,\nso f(7) = 10.\n\n\u2022 For key 8: We are told that k\u2088 = 28\u00d78, i.e. k\u2088 = 224 exactly. Then\n\u2003\u2003224 \u00f7 8 = 28 with zero remainder.\nSo we write\n\u2003\u2003k\u2088 = 28\u00b78 + 0,\nand f(8) = 28.\n\n\u2022 For key 9: It is given that k\u2089 = 467, and indeed\n\u2003\u2003467 \u00f7 9 = 51 with a remainder of 8 (since 51\u00d79 = 459 and 467 \u2013 459 = 8).\nThus,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2089 = 51\u00b79 + 8,\nso f(9) = 51.\n\n\u2022 For key 11: We have k\u2081\u2081 = 105\u00d711, i.e. k\u2081\u2081 = 1155 exactly.\nThen\n\u2003\u20031155 \u00f7 11 = 105 with no remainder.\nThat is,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 105\u00b711 + 0,\nso f(11) = 105.\n\n\u2022 For key 12: It is defined by a formula using the index itself. In fact, one rule is that\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = k\u2088\u00d712 \u2013 5.\nSince we already found k\u2088 = 224, then\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 224\u00d712 \u2013 5 = 2688 \u2013 5 = 2683.\nDividing by 12 gives\n\u2003\u20032683 \u00f7 12 = 223 with remainder 7 (because 223\u00d712 = 2676 and 2683 \u2013 2676 = 7).\nSo we write\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 223\u00b712 + 7,\nand hence f(12) = 223.\n\nThus, the values of f(n) for these keys are:\n\n\u2003\u2003f(7) = 10  \n\u2003\u2003f(8) = 28  \n\u2003\u2003f(9) = 51  \n\u2003\u2003f(11) = 105  \n\u2003\u2003f(12) = 223\n\nThis shows that in some cases the key\u2019s \u201ccoefficient\u201d (the factor multiplying n) is given by f(n), and sometimes the division k\u2099/n yields an exact integer (with zero remainder).",
