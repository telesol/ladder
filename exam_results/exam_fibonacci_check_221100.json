  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence, which means that each term is a linear combination of the two previous terms. The problem mentions testing with k\u2087 = 76 and k\u2088 = 224, and they want to know if there exist integers a and b such that:\n\nFor k\u2087 = 76:\n76 = a\u00d7k\u2086 + b\u00d7k\u2085\nBut wait, hold on, the problem states the equations as:\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\nand\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n\nHmm, so maybe they are considering k\u2086 = 49 and k\u2085 = 21? That must be the case. So the previous terms are given as k\u2085 = 21 and k\u2086 = 49. Then k\u2087 is 76 and k\u2088 is 224. The question is whether there exist integers a and b such that 76 = 49a + 21b and 224 = 76a + 49b. \n\nFirst, let's write down the two equations:\n\n1) 49a + 21b = 76\n\n2) 76a + 49b = 224\n\nWe need to solve this system of equations for a and b. Since the problem mentions integers, we need to see if there are integer solutions here. \n\nLet me first try to solve these equations step by step. Let's denote equation 1 and equation 2. \n\nLet me try to solve equation 1 for one variable and substitute into equation 2. Maybe solve equation 1 for a in terms of b.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n49a = 76 - 21b\n=> a = (76 - 21b)/49\n\nHmm, but that might not be the best way. Alternatively, maybe use elimination. Let's try multiplying the first equation by 76 and the second equation by 49 so that coefficients of a can be matched?\n\nWait, maybe that's too big. Alternatively, let me try to set up the equations for elimination.\n\nLet me write equations:\n\nEquation 1: 49a +21b =76\n\nEquation 2:76a +49b=224\n\nLet me try to eliminate one variable. Let's try to eliminate 'a'. To do that, multiply equation 1 by 76 and equation 2 by 49:\n\nEquation1 *76: 49*76 a +21*76 b =76*76\n\nEquation2 *49:76*49 a +49*49 b =224*49\n\nNow subtract the two equations:\n\nEquation1*76 - Equation2*49:\n\n(49*76a -76*49a) + (21*76b -49*49b) =76\u00b2 - 224*49\n\nThe first term cancels out (49*76a -76*49a =0)\n\nSo, the remaining terms:\n\n21*76b - 49\u00b2 b =76\u00b2 -224*49\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\n21*76 = 21*(70+6) = 21*70 +21*6 = 1470 +126 =1596\n\n49\u00b2 =2401\n\nSo left side: (1596 -2401)b = (1596-2401)b = (-805)b\n\nRight side:76\u00b2 -224*49\n\nCompute 76\u00b2: 76*76 = 5776\n\n224*49: let's compute 224*50 =11200, subtract 224 gives 11200 -224 =10976\n\nThus right side: 5776 -10976 = -5200\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n-805b = -5200\n\nTherefore, b = (-5200)/(-805) = 5200/805\n\nLet me simplify this fraction. Let's see:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5 first:\n\n5200 \u00f75 =1040\n\n805 \u00f75=161\n\nSo now 1040/161\n\nCheck if 161 divides 1040:\n\n161*6=966, 1040-966=74\n\nSo 1040=161*6 +74\n\nHmm, not divisible. Let's see GCD of 1040 and 161.\n\nFind GCD(161,1040). 161 divides into 1040 how many times?\n\n161*6=966, 1040-966=74. Now GCD(161,74)\n\n161 \u00f774 =2*74=148, remainder 13\n\nGCD(74,13). 74 \u00f713=5*13=65, remainder 9\n\nGCD(13,9). 13 \u00f79=1*9 +4\n\nGCD(9,4). 9 \u00f74=2*4 +1\n\nGCD(4,1). Which is 1.\n\nSo GCD is 1. Therefore, 1040/161 reduces to 1040/161. Which is approximately 6.453...\n\nHmm, that's not an integer. Since the problem asks for integer a and b, this fraction is not an integer. Therefore, maybe there is no integer solution?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me check again.\n\nFirst, in the elimination step:\n\nOriginal equations:\n\n1)49a +21b =76\n\n2)76a +49b =224\n\nMultiply equation1 by 76:\n\n49*76 a +21*76 b =76*76\n\nMultiply equation2 by49:\n\n76*49 a +49*49 b =224*49\n\nSubtract equation2*49 from equation1*76:\n\n(49*76 a -76*49 a) + (21*76 b -49\u00b2 b) =76\u00b2 -224*49\n\nYes, first term cancels, so:\n\n21*76 b -49\u00b2 b =76\u00b2 -224*49\n\nCompute 21*76:\n\n21*70=1470, 21*6=126, so total 1596\n\n49\u00b2=2401\n\nSo left side: 1596b -2401b = (1596-2401)b = (-805)b\n\nRight side:\n\n76\u00b2 = 5776\n\n224*49 =224*(50-1)=224*50 -224=11200-224=10976\n\nSo 5776 -10976= -5200\n\nSo indeed, -805b = -5200 \u2192 b=5200/805 \u22486.453. Not integer.\n\nHmm, so that suggests there's no integer solution for b. Therefore, with the given equations, there is no integer a and b that satisfy both equations. So the answer is no? But maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try solving for a and b using substitution.\n\nLet me try solving equation1 for a:\n\nFrom equation1: 49a =76 -21b \u2192 a=(76 -21b)/49\n\nThen substitute into equation2:\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nReplace a with (76 -21b)/49:\n\n76*(76 -21b)/49 +49b =224\n\nMultiply through by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49\u00b2 b =224*49\n\nCompute each term:\n\n76*(76 -21b) =76\u00b2 -76*21b\n\n49\u00b2 b = 2401b\n\n224*49=10976 as before.\n\nSo:\n\n76\u00b2 -76*21b +2401b =10976\n\nCompute 76\u00b2 =5776\n\n76*21 = 1596\n\nThus:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b =10976\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2401b -1596b) = 805b\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n5776 +805b =10976\n\nSubtract 5776:\n\n805b =10976 -5776 =5200\n\nThus b=5200/805, which is same as before, so 5200 divided by 805. Let me check if this reduces to a fraction with integer numerator and denominator?\n\nWait, 5200 divided by 805. Let me see 805*6=4830, so 5200-4830=370, so 5200=805*6 +370. Then 370/805 simplifies?\n\nWait maybe 805 divides into 5200 how many times? Let me check:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n5200 /5 =1040\n\n805 /5=161\n\nSo 1040/161. 161 is 7\u00d723, 1040 divided by 7? 1040/7 is 148.57\u2026 Not integer. So yeah, the fraction is 1040/161 which is not an integer. So b is not integer. Therefore, there are no integer solutions. \n\nHmm. So that suggests that the recurrence with integer coefficients a and b does not hold?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows non-integer a and b? But the question says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So the answer would be no? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the previous terms. Wait, the problem says \"For k7 =76: 76 =a\u00d749 +b\u00d721\". So maybe k5=21 and k6=49? Then k7=76, k8=224. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the setup. Let me check the equations again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem didn't specify the previous terms, so maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The problem says:\n\n\"For k7 = 76:\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n224 = 76a + 49b\"\n\nSo they are setting up the equations as if k5=21, k6=49, then k7=76 and k8=224. So the equations are correct. Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation here, it seems like there is no integer solution. \n\nAlternatively, maybe fractions? Let me see what a and b would be if non-integer. Let me do that.\n\nFrom above, b =5200/805 \u22486.453, and then a would be (76 -21b)/49.\n\nPlugging in b\u22486.453,\n\n21*6.453\u2248135.513\n\n76 -135.513\u2248-59.513\n\na \u2248-59.513 /49 \u2248-1.214\n\nSo a\u2248-1.214, b\u22486.453. Not integers. So if the problem requires integers, then no solution. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows real numbers a and b? But the question specifically says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So the answer is no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for real numbers, but then the question is a bit strange. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's question is: \"Does the sequence follow a recurrence like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\" and then they set up the equations with k\u2087 and k\u2088 and ask if we can find integer a and b. So the user is probably expecting to see if such integers exist. Since they don't, then the answer would be no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is part of a larger sequence where previous terms are different? But according to the given equations, they are using k5=21 and k6=49, so that is fixed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a mistake in the problem? Maybe the values given are different? Let me see if with different a and b maybe fractions could work, but the question specifies integers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a calculation mistake here. Let me try solving the equations again:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me try to use another method. Let's compute the determinant of the system.\n\nThe system can be written as:\n\n[49 21][a]   = [76]\n\n[76 49][b]     [224]\n\nThe determinant D is (49)(49) - (21)(76) = 49\u00b2 -21\u00d776\n\nCompute 49\u00b2: 2401\n\n21\u00d776: 21*(70+6)=1470 +126=1596\n\nSo D=2401 -1596= 805\n\nThen, using Cramer's rule,\n\na = ( |76   21| ) / D\n\n        |224 49|\n\nWhich is (76*49 -21*224)/805\n\nSimilarly, b = ( |49   76| ) / D\n\n              |76  224|\n\nWhich is (49*224 -76*76)/805\n\nCompute a:\n\n76*49= 3724 (since 70*49=3430, 6*49=294; 3430+294=3724)\n\n21*224=21*(200+24)=4200 +504=4704\n\nSo numerator for a is 3724 -4704 =-980\n\nThus, a= -980 /805= simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: -196/161\n\nSame as before.\n\nFor b:\n\n49*224= 49*(200+24)=9800 +1176=10976\n\n76*76=5776\n\nThus numerator is 10976 -5776=5200\n\nThus b=5200/805, same as before.\n\nSo same results. So indeed, both a and b are fractions, not integers. Therefore, there are no integer solutions. \n\nTherefore, the answer is no, there do not exist integers a and b such that the recurrence holds. \n\nHowever, the user also mentions \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\". So maybe the problem allows a constant term c? Let me check that. \n\nThe user says \"if there's a recurrence, we can predict k15, k16!\" So maybe it's a linear recurrence with constant term. Let me see if adding a constant term c allows integer solutions.\n\nSo now, the equations would be:\n\nFor k7 =76: 76 = a\u00d7k\u2086 + b\u00d7k\u2085 +c \u2192 76 =49a +21b +c\n\nFor k8 =224: 224= a\u00d7k\u2087 +b\u00d7k\u2086 +c \u2192224=76a +49b +c\n\nSo now we have two equations with three variables a,b,c. So we need another equation. But perhaps they can be consistent with the previous terms?\n\nWait, maybe the user is suggesting to consider a linear recurrence with constant term. But since we only have two equations (for k7 and k8), but three variables (a,b,c), we can choose c as a parameter, but then there are infinitely many solutions. Unless there is a condition that the recurrence should hold for previous terms as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to set up equations such that the recurrence holds for all terms, but since we don't have more data, perhaps we can choose c such that the equations are consistent?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to see whether with a constant term, but with integer coefficients?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to check first without c, then with c? Let me try with c.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b +c =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b +c =224\n\nSubtract Equation1 from Equation2:\n\n(76a -49a) + (49b -21b) + (c -c) =224 -76\n\n27a +28b =148\n\nSo 27a +28b =148. Now, with this equation, we can look for integer solutions a,b.\n\nAdditionally, from Equation1: c =76 -49a -21b\n\nSo if we can find integers a and b such that 27a +28b =148, then c will also be integer.\n\nLet me see if this equation has integer solutions.\n\nWe can write 27a =148 -28b \u2192 a=(148 -28b)/27\n\nWe need (148 -28b) divisible by 27.\n\nLet me see possible integer values for b.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me let 148 -28b \u22610 mod27\n\nSo 148 mod27: 27*5=135 \u2192148-135=13 \u2192148 \u226113 mod27\n\n28b mod27= (28 mod27)*b=1*b mod27\n\nThus equation is:\n\n13 -b \u22610 mod27 \u2192 -b \u2261-13 mod27 \u2192b\u226113 mod27\n\nThus, possible solutions are b=13 +27k, for integer k.\n\nSimilarly, since a must also be integer:\n\na=(148 -28b)/27\n\nLet's plug in b=13:\n\na=(148 -28*13)/27=(148 -364)/27= (-216)/27= -8.\n\nSo a= -8, b=13, then c=76 -49*(-8) -21*(13)=76 +392 -273=76+119=195.\n\nCheck in Equation2:76a +49b +c =76*(-8)+49*13 +195\n\n76*(-8)= -608\n\n49*13=637\n\nThus total: -608+637+195= (29)+195=224. Correct.\n\nSo with a=-8, b=13, c=195, the equations are satisfied.\n\nSo that is a solution with integer coefficients a, b, and c.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence is k_n = -8 k_{n-1} +13 k_{n-2} +195.\n\nTherefore, with this recurrence, the sequence can be extended.\n\nHence, even though without the constant term c there was no solution, with a constant term, there is an integer solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that with a constant term c, there exist integers a, b, c (specifically a=-8, b=13, c=195) that satisfy the recurrence.\n\nHowever, the original question first asks about the recurrence without the constant term. Since that has no integer solutions, but with the constant term there is. The user mentions \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\". So perhaps the problem expects that.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that with the constant term, there exists such a recurrence with integer coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo in the given values. But given the information, adding the constant term allows integer coefficients. \n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, but only with a constant term. Since the user mentioned \"Also try\" that version, perhaps the expected answer is that with the constant term, there is a solution, so the recurrence exists with a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be expecting to present that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a context where the constant term is allowed, so the user is supposed to find that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to know both: no for the linear recurrence, yes for the affine recurrence. \n\nGiven the problem's exact wording: \"Does the sequence follow a recurrence like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\" followed by \"Also try: ... with c\". So the question is two parts, first without c, then with c. \n\nSince the user is asking \"Can you find integer a, b?\" for the first part, the answer is no. For the second part, yes, with a=-8,b=13,c=195. \n\nTherefore, the answer depends on whether the constant term is allowed. Since the problem mentions both, the user might be expecting the second part's answer.\n\nTherefore, the boxed answer would be the coefficients for the recurrence with c. Since the question first asks about the linear recurrence (without c), but since that has no solution, but the second part (with c) does, the answer is that with c=195, a=-8, b=13. Since the question is in Chinese (translated), maybe the problem expects us to find that. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have different numbers, but given the information, this is the solution.\n\nThus, the answer is yes for the recurrence with a constant term, with specific a, b, c. Since the problem mentions trying that, the final answer is that such a recurrence exists with those coefficients. \n\nSo, the boxed answer for the coefficients a, b, c would be a=-8, b=13, c=195. But since the question is \"Can you find integer a, b?\" for the first part (without c), but since that is no, but with c yes, the problem might accept the answer with c. Since the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", likely the coefficients, but since it's three variables, maybe present as a triplet.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is whether such a recurrence exists (with c allowed), then the answer is yes, so boxed \"Yes\", but the problem might want the coefficients. Since the user might expect the coefficients, but in the problem statement, they first present the linear recurrence and then suggest trying with constant. Maybe the answer is that the recurrence with constant term exists, so boxed coefficients:\n\na = -8, b = 13, c = 195. \n\nBut the problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", so maybe the question is whether it exists, so \"Yes\" in a box, but since the user might expect coefficients, or the problem is to find a,b for the linear version which is no. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a miscalculation. Let me check the equations again with a=-8 and b=13 and c=195.\n\nTesting for k7:\n\na\u00d7k6 + b\u00d7k5 +c = (-8)*49 +13*21 +195\n\n-392 + 273 +195 = (-392 + 468)=76. Correct.\n\nFor k8: a\u00d7k7 +b\u00d7k6 +c= (-8)*76 +13*49 +195\n\n-608 + 637 +195= (29)+195=224. Correct.\n\nSo that works. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that with the constant term, there exists such a recurrence with integer coefficients. Since the user mentions \"Also try\" that version, the answer is yes with those coefficients. Since the problem might be in a context where the constant term is allowed, the answer is the triplet (a,b,c)=(-8,13,195). \n\nBut since the question is \"Can you find integer a, b?\" for the first part, but then also suggests trying with c, the final answer is probably the values of a,b,c. Since the user instruction is to put the final answer in boxed, maybe they want the coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be from an Olympiad where the answer is the triplet. So boxed as:\n\n\\boxed{a = -8}, \\boxed{b = 13}, \\boxed{c = 195}\n\nBut since multiple boxed answers are not standard, perhaps as a tuple:\n\n\\boxed{(-8, 13, 195)}\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects just the existence, then \\boxed{Yes} but since they asked for a,b,c, probably the triplet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the minimal such coefficients, but given the way the question is phrased, I'll go with the triplet.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe recurrence relation with integer coefficients is given by \\boxed{a = -8}, \\boxed{b = 13}, and \\boxed{c = 195}.\n\nAlternatively, if combined into a single box for the triplet:\n\n\\boxed{(-8, 13, 195)}\n\nBut since the problem mentions \"a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}\" first, then suggests adding c, perhaps the expected answer is that with c, so the triplet.\n\nConsidering standard answer formats, probably:\n\n\\boxed{-8}, \\boxed{13}, \\boxed{195}\n\nBut instructions say put final answer within a single box. Maybe:\n\n\\boxed{a=-8, b=13, c=195}\n\nBut depending on the problem's expectation. Since the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", perhaps:\n\n\\boxed{a = -8, b = 13, c = 195}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{a = -8, b = 13, c = 195}\n",
