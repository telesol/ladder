  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence, which would mean each term is a linear combination of the two previous terms. The problem gives me two equations based on the 7th and 8th terms, k7 = 76 and k8 = 224, and asks if there exist integers a and b such that k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2}. \n\nFirst, let me write down the equations they provided:\n\nFor k7 = 76:\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = 76a + 49b\n\nHmm, so we have a system of two equations with two variables, a and b. Since they mentioned integer solutions, I should see if there are integers a and b that satisfy both equations. Let me try solving this system step by step.\n\nLet me denote the first equation as equation (1): 49a + 21b = 76\n\nAnd the second equation as equation (2): 76a + 49b = 224\n\nI can use either substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination would work here. Let me see if I can multiply the equations to eliminate one variable.\n\nLet me try multiplying equation (1) by 49 and equation (2) by 21 so that the coefficients of b will be 21*49 and 49*21, which might help in elimination. Wait, actually, let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract equations? Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, let me express one variable in terms of another. Let's solve equation (1) for a:\n\nFrom equation (1):\n49a = 76 - 21b\n=> a = (76 - 21b)/49\n\nHmm, but that gives a in terms of b, but with fractions, which might not lead to integers. Alternatively, maybe solve for b in terms of a?\n\nFrom equation (1):\n21b = 76 - 49a\n=> b = (76 - 49a)/21\n\nHmm, same problem. Maybe plug this into equation (2). Let me try that.\n\nSubstitute b from equation (1) into equation (2):\n\n224 = 76a + 49*( (76 - 49a)/21 )\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 49*( (76 - 49a)/21 )\n\nThat is (49/21)*(76 - 49a) = (7/3)*(76 - 49a)\n\nWait, 49 divided by 21 is 7/3, right? Because 49 is 7*7, 21 is 7*3, so 49/21 = 7/3.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n224 = 76a + (7/3)(76 - 49a)\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n3*224 = 3*76a + 7*(76 -49a)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: 672\n\nRight side:\n\n3*76a = 228a\n\n7*(76) = 532\n\n7*(-49a) = -343a\n\nSo altogether:\n\n228a + 532 - 343a = (228a - 343a) + 532 = (-115a) + 532\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n672 = -115a + 532\n\nNow, subtract 532 from both sides:\n\n672 - 532 = -115a\n\n140 = -115a\n\nSo, a = -140 / 115\n\nHmm, simplifying that fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n-28/23. That's a fraction, so not an integer. Hmm, that's a problem. Since they asked for integer a and b, this suggests that there's no integer solution here? But maybe I made a mistake in calculation?\n\nWait, let me check my steps again because fractions are unexpected here. Let me go through the substitution again carefully.\n\nStarting again with equation (1):\n\n49a +21b =76 --> equation (1)\n\nequation (2):\n\n76a +49b =224 --> equation (2)\n\nLet me try elimination instead. Let's multiply equation (1) by 49 and equation (2) by 21 so that the coefficients of b will be 21*49 and 49*21, but with different signs? Wait, maybe:\n\nAlternatively, to eliminate b:\n\nLet me compute the coefficients:\n\nIn equation (1): coefficient of b is 21\n\nIn equation (2): coefficient of b is 49\n\nSo if I multiply equation (1) by 49 and equation (2) by 21, then the coefficients of b will be 21*49 and 49*21, so same, so subtract to eliminate?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nMultiply equation (1) by 49:\n\n49*(49a +21b) =49*76\n\n=> 49\u00b2 a + 21*49 b = 49*76\n\nMultiply equation (2) by 21:\n\n21*(76a +49b) =21*224\n\n=> 21*76a +21*49b =21*224\n\nNow subtract the first multiplied equation from the second multiplied equation:\n\n[21*76a +21*49b] - [49\u00b2 a +21*49b] =21*224 -49*76\n\nLeft side:\n\n21*76a -49\u00b2 a + (21*49b -21*49b) = 21*76a -49\u00b2 a\n\nThe b terms cancel out. Good.\n\nRight side: 21*224 -49*76\n\nSo compute left side:\n\na*(21*76 -49\u00b2)\n\nCompute 21*76:\n\n21*70 = 1470, 21*6=126, so total 1470+126=1596\n\n49\u00b2 = 49*49. 50\u00b2 is 2500, minus 50 +49 =2500 -99=2401. Wait 49*49=2401?\n\nWait 49*50=2450, minus 49=2401, yes.\n\nSo 21*76 -49\u00b2 =1596 -2401 = -805\n\nSo left side is a*(-805)\n\nRight side: 21*224 -49*76\n\nCompute 21*224: 21*(200+24)=21*200 +21*24=4200 +504=4704\n\n49*76: 50*76 -1*76 = 3800 -76=3724\n\nSo 4704 -3724= 980\n\nTherefore:\n\n-805a =980\n\nThus, a = 980 / (-805) = -980/805\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n-196 / 161. Hmm, 196 is 14\u00b2, 161 is 23*7, so no common factors. So a is -196/161, which is not an integer. So that's again fractional. Hmm.\n\nSo this suggests that there's no integer solution for a and b? But the problem says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" Maybe I did something wrong here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects non-integer a and b? Wait, but the question specifically says \"find integer a, b\". Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in setting up the equations. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: For k7 = 76, the equation is 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n\nWait, but k7 is the 7th term, so k7 = a*k6 + b*k5?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the problem says \"For k7 = 76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\"\n\nBut if the recurrence is k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2}, then to get k7, you need k6 and k5. So if k7 = a*k6 + b*k5, then in the problem, they must have k6 =49 and k5=21?\n\nSimilarly, k8=224 is equal to a*k7 + b*k6 = a*76 + b*49. So that part checks out.\n\nBut where did the values 49 and 21 come from? The problem didn't give the previous terms, but perhaps they are inferred from the recurrence? Wait, maybe the prior terms are given? Wait, the problem only mentions k7 and k8 here, but maybe in the original problem, there's more context? Since the user is just providing the test part here.\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\n\"Does the sequence follow a recurrence like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\n\nTEST: Can we find a, b such that k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\n\nFor k7 = 76:\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n224 = 76a + 49b\n\nSolve system:\nFrom first: 76 = 49a + 21b\nFrom second: 224 = 76a + 49b\n\nCan you find integer a, b?\"\n\nSo according to the user, when setting up the equations for k7 and k8, they plugged in k6=49 and k5=21 for the first equation, and k7=76 and k6=49 for the second equation. So the prior terms k5=21 and k6=49 are given, maybe from previous terms in the sequence.\n\nTherefore, with that in mind, the equations are set up correctly.\n\nTherefore, solving them gives fractional a and b, which would mean there is no integer solution. But the problem is asking to check if such a recurrence exists with integer coefficients. Since the solution is fractional, that suggests that it's not possible with integer a and b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation. Let me check again the elimination approach:\n\nEquation (1): 49a +21b =76\n\nEquation (2):76a +49b =224\n\nLet me try another elimination method. Let me try to make the coefficients of 'a' the same. Let's multiply equation (1) by 76 and equation (2) by 49:\n\nEquation (1)*76: 49*76 a +21*76b =76*76\n\nEquation (2)*49:76*49 a +49\u00b2 b =224*49\n\nNow subtract equation (1)*76 from equation (2)*49:\n\n[76*49a +49\u00b2 b] - [49*76a +21*76b] = 224*49 -76*76\n\nLeft side:\n\n76*49a -49*76a cancels out. \n\nThen, 49\u00b2 b -21*76b = b*(49\u00b2 -21*76)\n\nRight side: 224*49 -76\u00b2\n\nCompute left side:\n\n49\u00b2 is 2401, 21*76 is 1596, so 2401 -1596 = 805. So left side is 805b\n\nRight side:\n\n224*49: 224*50 =11200 minus 224 = 11200 -224= 10976\n\n76\u00b2 is 5776\n\nThus right side: 10976 -5776 =5200\n\nTherefore, 805b =5200\n\nThus, b=5200/805. Let's simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 5200/5=1040; 805/5=161\n\nSo b=1040/161. Hmm, 1040 divided by 161. Let me see if that reduces further. 161 is 23*7, 1040 divided by 7 is 148.57, not integer. So again fractional.\n\nSo both a and b are fractions, which would mean no integer solution.\n\nHmm, so maybe the answer is that there are no integer a and b? But the problem says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So maybe the answer is no?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a mistake in the initial setup? Let me check once again with the equations.\n\nWait, let me check the equations again. For k7 =76, if k6 is 49 and k5 is 21, then the equation is correct. Similarly for k8=224, using k7=76 and k6=49. So equations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows non-integer a and b? The problem says \"Can you find a, b such that...\" but then specifies \"integer a, b\" in the question. Hmm, so maybe the answer is that there is no integer solution. But the problem also mentions \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\". Maybe with a constant term, there could be a solution?\n\nThe user also mentions that if there's a recurrence, they can predict k15, k16. So maybe the first part (without constant) has no solution, but adding a constant term might work?\n\nLet me try that. Let me consider the possibility that the recurrence is linear with a constant term: k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2} + c.\n\nSo now we have three variables a, b, c. To solve this, we would need three equations. Since we have k7 and k8, but maybe we can assume that the recurrence holds starting from some term. Wait, but with only two terms given (k7 and k8), but if we include the constant term, we need three equations. Maybe we need more information?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects that with the constant term, using the existing two equations and maybe an assumption? Hmm, but without additional data points, it's underdetermined. Alternatively, maybe they have prior terms?\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\". Maybe they want us to see if there is a linear recurrence with constant term. Let me see.\n\nLet me suppose that the recurrence is of the form k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2} + c.\n\nThen for k7 =76:\n\n76 = a*k6 + b*k5 +c = a*49 + b*21 +c\n\nSimilarly, for k8=224:\n\n224 = a*k7 + b*k6 +c = a*76 + b*49 +c\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\n1) 49a +21b +c =76\n\n2)76a +49b +c =224\n\nNow, since there are three variables (a,b,c), we need a third equation. Unless we can assume that the recurrence holds for an earlier term? For example, perhaps k6 =49 can be written using the recurrence with k5 and k4?\n\nBut then we would need k4 and k3, which are not provided. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to assume that the constant term c is the same for all terms, so perhaps set up equations for k6 and k5? Wait, but we don't have k5's prior terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can subtract the equations to eliminate c?\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(76a +49b +c) - (49a +21b +c) =224 -76\n\nThis gives:\n\n(76a -49a) + (49b -21b) + (c -c) =148\n\n27a +28b =148\n\nSo 27a +28b =148.\n\nNow, with that equation, we can express one variable in terms of another, but without a third equation, we can't find unique values. However, maybe we can find integer solutions for 27a +28b =148?\n\nLet me see if there are integers a and b that satisfy this equation.\n\nLet me write 27a = 148 -28b\n\nSo 27 divides (148 -28b). Let me see:\n\nWe can write this as 27a \u2261148 mod28. Wait, perhaps trial and error?\n\nLet me rearrange as 28b =148 -27a.\n\nLooking for integer solutions. Let me try possible a values.\n\nLet me see, 27a must be less than or equal to 148, so a <=5.\n\nTrying a=0: 28b =148 \u2192 b=148/28=37/7 not integer.\n\na=1: 28b =148-27=121 \u2192 121/28\u22484.32 not integer.\n\na=2: 28b=148-54=94 \u2192 94/28\u22483.357\u2192 no.\n\na=3:28b=148-81=67\u219267/28\u22482.39\u2192 no.\n\na=4:28b=148-108=40\u219240/28=10/7\u22481.428\u2192 no.\n\na=5:28b=148-135=13\u219213/28\u22480.464\u2192 no.\n\na=6:27*6=162>148\u2192 too big.\n\nNegative a?\n\na= -1: 28b=148+27=175\u2192175/28\u22486.25\u2192 no.\n\na=-2:28b=148+54=202\u2192202/28\u22487.21\u2192 no.\n\nHmm, so maybe there is no integer solution for a and b here either?\n\nAlternatively, maybe fractions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, but maybe c can be a fraction, so even if a and b are fractions, c could also be a fraction. But the problem says \"Can you find a, b\" but didn't specify if they need to be integers. Wait, the original question asked for integer a and b in the first part, but in the second part, it just says \"Also try...\", so maybe c can be a real number?\n\nBut even so, with two equations and three variables, there are infinitely many solutions. So unless there is an additional constraint, it's impossible to determine unique a,b,c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to consider that even with a constant term, the system is underdetermined, so the answer is that there is no such recurrence with constant term unless more terms are known.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the user to consider that the constant term c can be determined if we assume that the recurrence starts at a certain point. Hmm, but without more data, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have a solution with non-integer coefficients, but the question emphasized integer coefficients first, so perhaps the answer is no for the first part, and maybe yes for the second with a constant term, but without more info, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a miscalculation in the previous steps.\n\nWait, let's try solving the two equations with the constant term again:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b +c =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b +c =224\n\nSubtract equation1 from equation2: 27a +28b=148.\n\nSuppose we let\u2019s assign a value to one variable and see if it works.\n\nSuppose a=0:\n\nThen 28b=148 \u2192 b=148/28=37/7\u22485.2857. Then c=76 -49*0 -21*(37/7)=76 - 111= -35. So c=-35. So possible solution a=0, b=37/7, c=-35.\n\nBut a=0, which might be possible, but not sure if that's acceptable. The problem didn't specify that a and b must be integers in the second case.\n\nAlternatively, let me try a=4:\n\nThen 27*4=108, so 28b=148-108=40 \u2192 b=40/28=10/7\u22481.4285. Then c=76 -49*4 -21*(10/7)=76 -196 -30= -150.\n\nAlternatively, a=2:\n\n27*2=54; 28b=148-54=94 \u2192 b=94/28=47/14\u22483.357; c=76 -49*2 -21*(47/14)=76 -98 - (21*47)/14. Wait, maybe this is too messy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let's see if the user might have a typo or miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem had different numbers? Because with the given numbers, the equations don't yield integer solutions for a and b, even with a constant term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is designed such that even though a and b aren't integers, you can still write the recurrence relation with fractions, but the problem specifically asked for integer coefficients first.\n\nGiven the problem's context, the user might be expecting the first part to have no solution (since a and b are fractional), but the second part with a constant term can have a solution. But with two equations and three unknowns, there's an infinite number of solutions. Maybe the problem assumes c is zero, but that reduces back to the first case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in the problem's given values (k7=76, k8=224, k6=49, k5=21). Let me see if those numbers are from a specific sequence.\n\nSuppose the sequence before k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224.\n\nLet me see the differences:\n\nk5=21\n\nk6=49 \u2192 difference +28\n\nk7=76 \u2192 difference +27\n\nk8=224 \u2192 difference +148.\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a quadratic sequence? Let me check the second differences:\n\nFirst differences: 28,27,148\n\nSecond differences: -1, 121\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms follow some pattern with multiplication or exponents?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's numbers are from a different context. Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing the ability to set up the equations correctly, and even though the solution is fractional, the process is what's important. But the question is asking \"Can you find integer a, b?\"\n\nSince the equations lead to fractional a and b, the answer would be no. Then, when considering the constant term, unless more information is given, it's underdetermined. So perhaps the answer is that there is no such linear recurrence with integer coefficients, but there might be one with a constant term, but it can't be uniquely determined with the given information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects to proceed with the fractional coefficients?\n\nIf we take the first case (without constant term), solving the equations:\n\nFrom equation1:49a +21b =76 \u2192 let's divide by 7:7a +3b =76/7 \u224810.857...\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224.\n\nLet me solve the two equations with fractions.\n\nLet me write equation1 as 7a +3b =76/7. Multiply both sides by 7: 49a +21b=76 (original equation).\n\nEquation2 is 76a +49b =224.\n\nLet me use equation1 multiplied by 76 and equation2 multiplied by 49 to eliminate a:\n\nEquation1*76: 49a*76 +21b*76 =76*76 \u2192 3724a +1596b =5776\n\nEquation2*49:76a*49 +49b*49 =224*49 \u2192 3724a +2401b =10976\n\nNow subtract equation1*76 from equation2*49:\n\n(3724a -3724a) + (2401b -1596b)=10976 -5776\n\nSo 805b=5200 \u2192 b=5200/805= 1040/161 \u22486.46\n\nThen plugging back into equation1:49a +21*(1040/161)=76\n\n49a =76 - (21*1040)/161\n\nCalculate 21/161=3/23, so 21*(1040)/161=3*1040/23=3120/23\u2248135.652\n\nSo 49a=76 -3120/23= (76*23 -3120)/23= (1748 -3120)/23= (-1372)/23\n\nThus a= (-1372)/(23*49)= (-1372)/1127= -1.216\n\nSo a\u2248-1.216, b\u22486.46\n\nThese are fractional coefficients. Since the problem asked for integers, there is no solution. So the answer to the first part is no. For the second part, with constant term, even though there are infinitely many solutions, perhaps the problem wants us to note that without more information it's impossible, but maybe a particular solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a typo in the problem's numbers. For instance, if k8 was 224 or another number, the equations might yield integer solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k8 is 148 instead of 224. Let's see:\n\nSuppose k8=148.\n\nThen equation2 becomes76a +49b =148.\n\nThen equation1:49a+21b=76.\n\nLet me try solving these:\n\nMultiply equation1 by 76 and equation2 by 49 again:\n\nBut maybe simpler way:\n\nMultiply equation1 by 7: 343a +147b =532\n\nMultiply equation2 by 3:228a +147b=444\n\nSubtract: (343a -228a)+(147b-147b)=532-444 \u2192115a=88\u2192a=88/115\u22480.765, still not integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe different numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the k5, k6, k7, k8 are from a different context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed to have the student recognize that the system of equations has no integer solutions, hence the answer is that there is no linear recurrence with integer coefficients for the first part, and maybe with a constant term, but it requires more data.\n\nGiven the problem as stated, I think the answer is that there is no solution with integer coefficients for the first part, and the second part requires a constant term but can't be uniquely determined. Since the user might be expecting an answer, I'll proceed with the first part's conclusion.\n\nBut since the user's question is in Chinese and the problem might be translated, perhaps I misinterpreted the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equations can be manipulated differently.\n\nWait, let's try using substitution:\n\nFrom equation1:49a +21b =76.\n\nDivide by 7:7a +3b =76/7. Hmm, not integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the recurrence is of order 1, like k_{n+1}=m*k_n +c.\n\nAssuming a first-order linear recurrence with constant term:\n\nSuppose k_{n+1}= m*k_n +c.\n\nThen:\n\nFor n=5: k6=49=m*k5 +c \u219249=21m +c\n\nFor n=6: k7=76=m*49 +c\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second: 76-49 = m*(49-21) \u219227=28m \u2192m=27/28\u22480.964, then c=49 -21*(27/28)=49 - (567/28)=49 -20.25=28.75.\n\nThen check for n=7: k8 should be m*76 +c= (27/28)*76 +28.75.\n\nCalculate (27/28)*76= (27*76)/28=2052/28\u224873.2857 +28.75\u2248102.0357, but given k8 is 224, so that doesn't match. So that model doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a second-order linear recurrence: k_{n+2}=a*k_{n+1}+b*k_n.\n\nUsing terms k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224.\n\nThen for n=5: k7= a*k6 +b*k5 \u219276=49a +21b\n\nFor n=6:k8= a*k7 +b*k6 \u2192224=76a +49b\n\nNow we have the same equations as before:\n\n49a +21b =76\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nWhich is exactly the same system as the first part of the problem. So solving this system:\n\nLet me write in matrix form:\n\n49a +21b =76\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nLet me compute determinant D=49*49 -21*76=2401 -1596=805\n\nD_a= |76 21; 224 49| =76*49 -21*224=3724 -4704= -980\n\nD_b= |49 76;76 224|=49*224 -76*76=11008 -5776=5232\n\nWait, determinant for a is replacing first column with constants:\n\nD_a:\n\n|76 21|\n\n|224 49| \u219276*49 -21*224= 3724 -4704= -980\n\nSimilarly D_b:\n\n|49 76|\n\n|76 224| \u219249*224 -76*76=11008 -5776=5232\n\nThus,\n\na= D_a/D= -980/805= -196/161\u2248-1.217\n\nb= D_b/D=5232/805\u22486.5\n\nIndeed, the same as before. So fractional coefficients.\n\nTherefore, there is no integer solution for a and b in a second-order linear recurrence.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the first part is no.\n\nSince the user might expect an answer, I think the problem is designed to recognize that there's no integer solution, so the answer is that there is no such recurrence with integer coefficients. If the second part allows constants, but since it's underdetermined, maybe present the general form.\n\nBut the problem's exact wording in Chinese might be slightly different, but given the translation provided, I think the key point is that the first part has no integer solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe system of equations does not have an integer solution, so there is no linear recurrence relation with integer coefficients. \\boxed{\\text{No solution with integer coefficients}}\n",
