Let's see details.\n\nUser message text:\n\n```\nINDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n\nIs there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)?\n\nCalculate f(n) for each key.\n```\n\nWe need to answer if there's a pattern where k_n equals f(n)*n + g(n). The \"index product pattern analysis\" is likely referring to some puzzle or known series. It looks like the user has keys: k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, and k12, with formulas given.\n\nLet's re-read details carefully:\n\n- Observed:\n-- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no) The message says \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" but then there is a note: \"indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no\". So maybe the formula for k5 was given in some context that we do not know. But apparently there's an observation about index 5.\n-- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHypothesis: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nThen Check:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711.\n\nWe need to \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" It seems that the pattern is: For some keys, they are expressed as k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), where apparently sometimes it divides evenly. The data points:\n\n- k7: not working.\n- k8: works: 224/8=28 => so f(8)=? maybe f(8) = 28 and then the remainder g(n)? But check: \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" So they are trying to express it as (f(8)*8+g(8)). They got 224/8=28, which means if you divide k8 by 8, you get 28. So f(8)=? Possibly f(n) equals that quotient sometimes.\n\n- Similarly for k11: 1155/11 = 105 exactly, so f(11)=105 if we assume g(n)=0 in that case maybe.\n- For k12: They computed 2683/12=223.58..., but then also note that k8\u00d712 - 5 equals 2683. So for n=12, the formula might be something like k12 = (k8 * n) - 5. That gives another pattern.\n\nUser message says \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" I assume keys are: k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12 maybe? The provided values are only available for some indices:\nWe know k8=224; k11=1155; k12=2683. And there's also k7=76, k9=467.\nWhat about the others: k2 and k3 are mentioned in first observation: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\". So maybe we have keys for indices 2,3, etc.\n\nUser text: \"OBSERVED: - k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\". That suggests that the intended pattern was to use the digits of index numbers in some formula. But then it says \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\", which is a new pattern.\n\nThe question: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So we need to calculate f(n) from the given keys. Possibly the idea is that sometimes the index appears as a factor in the expression.\n\nGiven data:\nk8: 224; division gives 224/8 = 28.\nk11: 1155; division gives 1155/11=105.\nk12: We have two representations: one attempted linear representation k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) but that didn't yield a nice integer quotient, however if we use formula from observation: k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5. So using that, we can write: k12 = (28\u00d78? Wait recalc: k8=224, so maybe k12 = 224* ? Let's recompute: Actually user says \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" yields 2683. But check: 224 * 12 equals 2688, then subtract 5 gives 2683.\n\nWait a minute, but then k8 was given as \"28\u00d78\", i.e., f(8)=28.\nSo maybe for n=8, f(n) is 28, and for n=11, f(n) is 105. For n=12, the pattern would be: if we try to express it in form f(12)*12 + g(12), then we want to find integer f(12) that fits? Let's see: k12 = 2683, so dividing by 12 gives about 223 remainder something. Precisely, 12*223=2676, remainder 7, so maybe f(12)=223 and then g(12)=7. But wait check: f(n)*n + g(n) should be equal to k_n.\n\nBut then notice that k12 was also expressed as \"k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\". That equals (28\u00d7? no, sorry, recalc: k8=224, so k8*12=2688; 2688-5=2683). So maybe f(12)=? Let's try to express that in the form f(n)*n + g(n): if we let f(n) be consistent with other indices then perhaps f(12) is not equal to what division gives because they are using a different pattern. But the question asks: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So likely we have:\n\nFor index 2,3,5,...? I need to look at given keys:\n- The text says \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" but then later it's expressed as maybe a product formula. But the pattern is unclear.\n\nI think the user is trying to see if there is an underlying pattern that expresses each key as a linear function of its index n: f(n)*n + g(n). They have computed for some keys:\n- For n=7, k7 = 76, then 76/7 \u2248 10.857 so f(7) would be the quotient if it were integer? But apparently not.\n- For n=8, we got an exact division: k8=224 divided by 8 equals 28. So that suggests f(8)=28 (and possibly g(8)=0).\n- For n=9, k9 =467, then 467/9 \u2248 51.888 so not integer.\n- For n=11, k11=1155, division gives exactly 105. So f(11)=105 and maybe g(11)=0 as well.\n- For n=12, if we do division: 2683/12 = 223 remainder 7, so f(12) would be the integer part of that division which is 223 if we assume linear form with integer coefficient? But then k12 becomes 223*12 +7. But does that equal 2683? Let's check: 223*12=2676, plus 7 equals 2683 yes.\n\nSo maybe for those indices where the pattern holds (n=8 and n=11), f(n) is exactly equal to k_n/n, which are 28 and 105 respectively. And also we see a pattern in these numbers: 28 and 105. What relationship? Possibly they are triangular numbers or something?\n28 is the 7th triangular number? Actually 28 is T(7) but wait check: T(n)= n*(n+1)/2, so for n=7 that equals 7*8/2 = 28. Similarly 105 is T(14)? Wait recalc: T(14)=14*15/2=105. So maybe f(11)=105 is not triangular? Let's see: Is there a relation between index and these values? For n=8, T(7)=28; for n=11, T(14)=105. That seems like: for k8, the number 28 comes from triangular number with argument 7 (which is one less than 8)? For k11, the number 105 equals T(14) which is double something? Check: T(n) = n(n+1)/2. If we let n=7 then T(7)=28 and if we let n=14 then T(14)=105. But why would k8 have triangular number of (n-1)? And k11 has triangular number of 2*(n-?) maybe? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(n) is simply the quotient when dividing k_n by n if that division yields an integer. Let's check all keys:\n\nWe see:\nk7 = 76 / 7 \u2248 10.857. So not integer.\nk8 = 224/8 = 28 exactly.\nk9 = 467/9 = 51.888\nk11=1155/11=105 exactly.\nMaybe we have more keys? Possibly also k2, k3 from the product formula? But they are not provided.\n\nThe user says: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So maybe we need to consider all keys given in the text? Which keys do we see?\nk5 is mentioned but its value isn't given explicitly. It's said \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" which implies that if you know k2 and k3, then k5 would be product of them.\nThen k7=76\nk8=224 (and f(8)=28)\nk9=467\nk11=1155 (f(11)=105)\nk12=2683.\n\nNow what is \"f(n)\"? Possibly we can try to express these numbers as some function of n. For n=7: 76 = f(7)*7 + g(7). But if we assume that pattern, then if f(n) is intended to be an integer and maybe minimal such that remainder g(n) is also computed from a recurrence? The fact that k8/8=28 exactly suggests that for some indices f(n)=k_n/n. Similarly, for n=11, 1155/11=105.\n\nMaybe we can guess: f(2)? Possibly it's something like f(2)=3, f(3)=4 maybe because then k5 would equal 3*? That seems too random.\n\nI need to check the pattern \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\" for n=7,8,9,11,12. We have:\nFor n=8: k8=224 gives f(8)=224/8=28 if remainder is 0.\nFor n=11: k11=1155 gives f(11)=1155/11=105.\nFor n=12: if expressed as linear combination with integer coefficient, then f(12) = floor(k12/n)? But then we have remainder g(n). Maybe the pattern might be that for some keys where the division yields an integer, f(n) equals k_n / n exactly. So maybe the answer is: \nFor index 8, f(8)=28.\nFor index 11, f(11)=105.\n\nThen what about others? For k7=76/7 = 10 remainder something: 7*10=70, so then remainder would be 6, so one could write k7=10*7+6, so that gives f(7)=10 and g(7)=6. But the check said it was not clean because division gave 10.86? Wait let's recalc: 76/7 equals 10.857142... Actually 7*10=70, remainder is 6 so quotient is 10 with remainder 6, but then that doesn't sum to 76 if we do integer multiplication, but wait:\n7*11=77, too high, so quotient must be 10 and remainder = 6, because 10*7+? 10*7=70, need additional 6 gives 76. So yes, k7 can be expressed as 10*7 + 6. But the check said \"76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\" but that's approximate fraction. But if we want f(n) to be an integer function possibly then it might not always work.\n\nFor n=9: k9=467; division gives 9*51=459, remainder 8, so one could write 51 * 9 + 8 = 459+8 = 467, which yields f(9)=51 and g(9)=8. But the check said \"467/9 = 51.89\" because that's not an integer division.\n\nFor n=12: k12=2683; division gives 12*223=2676, remainder 7, so it becomes 223*12+7, which gives f(12)=223 and g(12)=7. But then check said \"2683/12 = 223.58\" but that is approximate? Actually let's do exact division: 12*223 = 2676, remainder 7; quotient would be 223 + 7/12 = 223.58333, so yes.\n\nThen what about k5? We don't have its value except it is given by product of k2 and k3 (but we don't know those values). So maybe we need to assume pattern for f(n) when n divides exactly k_n?\n\nThe observation \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" suggests that in this instance, the coefficient multiplying 12 might be related to something like k8/8. Because note: k8=224 and f(8)=28, then k8*12 is 224*12? Let's check: 224*12 = 2688, subtract 5 gives 2683 which equals k12.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that sometimes f(n) equals (k_{n-?} / something)*? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants a function f(n) in terms of n. For instance, for n=7: 10, for n=8:28, for n=9:51, for n=11:105, for n=12:223. The sequence might be: \nf(7)=? Possibly there is a recurrence relation between these numbers. Let's check differences:\nBetween f(8)=28 and f(11)=105 difference is 77 over gap of 3, that's roughly 25.67 increase per index if linear. But then f(12)=223; compared to f(11)=105, the jump is 118 which seems not consistent.\n\nWait: f(n) might be computed as k_n/n if division yields an integer remainder? For n=7: k7=76, so quotient when dividing by 7: 76/7 = 10 R6. But then maybe they want f(7)=floor(76/7)? That gives 10.\nFor n=8: floor(224/8)=28 (exact).\nFor n=9: floor(467/9) = 51 remainder 8 because 9*52 would be 468 which is too high, so yes 51.\nFor n=11: floor(1155/11)=105 exactly.\nFor n=12: floor(2683/12)=223 remainder 7.\n\nSo one pattern could be f(n) = floor(k_n / n). But then what's the significance of g(n)? Possibly they want to see if k_n/n is always an integer for some indices (like perfect squares, triangular numbers etc.). The text \"not clean\" might mean that the division doesn't yield an integer quotient.\n\nMaybe the intended answer: For keys where k_n can be expressed exactly as f(n) * n (with g(n)=0), we have:\n- For n=8, f(8)=28 because 224/8 = 28.\n- For n=11, f(11)=105 because 1155/11 = 105.\n\nFor keys where the division isn't exact:\n- For n=7: k7=76 = 10*7 + 6, so if we define f(7) as the quotient when dividing by n, then f(7)=10 and remainder g(7)=6.\n- For n=9: k9=467 = 51*9 + 8, so f(9)=51, g(9)=8.\n- For n=12: k12=2683 = 223*12 + 7, so f(12)=223 and remainder g(12)=7.\n\nSo maybe the answer is: \nf(n) = \u230ak_n / n\u230b if you want an integer part function. But then is that pattern interesting? Possibly not.\n\nMaybe there's a hidden recurrence relation among k_n values that gives f(n)? Perhaps we can compute differences:\nFor n=7, f(7)=10.\nn=8: 28, difference of 18 from 10 (if sequential).\nn=9: 51, difference from previous is 23.\nn=11: 105, but n jumps to 11 skipping 10? The sequence might be only for primes or something.\n\nMaybe we assume the keys are indexed by prime numbers. We see n=7, 11, and maybe also 5 if that's a key. Then f(5) would then be? But k5 is given as product of k2 and k3, but not numeric.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another pattern: The ones with clean division are indices 8 and 11; and those numbers (28 and 105) have combinatorial significance: 28 = C(8,2)? Actually, 28 equals the sum of first 7 integers or binomial coefficient. And 105 equals C(14,4)? Not sure.\n\nLet me re-read the question as given:\n\n\"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly it's from a previous context: maybe we have keys like k_n defined by some recurrence and we want to see if they can be expressed in closed form. The provided text: \n\"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" might indicate that keys are generated with multiplication sometimes, and addition sometimes? And then there is the pattern \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\". That looks like a recurrence relation: maybe k_n = (some earlier key) * n - something.\n\nMaybe we can try to deduce f(n) for each key from given relationships:\nWe have keys: 2,3,? then 5,7,8,9,11,12. But not all values are provided.\nWe know: k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3.\nk7 = 76 (provided).\nk8 = 224 (provided) so f(8)=28 if we write it as 28\u00d78.\nk9 = 467\nk11=1155, which is 105\u00d711 exactly.\nk12 = k8\u00d712 - 5 = 2683.\n\nNow let's try to see if there's a pattern: maybe f(n) = something like (n-1 choose something)? For n=8, f(8)=28 equals C(8,2)? Actually C(8,2)=28 indeed. For n=11, f(11)=105 equals C(15,2)/? Let me check: C(15,2) = 105. So maybe for n=11, f(11)=C(15,2). And then for n=7, if we try to fit that pattern, maybe f(7)=C(???) But C(6,2)=15 which is not 10; C(8,2)=28, too high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(n) = (n-1)^3? For n=8, that would be 7^3=343, no.\n\nOr maybe f(n) equals the number of combinations of something. 105 for 11 and 28 for 8 are triangular numbers: 28 is T(7)=7*8/2; 105 is T(14)=14*15/2. So maybe there's a relation between n and these numbers. For n=8, T(7) = (n-1)*n/2. For n=11, T(14)=? But that doesn't match: if we set m = n+6 then T(n+6) for n=11 gives T(17)=153 which is not 105.\n\nMaybe f(n) equals the sum of some function from previous keys. \nMaybe k_n are defined by a recurrence relation that involves multiplication and addition with the index. The pattern \"k8=224\" and then \"k12 = k8\u00d712 -5\" might suggest that sometimes the coefficient is determined by an earlier key divided by its index, i.e., f(8)=28 and then multiplied by 12 gives 336, but then subtracting 5 gives 331 which doesn't match 2683 though. Let's check: if we had k8=224, then f(8)=224/8 =28. Then maybe for n=12, f(12) could be computed as (f(8)+?)*n or something.\n\nWait, k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 -5 = 2683 implies that k8\u00d712 is 2688. And 2688 divided by 12 gives 224 exactly. So it fits the pattern if we consider f(n)=k_n/n then for n=12, f(12) would be 2683/12 which is not an integer but can be expressed as (k8 + something)? Not sure.\n\nLet me try to parse: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly the answer expects:\n\nFor key 7: f(7)=10, g(7)=6.\nFor key 8: f(8)=28, g(8)=0.\nFor key 9: f(9)=51, g(9)=8.\nFor key 11: f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\nFor key 12: f(12)=223, g(12)=7.\n\nThat is a possibility if we define f(n) as the quotient and g(n) as the remainder in writing k_n = f(n)*n + g(n).\n\nBut then what about key 5? We don't have its value. Possibly we assume it's also of that form: maybe k5 is something like 10*5+? But not given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intended answer is to see if there is a closed-form expression for f(n) in terms of n. Observing:\nFor n=8, f(8)=28 = 4^2 + ? Not sure.\nFor n=11, f(11)=105 which is 7*15? No.\n\nMaybe I can try to solve for f(n) using the relation k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 -5. Write k12 in terms of f: k12 = 12*f(12)+g(12) and k8 = 8*f(8)+ g(8). But we know from above that f(8)=28 exactly (with remainder 0), so k8=224, then k12 = 12*223 +7? That doesn't match because 12*223 is 2676 plus 7 equals 2683. And also note 2688-5=2683.\n\nMaybe the answer expects: \"It appears that for some keys, f(n) turns out to be an integer (namely for n=8 and n=11), while for others it does not (for n=7,9,12). In those cases, we can write k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) where f(n)=\u230ak_n/n\u230b. Thus, for the given keys: \nf(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and f(12)=223.\"\n\nBut is that all? Possibly yes.\n\nMaybe I'll state:\n\n- For n=7: 76 = 10\u00d77 + 6, so f(7)=10.\n- For n=8: 224 = 28\u00d78, so f(8)=28.\n- For n=9: 467 = 51\u00d79 + 8, so f(9)=51.\n- For n=11: 1155 = 105\u00d711, so f(11)=105.\n- For n=12: 2683 = 223\u00d712 + 7, so f(12)=223.\n\nI can also mention that these values may have combinatorial significance. For instance, 28 is the number of diagonals in an octagon or a combinatorial number, and 105 is C(15,2) or something similar.\n\nBut let me check: 105 = C(15,2)? Actually, C(15,2)=105 indeed, and 28 = C(8,2)=28. So maybe f(n) for these keys are given by binomial coefficients: f(8)=C(8,2) and f(11)=C(15,2). But then why would f(7)=10? That doesn't match any obvious binomial coefficient from 7. C(5,2)=10 though! Yes, C(5,2)=10. And for n=9: 51 is not a standard binomial coefficient from 9, but 51 = C(? ) maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(n) are given by a quadratic formula. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in the ones that come out exact (n=8 and n=11). They satisfy: \nFor n=8, f(8)=28.\nFor n=11, f(11)=105.\nMaybe the rule is f(n)=? Possibly f(n) = (n-1)(n+?)... For 8: (7*?=28 gives 4, but then for 11: (10*?=105, then ?=10.5, no).\n\nWait, maybe it's a coincidence that these two are binomial coefficients from some other numbers:\n28 = C(8,2)\n105 = C(15,2)\n\nMaybe there is a relation f(n) = (n^2 -3n + 2)/? For n=8: (64-24+2)=42/?, not 28.\nFor n=11: (121-33+2)=90, no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are part of a recursive definition where sometimes multiplication and addition come in. The text \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" suggests that sometimes the key is defined by multiplying two previous keys.\n\nI suspect that without additional context it's ambiguous what f(n) is exactly supposed to be computed as.\n\nMaybe I'll answer: \n\nWe can express each key as k_n = n * f(n) + g(n), where 0 \u2264 g(n) < n. For the given keys, we have:\n\nFor key 7: 76 = 7\u00d710 + 6, so f(7)=10.\nFor key 8: 224 = 8\u00d728 + 0, so f(8)=28.\nFor key 9: 467 = 9\u00d751 + 8, so f(9)=51.\nFor key 11: 1155 = 11\u00d7105 + 0, so f(11)=105.\nFor key 12: 2683 = 12\u00d7223 + 7, so f(12)=223.\n\nThus the answer is: \nf(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and f(12)=223.\n\nI can also mention that these values seem to sometimes be exact multiples of n (for keys 8, 11) while in other cases there is a remainder. The pattern might hint at underlying combinatorial structures.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer expected: \"f(n)=\u230ak_n/n\u230b\" and then plugging in the values for k_n provided. That seems plausible.\n\nI will now produce an answer with a clear explanation:\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe are given keys k_7=76, k_8=224, k_9=467, k_11=1155, and k_12=2683 (with k_5 defined in terms of k_2 and k_3, but its value is not needed here). We wish to write each key as:\nk_n = n * f(n) + g(n), with 0 \u2264 g(n) < n.\nFor n=7: 76 divided by 7 gives quotient 10 remainder 6, so f(7)=10.\nFor n=8: 224 \u00f7 8 = 28 exactly, so f(8)=28.\nFor n=9: 467 \u00f7 9 gives quotient 51 remainder 8 (since 9*51=459, and 467-459=8), so f(9)=51.\nFor n=11: 1155 \u00f7 11 = 105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\nFor n=12: 2683 \u00f7 12 gives quotient 223 remainder 7 (since 12*223=2676 and 2683-2676=7), so f(12)=223.\n\nThus the answer is:\nf(7) = 10, f(8) = 28, f(9) = 51, f(11) = 105, and f(12) = 223.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in plain text.</think>We can write each key k\u2099 in the form\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = n \u00b7 f(n) + g(n)\u2003\u2003with\u20030 \u2264 g(n) < n.\n\nIn other words, f(n) is just the quotient when k\u2099 is divided by n. (Sometimes this division is exact and sometimes there is a nonzero remainder.)\n\nFor example, suppose we are given\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2087 = 76,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2088 = 224,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2089 = 467,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 1155, and\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 2683.\n\nThen we compute f(n) for each key as follows:\n\n1. For n = 7:\n\u2003Divide 76 by 7.\n\u2003\u20037 \u00d7 10 = 70\u2003and\u200376 \u2013 70 = 6.\n\u2003Thus, 76 = 7\u00b710 + 6 so that f(7) = 10.\n\n2. For n = 8:\n\u2003Divide 224 by 8.\n\u2003\u20038 \u00d7 28 = 224 exactly (remainder 0).\n\u2003So, f(8) = 28.\n\n3. For n = 9:\n\u2003Divide 467 by 9.\n\u2003\u20039 \u00d7 51 = 459\u2003and\u2003467 \u2013 459 = 8.\n\u2003Thus, 467 = 9\u00b751 + 8 so that f(9) = 51.\n\n4. For n = 11:\n\u2003Divide 1155 by 11.\n\u2003\u200311 \u00d7 105 = 1155 exactly.\n\u2003So, f(11) = 105.\n\n5. For n = 12:\n\u2003Divide 2683 by 12.\n\u2003\u200312 \u00d7 223 = 2676\u2003and\u20032683 \u2013 2676 = 7.\n\u2003Thus, 2683 = 12\u00b7223 + 7 so that f(12) = 223.\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\n\u2003f(7) = 10,\n\u2003f(8) = 28,\n\u2003f(9) = 51,\n\u2003f(11) = 105, and\n\u2003f(12) = 223.",
