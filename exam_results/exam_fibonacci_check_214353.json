  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence, which is like k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2}. The user has given me two equations based on k7 = 76 and k8 = 224. They also mentioned trying a recurrence with a constant term, like k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2} + c. Hmm, so I need to check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let me focus on the linear recurrence without the constant term. The equations given are:\n\nFor k7 = 76:\n76 = 49a + 21b  ...(1)\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = 76a + 49b  ...(2)\n\nI need to solve these two equations for a and b. Let me write them down again:\n\nEquation (1): 49a + 21b = 76  \nEquation (2): 76a + 49b = 224\n\nHmm, solving a system of equations. Since there are two variables, I can use substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination. Maybe multiply the first equation by something so that the coefficients of a or b can be eliminated.\n\nLet me see, if I multiply equation (1) by 76 and equation (2) by 49, then the coefficients of a would be 49*76 and 76*49, which would be the same. Wait, that might not help. Alternatively, maybe make the coefficients of b the same?\n\nLooking at the coefficients of b in equation (1) is 21, in equation (2) is 49. The LCM of 21 and 49 is 147. So, let me try scaling equation (1) by 7 and equation (2) by 3, so that the coefficients of b become 147 and 147?\n\nWait, 21*7 = 147, and 49*3 = 147. Let me see:\n\nMultiply equation (1) by 7:  \n49a*7 + 21b*7 = 76*7  \n=> 343a + 147b = 532 ...(3)\n\nMultiply equation (2) by 3:  \n76a*3 + 49b*3 = 224*3  \n=> 228a + 147b = 672 ...(4)\n\nNow subtract equation (4) from equation (3):\n\n(343a + 147b) - (228a + 147b) = 532 - 672  \n343a - 228a = -140  \n115a = -140  \nHmm, a = -140 / 115. Let me simplify that. Divide numerator and denominator by 5:  \n-28/23. So a is -28/23? That's a fraction. The problem mentioned trying to find integer a and b. Hmm, so that might not be acceptable. \n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake in the signs? Let me check:\n\nWait in equation (3) - equation (4):\n\n343a - 228a = 115a  \n147b - 147b = 0  \nRight-hand side is 532 - 672 = -140. So 115a = -140, so yes, a = -140/115. That simplifies to -28/23. Not an integer. So maybe there are no integer solutions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I did the multiplication wrong? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\nEquation (1): 49a +21b =76  \nEquation (2):76a +49b =224\n\nMultiply equation (1) by 7: 49*7=343, 21*7=147, 76*7=532.  \nMultiply equation (2) by 3: 76*3=228, 49*3=147, 224*3=672.  \nSubtracting gives 115a = -140. So that seems correct. So a is -28/23, which is not an integer. Hmm, so maybe there are no integer solutions for a and b?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try substitution instead. Let me try solving equation (1) for a or b.\n\nLet me solve equation (1) for a:\n\n49a = 76 - 21b  \na = (76 -21b)/49\n\nThen plug into equation (2):\n\n76*( (76 -21b)/49 ) + 49b =224\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, 76*(76 -21b)/49 +49b =224\n\nMultiply through by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49b*49 =224*49\n\nCompute each term:\n\n76*76 = 5776  \n76*(-21b) = -1596b  \n49b*49 = 2401b  \n224*49: Let's see, 224*50=11200, minus 224 gives 11200-224=10976\n\nSo putting together:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b = 10976  \nCombine like terms:\n\n5776 + (2401b -1596b) = 10976  \n2401 -1596 = 805. So 805b\n\nThus:  \n5776 +805b =10976  \nSubtract 5776:  \n805b =10976 -5776  \nCompute 10976-5776: 5200? Wait, 10976 -5000=5976, then subtract 776 more: 5976-776=5200. Yes.\n\nThus, 805b =5200  \nSo b =5200/805\n\nSimplify this fraction. Let's see, 5200 divided by 805.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:  \n5200/5=1040; 805/5=161  \nSo 1040/161. Hmm, 161 divides into 1040 how many times? 161*6=966, 1040-966=74. So 6 and 74/161. Not an integer. So b is not an integer either. \n\nTherefore, there are no integer solutions for a and b in this case. Hmm, so maybe the recurrence isn't of the form k_n = a*k_{n-1} +b*k_{n-2} with integer coefficients? \n\nAlternatively, maybe fractions are allowed? The user said \"Can you find integer a, b?\" so probably looking for integers. Since we can't find integers, so maybe the answer is no for that. \n\nBut let me check my calculations again, because maybe I made an error. Let me recalculate the substitution step.\n\nStarting from equation (1): 49a +21b =76  \nEquation (2):76a +49b =224\n\nExpress a from equation (1):  \na=(76 -21b)/49\n\nPlug into equation (2):\n\n76*(76 -21b)/49 +49b =224  \nMultiply all terms by 49:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49b*49 =224*49  \nCompute each term:\n\n76^2 =5776  \n76*(-21b)= -1596b  \n49b*49 =2401b  \n224*49=10976\n\nSo total equation:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b =10976  \nSo 5776 + (2401b -1596b)=10976  \n2401-1596=805, so 805b +5776=10976  \nThus 805b=10976-5776=5200. So b=5200/805. \n\nYes, same result. Let me see 5200 divided by 805. Let me see if both divide by 5: yes, 5200/5=1040, 805/5=161. 1040 divided by 161. Let me check if 161 divides into 1040. 161*6=966. 1040-966=74. So 74/161, so not an integer.\n\nHmm, so that seems correct. Therefore, there are no integer solutions for a and b. So the answer is no for the first part.\n\nNow, the user also mentioned trying a recurrence with a constant term: k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2} + c. Let me try that. So we need to find a, b, c such that:\n\nFor k7 =76:  \n76 =a*k6 +b*k5 +c  \nWait, but actually, the user mentioned k7=76 and k8=224. Wait, but in order to set up equations for this with a constant term, we might need another term. Let me see the indices here.\n\nWait, the user only provided k7 and k8, but for a recurrence of order 2 with a constant term, we would need three equations. Since we have two terms here, maybe the user is assuming previous terms? Wait, the user says \"For k7 =76\" and \"For k8 =224\", so maybe the previous terms are known?\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"k7=76\" and \"k8=224\", so likely the terms before that, like k6 and k5 are known. Wait, in the first equations, they used k_{n-1}=49 for k7, implying that k6 was 49, and k5 was 21? Let me check the original problem's setup.\n\nLooking back: The user wrote:\n\n\"For k7 = 76:\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n224 = 76a + 49b\"\n\nAh, so here they are assuming that k6 is 49, and k5 is 21. Because when calculating k7 = a*k6 + b*k5, so k6 =49, k5=21.\n\nSimilarly for k8 = a*k7 + b*k6, so k7 is 76, k6 is 49. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the sequence up to k6 is known. But when considering the recurrence with a constant term, we need to have an equation for k7, k8, and maybe another term to set up three equations for a, b, c. \n\nWait, but we only have two terms here (k7 and k8), so maybe we need to assume that the previous terms follow the same recurrence? Or perhaps the user is expecting to use the same terms but with three variables?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to set up equations with the constant term using the existing terms.\n\nLet me try. Let's suppose the recurrence is k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2} + c.\n\nThen for k7:\n\n76 = a*k6 + b*k5 +c  \nWhich is 76 = a*49 + b*21 +c ...(5)\n\nFor k8:\n\n224 = a*k7 + b*k6 +c  \nWhich is 224 = a*76 + b*49 +c ...(6)\n\nSo now we have two equations with three variables a,b,c. So we need a third equation. Maybe using an earlier term?\n\nWait, maybe we have to assume that the recurrence started earlier? If we have, say, k6 and k5, perhaps the recurrence also holds for them? Let me see:\n\nSuppose the recurrence holds for k6 and k5 as well, then:\n\nk6 = a*k5 +b*k4 +c  \nBut we don't know k4. Hmm, this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects us to use another term. Wait, but the original problem only gives k7 and k8, so maybe they expect to assume that the recurrence can be determined with two equations and a third condition? Or maybe that c is a constant, so we can subtract the equations to eliminate c?\n\nYes, that's a good idea. Let me subtract equation (5) from equation (6):\n\nEquation (6) minus equation (5):\n\n224 -76 = (76a +49b +c) - (49a +21b +c)  \n148 = (76a -49a) + (49b -21b) + (c -c)  \n148 = 27a +28b\n\nSo we get 27a +28b =148 ...(7)\n\nBut we also have equation (5): 49a +21b +c =76  \nEquation (6):76a +49b +c=224\n\nSo if we can solve equations (5) and (6) with (7), but since (7) is derived from them, we can use (7) and one of the others. Let me see.\n\nLet me use equation (7):27a +28b =148  \nAnd perhaps use equation (5):49a +21b +c =76  \nWe can solve for c: c =76 -49a -21b  \nSimilarly, once a and b are found, c is determined.\n\nBut we need another equation. Wait, unless there's an assumption that the constant term is the same for all n, so we need to have at least three equations. But with only k7 and k8, we can't get three equations. Hmm, so perhaps the user expects that even with two equations, maybe we can find integer a, b, c?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows fractions? Let me see.\n\nWait, let me try solving for a and b using equation (7):27a +28b =148  \nWe can solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nLet me solve for a:\n\n27a =148 -28b  \na = (148 -28b)/27\n\nWe need a and b to be integers? Let's see. So 148 -28b must be divisible by 27.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n148 \u226128b mod27  \nBecause 27a \u2261 (148 -28b) mod27  \nBut since 27a mod27 is 0, so 148 -28b \u22610 mod27  \nThus, 28b \u2261148 mod27\n\nCompute 28 mod27 is 1, and 148 mod27: 27*5=135, so 148-135=13. So:\n\n1*b \u226113 mod27  \nThus, b\u226113 mod27. So possible solutions for b are integers of the form 27k +13, where k is an integer.\n\nSo let me let b=13 +27k. Then, plugging into a=(148-28b)/27:\n\na=(148 -28*(13 +27k))/27  \n= (148 -364 -756k)/27  \n= (-216 -756k)/27  \n= -216/27 -756k/27  \n= -8 -28k\n\nThus, a = -8 -28k and b=13 +27k.\n\nSo possible integer solutions are parametrized by integer k:\n\na = -8 -28k  \nb =13 +27k  \nc can be computed from equation (5):\n\nc=76 -49a -21b  \nPlugging in a and b:\n\nc =76 -49*(-8 -28k) -21*(13 +27k)  \n=76 +392 +1372k -273 -567k  \n= (76 +392 -273) + (1372k -567k)  \n= (195) + (805k)\n\nThus, c =195 +805k.\n\nTherefore, for any integer k, we can have a solution. But unless there's a constraint on c, there are infinitely many solutions. However, the problem might be expecting the minimal constants or some specific ones?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows for any integer solutions, so the answer is that there is a solution with constants, but infinitely many. But the user might be expecting to see if there exists such integers a,b,c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying small k values to see if we can get small integers.\n\nLet me try k=0:\n\nThen:\n\na= -8  \nb=13  \nc=195\n\nCheck equation (5):49*(-8)+21*(13)+195  \n= -392 +273 +195  \n= (-392 +273)= -119; -119 +195=76. Correct for equation (5).  \nEquation (6):76*(-8) +49*(13)+195  \n= -608 +637 +195  \n= ( -608 +637)=29; 29+195=224. Correct.\n\nSo that works. So with k=0, we have a solution a=-8, b=13, c=195. Thus, there is a solution with constants.\n\nAlternatively, with k= -1:\n\na= -8 -28*(-1)=20  \nb=13 +27*(-1)= -14  \nc=195 +805*(-1)= -610\n\nCheck equation (5):49*20 +21*(-14)+ (-610)  \n=980 -294 -610  \n= (980-294)=686; 686 -610=76. Correct.  \nEquation (6):76*20 +49*(-14)+(-610)  \n=1520 -686 -610  \n= (1520-686)=834; 834-610=224. Correct.\n\nAlso works. So there are infinitely many solutions. But the user might just need to know that such a recurrence exists with constants, so the answer is yes, there is a recurrence with constants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to know if there is a non-constant term, so with c\u22600. Since we found solutions where c is non-zero, then yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is whether such a recurrence exists with constants, and the answer is yes. \n\nTherefore, summarizing:\n\nThe original question (first part) asks whether the recurrence without constant term (just a and b) can be integers, and the answer is no. \n\nThe second part (with constant term) can have solutions with integers a,b,c (for example, a=-8, b=13, c=195). \n\nTherefore, the answer to the first part is no, and the second part is yes. But since the user's question is presented as two parts, but in the problem statement it's written as \"F: Please...\" so maybe they want the answers for both parts in the box.\n\nWait, looking back at the original problem:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"F: Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nBut the problem presented is: first part is whether the recurrence without constant has integers a,b, which has no solution. The second part is to try with constant. So perhaps the user wants the answer to the second part? Or both?\n\nWait, actually, the problem is written as:\n\n\"Please ... put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nBut the initial problem statement is unclear. Wait, looking again at the user's message:\n\nThe user starts with:\n\n\"F: Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nThen the actual problem is presented in the following lines:\n\n\"F: Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nF: Please...\"\n\nWait, actually, perhaps the user is presenting a problem where they want to know whether the sequence defined by the terms up to k7 and k8 can be expressed with a linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients, either with or without a constant term. The problem is in Chinese, maybe?\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe initial user message is in English, except for \"F: Please...\" which is the instruction. The problem seems to be that the user is asking about a recurrence relation for a sequence where k7=76, k8=224, with previous terms k6=49, k5=21, etc., and they want to know if there exists a linear recurrence (with or without constant) that fits.\n\nThe user's question is divided into two parts: first without constant term, second with constant term. Since the user wants the final answer boxed, perhaps they expect two boxed answers? Or perhaps the problem is to determine which one is possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the constants for the recurrence with constant term, but given that the user's question is a bit unclear, but given the initial equations, the answer would be that without constants, no solution, but with constants yes. So the final answer is that with constants it's possible, so the existence is yes. But the user might need to write the constants?\n\nAlternatively, since in the first part the equations have no solution, but adding a constant allows solutions, so the answer is that a linear recurrence with constant term exists, so the answer is \\boxed{yes} or provide the constants?\n\nWait, the original problem might have been in Chinese, but the user might have translated it. Alternatively, given the initial setup, the problem might be to find the values of a and b for the recurrence without constant, which is impossible, so the answer is no. But if considering with constant, then possible. Since the user mentions \"Please put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", maybe the problem is asking for the values of a and b in the non-constant case, which don't exist, so the answer is no, boxed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from an exam where the question is to determine the recurrence relation coefficients, and the correct answer is that it's impossible without a constant, but possible with, so the user might need to answer with the constants a,b,c? For example, a=-8, b=13, c=195, but written boxed? Since the question is a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original problem is in Chinese, and the user is translating, but the key point is that when they set up the equations for the non-constant recurrence, there are no integer solutions, but with a constant term, there are, so the answer is that the recurrence requires a constant term, so the boxed answer is the coefficients a, b, c? For example, the minimal solution a=-8, b=13, c=195, but in boxed form?\n\nAlternatively, since the user might have a different intention, but given the information, the best possible answer is that without a constant term, there are no integer solutions, but with a constant term, there are, so the answer to the problem is that a linear recurrence with constant term exists, so the answer is yes, boxed as \\boxed{Yes}? Or the coefficients?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the value of a + b + c or something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, given the user mentions \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", maybe the problem is to find the value of a + b when considering the constant term? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be to find the next term in the sequence using the recurrence with constant term, but since the user hasn't asked that.\n\nAlternatively, given the initial equations, perhaps the problem is simply to solve for a and b in the first case (without constant), which is impossible, so the answer is that there are no integers a and b, so the answer is \\boxed{\\text{No solution}}.\n\nBut in math problems like this, sometimes the question is to find a and b even if they are fractions. Let me check that possibility.\n\nIf we ignore the integer requirement, then for the first part:\n\nWe have equations:\n\n49a +21b =76  \n76a +49b =224  \n\nLet me write this as a system:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b =76  \nEquation2:76a +49b =224  \n\nLet me solve this system.\n\nMultiply equation1 by 49 and equation2 by21 to eliminate b:\n\nEquation1*49: 49*49a +21*49b =76*49  \nEquation2*21:76*21a +49*21b =224*21  \n\nSubtract equation2*21 from equation1*49:\n\n[49\u00b2a -76*21a] + [21*49b -49*21b] =76*49 -224*21  \nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term for a:\n\n49\u00b2a - (76*21)a = a*(49\u00b2 -76*21)\n\nCompute 49\u00b2=2401, 76*21=1596  \nThus, 2401-1596=805  \nSo 805a\n\nSecond term for b:\n\n21*49b -49*21b =0\n\nRight side:\n\n76*49 -224*21  \n76*49=3724  \n224*21=4704  \n3724-4704= -980\n\nThus:\n\n805a = -980  \na = -980 /805 = simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 35:  \n-980/35= -28; 805/35=23  \nSo a= -28/23\n\nThen plug back into equation1:\n\n49*(-28/23) +21b =76  \nCompute 49*(-28)/23 = (-1372)/23  \nThus,\n\n21b =76 +1372/23 = (76*23 +1372)/23  \n76*23=1748  \n1748 +1372= 3120  \nThus,\n\n21b=3120/23 \u2192 b= (3120)/(23*21)= 3120/483  \nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 3: 1040/161\n\nSo b=1040/161 \u22486.46...\n\nThus, the solution in fractions is a=-28/23 and b=1040/161, but they are not integers. Hence, there are no integer solutions for a and b. Therefore, the answer for the first part is no.\n\nIf the problem is asking whether integers a and b exist, then the answer is no. Since the user mentioned \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", likely expects \\boxed{-8} or some number, but given the context, the problem might be in Chinese and the actual question is to find a and b assuming a constant term is allowed. Since with constant term there are solutions, and the simplest integer solution is a=-8, b=13, c=195. If the problem asks for a+b+c, then -8+13+195= 200, but without knowing the exact question, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, the problem might be to find the next term in the sequence using the recurrence, but since the user didn't ask that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is asking whether the sequence can be described by a linear recurrence relation of order 1 with constant coefficients. The answer is no, but with a constant term it can. So the answer is that it requires a constant term, so the boxed answer would be the coefficients. But since the user might have different requirements, given the initial problem setup, the most probable is that the first part has no solution (so answer is no), and the second part has (yes), but since the user instruction is to put the final answer in a box, maybe the second part's coefficients?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be asking for the value of a + b in the recurrence with constant term. For the solution a=-8, b=13: a+b=5, but also c=195. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from an Olympiad where the answer is the next term, which would be k9 = a*k8 + b*k7 + c. With a=-8, b=13, c=195:\n\nk9 = -8*224 +13*76 +195  \n= -1792 + 988 +195  \n= (-1792 +988)= -804; -804+195= -609\n\nBut that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the linear recurrence relation of order 1 with constant term, so the answer is a=-8, b=13, c=195, so boxed as \\boxed{-8}, \\boxed{13}, \\boxed{195}. But the user might need only the coefficients a and b, but since it requires c, perhaps the answer is that it requires a constant term, so the answer is the triplet.\n\nAlternatively, given the ambiguity, but based on standard problems, the question is likely asking for the coefficients a and b without a constant term, which have no integer solutions, so the answer is no. Hence, boxed no.\n\nBut in mathematical terms, since the user might expect numerical answers, and given that the problem might have been to find a and b assuming they are integers, so the answer is that there are no integers a and b satisfying the equations, so the answer is \\boxed{\\text{No solution}}.\n\nAlternatively, in some contexts, the problem might accept fractions, then a=-28/23 and b=1040/161, but boxed as fractions.\n\nAlternatively, since the user mentioned \"Please put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", maybe the problem is to solve for a and b (fractions), so the answer is a=-28/23 and b=1040/161, but boxed how? Maybe as two boxed answers.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be in the style of the AIME where the answer is an integer, so perhaps the constant term's coefficients a, b, c summed? For example, a + b + c = -8+13+195=200, so \\boxed{200}. Or the next term is -609, boxed as \\boxed{-609}. But without clear question, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, given the initial problem setup, if I consider the user is asking if a linear recurrence without constant exists (answer: no), then the answer is \"No\", which in boxed is \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n\nHowever, in many math problems, especially Olympiad, they might expect to write \"No solution\" in the box, but in standard format, maybe just \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n\nAlternatively, if the original problem is in Chinese, perhaps the question is to find the coefficients with constant term, and the answer is a=-8, b=13, c=195, which could be written as \\boxed{a=-8, b=13, c=195}, but in a single box.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have had a different condition, but given the information, I think the most reasonable answer is that without a constant term, there are no integer solutions, so the answer is \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-8}, \\boxed{13}, \\boxed{195}\n\nHowever, considering the problem might require just the existence, the correct answer is there exists a solution with a constant term, so the answer is yes, but given the possible options, the coefficients are boxed as above. Alternatively, the problem might require the next term, but without more info, I'll go with the coefficients for the constant term recurrence.\n\nWait, but the user didn't specify, so maybe the problem is to solve for a and b in the first case (no constant), which is impossible, so the answer is no. Since the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", maybe just \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n\nBut given the detailed calculations above, the correct boxed answer for the existence with constants is yes, but since the user might have intended the coefficients, but given ambiguity, the most precise answer based on the first part's impossibility is \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n\nBut the initial equations have no integer solutions for a and b. So the final answer is \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different setup. Given the user's initial equations:\n\nk7=76, k8=224, and the recurrence is linear of order 1, so k_{n} = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2} ?\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I misread the order.\n\nWait, in the equations given by the user:\n\nThe user set up equations for a recurrence relation of the form k_n = a k_{n-1} + b, but that might not be.\n\nWait, actually, in the problem as presented by the user, the equations are:\n\nFor the first part (without constant term):\n\n49a +21b =76 (from k7 = a k6 + b k5 ? )\n\nWait, no. Wait, the equations are formed based on previous terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the recurrence is of order 1: k_n = a k_{n-1} + b.\n\nThus, for n=7: k7 = a k6 + b \u2192 76 =49a +b  \nFor n=8:224=76a +b\n\nThen solving:\n\n76 =49a +b  \n224=76a +b  \n\nSubtract first equation from second:\n\n148=27a \u2192 a=148/27\u22485.481, not integer.\n\nThus, no solution. So the same conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a second order recurrence k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2}\n\nThen for n=7: k7 = a k6 +b k5 \u219276=49a +21b  \nFor n=8:224=76a +49b\n\nThen solve:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76  \nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nMultiply equation1 by 49 and equation2 by21:\n\nEquation1*49: 2401a + 1029b = 3724  \nEquation2*21: 1596a +1029b = 4704  \n\nSubtract equation1*49 - equation2*21:\n\n(2401a -1596a) + (1029b-1029b)=3724-4704  \n805a = -980 \u2192 a= -980/805= -28/23 \u2248-1.217\n\nThen substitute back into equation1:\n\n49*(-28/23) +21b=76  \n-1372/23 +21b=76  \n21b=76 +1372/23 = (1748 +1372)/23=3120/23  \nb=3120/(23*21)= 3120/483= 1040/161\u22486.46\n\nThus, again non-integer.\n\nTherefore, regardless of first or second order, the coefficients are non-integer. So the answer is no.\n\nHence, the final answer is \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}\n",
