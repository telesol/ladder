  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. The user is asking about potential connections between some numbers (k8, k7, k6, etc.) and the golden ratio (phi) or Fibonacci numbers. They provided some ratios and noticed that k7/k6 is close to phi (around 1.55 vs. phi's 1.618) and k5/k4 is close to phi squared (2.625 vs. 2.618). Also, they mentioned checking higher terms like k14/k13, etc. So, my job is to see if there's a deeper Fibonacci or golden ratio pattern here.\n\nFirst, let me list out the given ratios:\n\n- k8/k7 = 224/76 \u2248 2.947 (not phi)\n- k7/k6 = 76/49 \u2248 1.551 (close to phi)\n- k6/k5 = 49/21 \u2248 2.333\n- k5/k4 = 21/8 \u2248 2.625 (close to phi squared)\n- k4/k3 = 8/7 \u2248 1.143\n- k3/k2 = 7/3 \u2248 2.333\n\nAnd the higher terms:\n\n- k14/k13 \u2248 10544/5765 \u2248 1.829\n- k13/k12 \u2248 5765/2683 \u2248 2.148\n- k12/k11 \u2248 2683/1155 \u2248 2.323\n\nHmm. The user noticed that k5/k4 is very close to phi squared, which is 2.618, but their calculation here is 21/8 = 2.625, which is indeed very close. Similarly, k7/k6 is 76/49 \u2248 1.551, which is somewhat near phi (1.618). The other ratios like 2.333 and 2.323 are similar but not as close. The higher terms like k14/k13 \u22481.829, which is still not exactly phi but maybe related?\n\nFirst, maybe the sequence of k terms is following a Fibonacci-like recurrence? Let me see if the numbers given can be part of a Fibonacci sequence. Let me note the values they mentioned:\n\nAssuming the terms are k2, k3, k4, k5, k6, k7, k8:\n\nk2=3, k3=7, k4=8, k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224.\n\nWait, hold on, let me confirm that. For example, if k3/k2=7/3\u22482.333, then k3=7, k2=3. Then k4/k3=8/7\u22481.143, so k4=8. Then k5/k4=21/8\u22482.625, so k5=21. Then k6/k5=49/21\u22482.333, so k6=49. k7/k6=76/49\u22481.551, so k7=76. k8/k7=224/76\u22482.947, so k8=224. \n\nSo the sequence is: \n\nk2=3,\n\nk3=7,\n\nk4=8,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nand then continuing on, they mentioned k11=1155, k12=2683, k13=5765, k14=10544.\n\nWait, that's a lot. Let me check the ratios between these higher terms. For instance, k14/k13 \u22481.829, k13/k12\u22482.148, k12/k11\u22482.323.\n\nSo, first, let me see if this sequence follows a linear recurrence relation. Fibonacci numbers follow F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). Maybe this sequence is following a similar pattern but with different coefficients? Let me check:\n\nStarting with the given terms:\n\nk2=3,\n\nk3=7,\n\nk4=8,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nk9=?\n\nWait, but the user didn't give k9, k10, so maybe we can try to see if the recurrence is consistent?\n\nLet's see if each term is the sum of previous terms. Let's try:\n\nk4=8. Is that related to k3 and k2? 7 +3=10, which is more than 8. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k4 = k3 + k2? 7+3=10 \u22608. Not quite.\n\nWait, maybe another recurrence? Let's see:\n\nLooking at k5=21. Let's see:\n\nIf it's k5 = k4 + k3 =8 +7=15 \u226021.\n\nHmm, not that. What about k5 = 2*k4 + something? 2*8=16. 16 +5=21? Not sure. Maybe a different combination.\n\nAlternatively, looking at k6=49. Let me see:\n\nk6=49. Maybe k6= k5 +k4? 21 +8=29\u226049. Not.\n\nAlternatively, 2*k5 +k4? 2*21 +8=42+8=50, which is close but not exact.\n\nWait, perhaps a third order recurrence? Let's check.\n\nSuppose the recurrence is of the form k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2} + c*k_{n-3}?\n\nThis might be complicated, but let's try with the first few terms.\n\nTake k5=21. Suppose it's a linear combination of k4=8, k3=7, and k2=3.\n\nSo 21 = a*8 + b*7 + c*3.\n\nSimilarly, k6=49 = a*k5 + b*k4 + c*k3 = a*21 + b*8 + c*7.\n\nk7=76 = a*49 + b*21 + c*8.\n\nHmm, this seems too many variables. Maybe it's a second-order recurrence but with coefficients other than 1?\n\nLet me suppose that k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2}\n\nWe can set up equations:\n\nk4 = a*k3 + b*k2 \u2192 8 = a*7 + b*3,\n\nk5 = a*k4 + b*k3 \u219221 = a*8 + b*7,\n\nk6 = a*k5 + b*k4 \u219249 = a*21 + b*8,\n\nLet me see if this holds.\n\nFirst equation: 8 =7a +3b,\n\nSecond:21=8a +7b,\n\nThird:49=21a +8b.\n\nLet me solve first two equations for a and b.\n\nFrom first equation: 7a +3b =8,\n\nSecond equation:8a +7b =21.\n\nMultiply first equation by 8: 56a +24b =64,\n\nMultiply second by 7:56a +49b=147,\n\nSubtract first from second: (56a +49b) - (56a +24b) =147 -64 \u219225b=83 \u2192 b=83/25\u22483.32,\n\nThen plug back into first equation:7a +3*(83/25)=8 \u21927a =8 - (249/25)= (200 -249)/25= -49/25 \u2192 a= -49/(25*7)= -7/25\u2248-0.28\n\nHmm, so a\u2248-0.28, b\u22483.32. Let's check the third equation:\n\n21a +8b \u224821*(-0.28) +8*(3.32)= -5.88 +26.56\u224820.68, but the third equation requires 49. Not close. So that doesn't work. So maybe not a 2nd order linear recurrence.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let's see the numbers given:\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\nk2=3,\n\nk3=7,\n\nk4=8,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nk11=1155,\n\nk12=2683,\n\nk13=5765,\n\nk14=10544.\n\nWait, the user mentions \"k14/k13=10544/5765\u22481.829, k13/k12\u22482.148, k12/k11\u22482.323\".\n\nI notice that the higher terms' ratios are approaching something? Let me see:\n\nk14/k13\u22481.829,\n\nk13/k12\u22482.148,\n\nk12/k11\u22482.323.\n\nHmm, not sure if approaching phi or something else. Let me see the entire sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these numbers are part of a Fibonacci-like sequence but with different starting values? Let me see:\n\nSuppose starting with k1 and k2, but the user starts at k2=3. Let me assume starting at k1=1, k2=3, then k3=7. If it's a Fibonacci-like sequence, k3=k1 +k2=1+3=4\u22607. Not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k3=2*k2 + something? 2*3=6, plus 1 gives 7. Then k4=2*k3 + something? 2*7=14, but k4=8. Hmm, not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplying by some factor? Let's see:\n\nFrom k2=3 to k3=7: 3*2 +1=7,\n\nk3=7 to k4=8:7 +1=8,\n\nk4=8 to k5=21:8*2 +5=21,\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's related to the Fibonacci sequence multiplied by some numbers? Let me check Fibonacci numbers:\n\nFibonacci numbers starting from F1=1, F2=1, F3=2, F4=3, F5=5, F6=8, F7=13, F8=21, F9=34, F10=55, F11=89, F12=144, F13=233, F14=377, etc.\n\nComparing to the given k terms:\n\nk2=3 (F4=3),\n\nk3=7 (near F6=8, but 7 is F7-1),\n\nk4=8 (F6),\n\nk5=21 (F8),\n\nk6=49 (F11 is 89, so not close),\n\nk7=76 (F11=89? Hmm, 76 is less),\n\nWait, maybe if multiplied by some factor? Let's see:\n\nIf k5=21 is F8=21. So that's exact. Then k4=8 is F6=8. k3=7 is close to F7=13? No, not really. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, starting from another point. Let me see:\n\nk2=3,\n\nk3=7,\n\nk4=8,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nLooking at these numbers, perhaps they follow a pattern where each term is roughly 2.6 times the previous? Let me see:\n\n76*2.6=197.6 vs k8=224. Hmm, no, not exact.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio between k5 and k4 is 21/8\u22482.625, which is close to phi squared (2.618). Similarly, k7/k6\u22481.551 close to phi (1.618). Maybe this is a hint?\n\nLet me see if these ratios are approaching phi or phi squared. For example, in Fibonacci numbers, the ratio between consecutive terms approaches phi. Similarly, here, maybe some of these ratios are approaching phi or its square.\n\nLooking at the given ratios:\n\nk7/k6\u22481.55 (close to phi),\n\nk5/k4\u22482.625 (close to phi squared),\n\nBut then k6/k5\u22482.333, which is between phi and phi squared?\n\nWait, phi squared is about 2.618, so 2.333 is actually closer to 2.333, which is 21/9? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the odd and even terms have different behaviors? Let me see:\n\nLooking at the higher terms given:\n\nk11=1155,\n\nk12=2683,\n\nk13=5765,\n\nk14=10544.\n\nk14/k13\u22481.829,\n\nk13/k12\u22482.148,\n\nk12/k11\u22482.323.\n\nHmm, so the ratios here are decreasing? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire sequence is following a recurrence relation involving phi? For Fibonacci, the recurrence is F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). Maybe here it's a similar recurrence but with coefficients related to phi?\n\nAlternatively, let me see if the terms can be expressed in terms of Fibonacci numbers. Let's list Fibonacci numbers up to F14:\n\nF1=1,\n\nF2=1,\n\nF3=2,\n\nF4=3,\n\nF5=5,\n\nF6=8,\n\nF7=13,\n\nF8=21,\n\nF9=34,\n\nF10=55,\n\nF11=89,\n\nF12=144,\n\nF13=233,\n\nF14=377,\n\nF15=610,\n\nF16=987,\n\nF17=1597,\n\nF18=2584,\n\nF19=4181,\n\nF20=6765,\n\nF21=10946,\n\nF22=17711,\n\nF23=28657,\n\nF24=46368,\n\nHmm, let me see if the k terms can be related to Fibonacci numbers:\n\nk2=3 is F4,\n\nk3=7: Not a Fibonacci number,\n\nk4=8=F6,\n\nk5=21=F8,\n\nk6=49: Not Fibonacci,\n\nk7=76: Not Fibonacci,\n\nk8=224: Not Fibonacci,\n\nHmm, but maybe multiplied by some factor?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different starting point? For example, if starting at F5=5, then:\n\nF5=5, F6=8, F7=13, F8=21, F9=34, F10=55, F11=89, F12=144, etc.\n\nk5=21=F8,\n\nk4=8=F6,\n\nk3=7 is between F7=13 and F5=5. Not quite.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is a Fibonacci sequence starting with different initial terms. Let me see:\n\nSuppose we have a sequence where each term is the sum of the two previous terms, but starting with different numbers. Let me try to see if the given terms can be part of such a sequence.\n\nSuppose starting with k1=1, k2=3 (so k2=3 as given). Then k3= k2 +k1=4, but given k3=7, so that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k1=2, k2=3: k3=5, still not 7.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a different recurrence, like k_n = k_{n-1} + 2*k_{n-2}?\n\nLet me test:\n\nSuppose k3= k2 + 2*k1. If k2=3, then k3=3 +2*k1. If k3=7, then 3 +2*k1=7 \u21922*k1=4\u2192k1=2.\n\nSo if we set k1=2, k2=3, then k3=7. Then k4= k3 +2*k2=7 +6=13, but given k4=8, so no.\n\nHmm, not working.\n\nAlternatively, k_n = 2*k_{n-1} - k_{n-2}?\n\nTesting:\n\nk3=2*k2 -k1. If k3=7, then 2*3 -k1=7\u21926 -k1=7\u2192k1= -1. Probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a different recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the terms:\n\nk2=3,\n\nk3=7,\n\nk4=8,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nHmm, let me see the differences between terms:\n\nk3 -k2=4,\n\nk4 -k3=1,\n\nk5 -k4=13,\n\nk6 -k5=28,\n\nk7 -k6=27,\n\nk8 -k7=148,\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is related to the Fibonacci sequence multiplied by some numbers and added together? For example, maybe k_n = F_{2n} ?\n\nLet me see:\n\nF_4=3 (k2=3),\n\nF_6=8 (k4=8),\n\nF_8=21 (k5=21),\n\nHmm, but k3 would be F_5=5, which is not 7. Close but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, k_n = F_{2n-2} ?\n\nThen k2=F2=1, which is not 3.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are related to Lucas numbers? Lucas numbers start with L1=1, L2=3, L3=4, L4=7, L5=11, L6=18, L7=29, L8=47, L9=76, L10=123, L11=199, L12=322, etc.\n\nComparing to k terms:\n\nk2=3 (L2=3),\n\nk3=7 (L4=7),\n\nk4=8 (L5=11? No),\n\nHmm, k4=8 is not a Lucas number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a combination of Fibonacci and Lucas?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms are every third Fibonacci number? Let me see:\n\nF4=3 (k2),\n\nF7=13 (not k3=7),\n\nHmm, not.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if the terms can be expressed as combinations:\n\nk5=21, which is F8,\n\nk6=49: 49 is 34 +15, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is following a pattern where every other term is multiplied by a certain factor. For instance:\n\nk2=3,\n\nk3=7 (maybe 3*2 +1),\n\nk4=8 (7 +1),\n\nk5=21 (8*2 +5),\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the higher terms given:\n\nk11=1155,\n\nk12=2683,\n\nk13=5765,\n\nk14=10544.\n\nLooking at these, maybe the ratio between k14 and k13 is about 1.829, k13/k12\u22482.148, k12/k11\u22482.323.\n\nHmm, perhaps approaching a certain limit? Let me see:\n\nThe Fibonacci ratio approaches phi\u22481.618, but here the ratios are higher. Alternatively, maybe approaching (1+sqrt(5))^2? Let's compute (1+\u221a5)^2 =1 + 2\u221a5 +5=6+2\u221a5\u22486+4.472\u224810.472, which is too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio approaches phi squared? phi squared is about 2.618. But the ratios here are 1.829, 2.148, 2.323, which are below that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the even and odd terms have different ratios? For example, even terms approach one ratio and odd terms another?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is defined by a second-order linear recurrence with constant coefficients, but the coefficients are not integers. Let me try to find a recurrence relation for the terms given.\n\nSuppose the recurrence is k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2}\n\nLet me try to find a and b using the terms given.\n\nUsing k5=21, k4=8, k3=7, k2=3.\n\nLet me set up equations:\n\nFor n=5: 21 = a*8 + b*7,\n\nFor n=6:49 = a*21 + b*8,\n\nNow solve for a and b.\n\nEquation1: 8a +7b =21,\n\nEquation2:21a +8b=49,\n\nMultiply Equation1 by 3:24a +21b=63,\n\nSubtract Equation2: (24a +21b) - (21a +8b)=63-49,\n\n3a +13b=14,\n\nHmm, now we have:\n\nEquation1:8a +7b=21,\n\nEquation2:3a +13b=14,\n\nLet me solve these equations.\n\nMultiply Equation1 by 3:24a +21b=63,\n\nMultiply Equation2 by 8:24a +104b=112,\n\nSubtract first from second:\n\n(24a +104b) - (24a +21b)=112-63,\n\n83b=49,\n\nThus b=49/83\u22480.590,\n\nThen from Equation1:8a +7*(49/83)=21,\n\n8a =21 - (343/83)= (1743 - 343)/83=1400/83,\n\nThus a=1400/(83*8)=1400/664\u22482.108.\n\nSo the recurrence would be k_n\u22482.108*k_{n-1} +0.590*k_{n-2}.\n\nLet me test this with k7=76:\n\nUsing n=7: a*k6 +b*k5 \u22482.108*49 +0.590*21\u2248103.292 +12.39\u2248115.682, but k7=76, which is way off. So this approach isn't working.\n\nHmm, maybe the recurrence is of higher order?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are following a different pattern. Let me see the ratios between the terms:\n\nk3/k2 =7/3\u22482.333,\n\nk4/k3=8/7\u22481.142,\n\nk5/k4=21/8\u22482.625,\n\nk6/k5=49/21\u22482.333,\n\nk7/k6=76/49\u22481.551,\n\nk8/k7=224/76\u22482.947,\n\nHmm, the ratios are fluctuating. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are part of a sequence defined by a tribonacci-like recurrence? Let me try with three previous terms.\n\nAssume k_n = a*k_{n-1} +b*k_{n-2} +c*k_{n-3}\n\nUsing terms up to k8:\n\nEquations:\n\nk5 = a*k4 +b*k3 +c*k2 \u219221 =8a +7b +3c,\n\nk6 =a*k5 +b*k4 +c*k3 \u219249=21a +8b +7c,\n\nk7 =a*k6 +b*k5 +c*k4 \u219276=49a +21b +8c,\n\nk8 =a*k7 +b*k6 +c*k5 \u2192224=76a +49b +21c.\n\nThis is four equations with three unknowns. Let me try with first three equations:\n\nEquation1:8a +7b +3c=21,\n\nEquation2:21a +8b +7c=49,\n\nEquation3:49a +21b +8c=76,\n\nLet me solve Equations1 and 2 first.\n\nMultiply Equation1 by 3:24a +21b +9c=63,\n\nMultiply Equation2 by 1:21a +8b +7c=49,\n\nSubtract Equation2 from Equation1*3:\n\n(24a -21a)+(21b -8b)+(9c -7c)=63-49,\n\n3a +13b +2c=14,\n\nEquation4:3a +13b +2c=14,\n\nNow use Equation3:49a +21b +8c=76,\n\nLet me try to eliminate variables. Let me express c from Equation1:\n\nFrom Equation1:3c=21 -8a -7b \u2192 c=(21 -8a -7b)/3,\n\nPlug into Equation4:\n\n3a +13b +2*(21 -8a -7b)/3 =14,\n\nMultiply all terms by 3 to eliminate denominator:\n\n9a +39b +2*(21 -8a -7b)=42,\n\nExpand:\n\n9a +39b +42 -16a -14b =42,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(9a -16a) + (39b -14b) +42 =42,\n\n-7a +25b +42 =42,\n\n-7a +25b =0,\n\nThus 25b=7a \u2192 b=(7/25)a,\n\nNow plug back into c expression:\n\nc=(21 -8a -7b)/3,\n\nSubstitute b=(7/25)a,\n\nc=(21 -8a -7*(7/25)a)/3,\n\nc=(21 -8a -49a/25)/3,\n\n= (21 - (200a +49a)/25)/3,\n\n= (21 -249a/25)/3,\n\n= (525/25 -249a/25)/3,\n\n= (525 -249a)/75,\n\nNow plug b and c into Equation3:\n\n49a +21*(7a/25) +8*((525 -249a)/75)=76,\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term:49a,\n\nSecond term:21*(7a)/25= (147a)/25,\n\nThird term:8*(525 -249a)/75= (4200 -1992a)/75,\n\nCombine all terms:\n\n49a + (147a)/25 + (4200 -1992a)/75 =76,\n\nMultiply all terms by 75 to eliminate denominators:\n\n49a*75 +147a*3 +4200 -1992a =76*75,\n\nCompute each term:\n\n49a*75 =3675a,\n\n147a*3=441a,\n\n4200 remains,\n\n-1992a,\n\nRHS=5700,\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(3675a +441a -1992a) +4200 =5700,\n\n(3675+441-1992)a +4200 =5700,\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\n3675 +441=4116; 4116-1992=2124,\n\nThus 2124a +4200 =5700,\n\n2124a=5700-4200=1500,\n\na=1500/2124=250/354\u22480.706,\n\nHmm, a\u22480.706,\n\nThen b=(7/25)*0.706\u22480.2,\n\nc=(525 -249*(0.706))/75,\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n249*0.706\u2248249*0.7=174.3; 249*0.006=1.494 \u2192 total\u2248175.794,\n\n525 -175.794\u2248349.206,\n\nThen c\u2248349.206/75\u22484.656,\n\nNow check if these a\u22480.706, b\u22480.2, c\u22484.656 satisfy the equations,\n\nLet me check Equation1:\n\n8a +7b +3c\u22488*0.706 +7*0.2 +3*4.656\u22485.648 +1.4 +13.968\u224821.016 which is close to 21,\n\nEquation2:\n\n21a +8b +7c\u224821*0.706 +8*0.2 +7*4.656\u224814.826 +1.6 +32.592\u224849.018, close to 49,\n\nEquation3:\n\n49a +21b +8c\u224849*0.706 +21*0.2 +8*4.656\u224834.594 +4.2 +37.248\u224876.042, which is close,\n\nNow check equation4 (from earlier steps):\n\nEquation4:3a +13b +2c\u22483*0.706 +13*0.2 +2*4.656\u22482.118 +2.6 +9.312\u224813.03, but Equation4 was 3a +13b +2c=14,\n\nHmm, discrepancy here. Maybe rounding errors? Since we approximated a,b,c,\n\nBut the main point is that this gives a possible recurrence relation, but it's messy and the numbers aren't integers. Maybe this sequence is not a standard linear recurrence? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are related to factorials or combinatorial numbers?\n\nk2=3, k3=7, k4=8, k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224,\n\nLooking at 21, 49, 76, 224: 21 is 3*7, 49 is7^2, 76 is 4*19, 224 is 16*14. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is the number of something, like subsets with certain properties? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of two sequences interleaved? For example, if we separate even and odd terms:\n\nOdd indices (starting from k2=3 as n=2):\n\nk2=3, k4=8, k6=49, k8=224,\n\nEven indices (k3=7, k5=21, k7=76):\n\nLooking at the odd indices:\n\n3,8,49,224,\n\nCheck ratios: 8/3\u22482.666, 49/8\u22486.125, 224/49\u22484.571,\n\nHmm, not a clear pattern.\n\nEven indices:7,21,76,\n\n21/7=3, 76/21\u22483.619,\n\nNot obvious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is the result of a specific recurrence relation that isn't linear? Maybe exponential?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are part of a known sequence in the OEIS (Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences). Let me try to check.\n\nLooking up the sequence 3,7,8,21,49,76,224 in OEIS.\n\nWait, I can't actually access OEIS right now, but maybe I can think of possible patterns.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's a pattern in the terms:\n\nLooking at k2=3,\n\nk3=7 \u2192 3*2 +1,\n\nk4=8 \u21927 +1,\n\nk5=21 \u21928*2 +5,\n\nk6=49 \u219221*2 +7,\n\nk7=76 \u219249 +27,\n\nk8=224 \u219276*3 -4,\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, considering the terms:\n\nk2=3,\n\nk3=3 +4=7,\n\nk4=7 +1=8,\n\nk5=8 +13=21,\n\nk6=21 +28=49,\n\nk7=49 +27=76,\n\nk8=76 +148=224,\n\nThe added numbers are:4,1,13,28,27,148.\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the added numbers are related to Fibonacci numbers or other.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined by a second-order recurrence with variable coefficients, but that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the user hasn't actually asked a question yet, but just provided a problem statement (the initial instruction was to answer the user's question, and the user's message is \"G\", which might be a typo or mistranscription). Wait, looking back:\n\nWait the user wrote:\n\n\"G\n\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\n",
