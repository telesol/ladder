  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. The user is asking about square root patterns in a sequence of numbers labeled k5 to k16. From the observed example, they noticed that k13 is equal to k7 squared minus 11, which gives 5776 - 11 = 5765. They also provided some square roots of other k terms and want to know if there are other similar square-based formulas. \n\nFirst, let me list out the given information:\n\n- k13 = k7\u00b2 - 11 = 5776 - 11 = 5765\n- The square roots of other k terms are checked:\n  1. \u221ak5 \u2248 4.58 (non-integer)\n  2. \u221ak6 = 7 (integer, so k6 = k3\u00b2, meaning k3 must be 7)\n  3. \u221ak8 \u2248 14.97 (close to 15, but not exactly)\n  4. \u221ak11 \u2248 33.98 (close to 34)\n  5. \u221ak13 \u2248 75.93 (close to k7=76)\n  6. \u221ak14 \u2248 102.68\n\nThe questions posed are:\n- Why is \u221ak13 \u2248 k7? Because k13 = k7\u00b2 - 11. That makes sense since 76\u00b2 is 5776, so subtracting 11 gives 5765, whose square root is just slightly less than 76.\n- Is \u221ak14 \u2248 some key? The square root is approximately 102.68. Maybe there's another term close to this? Let's see if there's a k term around 102 or 103. Since the keys are labeled sequentially, maybe k10 or k12? But we don't have their values yet. Alternatively, maybe 102.68 is close to another existing key's value? For example, k14 is around 10544, so sqrt(k14) is ~102.68. Maybe it's close to k something? Hmm, not sure yet.\n- For k15 = k8\u00b2 - C, what C makes k15 in the range [16384, 32767]? Since k8 is 224 (since sqrt(k8) \u224814.97, so 15\u00b2 is 225, so k8 is 224?), so 224 squared is 50176. Wait, but if k15 = 224\u00b2 - C, then 50176 - C must be between 16384 and 32767. So solving for C: C = 50176 - k15. To have k15 in that range, C must be between 50176 - 32767 = 17409 and 50176 - 16384 = 33792. Hmm, so C is between ~17,409 and 33,792. But I'm not sure how to determine C here without more info.\n\nThe user also wants to find square patterns for k14, k15, k16. Let me try to see if there's a pattern here.\n\nFirst, let's note the known values:\n\n- k6 = 49 (since sqrt(k6)=7)\n- k7 = 76 (since k7 squared is part of the equation for k13)\n- k8 \u2248 224 (since sqrt(k8)\u224814.97, so 14.97 squared is about 224)\n- k11 \u2248 1155 (sqrt(k11)=33.98, so 34 squared is 1156, so k11 is 1155)\n- k13 = 5765 (from given)\n- k14 = 10544 (since sqrt(k14)=~102.68, so 102.68 squared is approx 10544)\n\nWait, actually, sqrt(k14) is given as \u2248102.68, so k14 is approximately (102.68)^2. Let me compute that exactly to check:\n\n102.68 squared: (102 + 0.68)^2 = 102^2 + 2*102*0.68 + 0.68^2 = 10404 + 139.68 + 0.4624 \u2248 10404 + 140.14 \u2248 10544.14. So yes, k14 is 10544.\n\nSimilarly, k8 is approximately 224, since sqrt(224) is sqrt(16*14) = 4*sqrt(14) \u2248 4*3.7417 \u2248 14.966, which matches the given sqrt(k8)\u224814.97. So k8 is 224.\n\nk11 is sqrt(1155) \u224833.98, so 34 squared is 1156, so k11 is 1155, which is 34\u00b2 -1.\n\nSimilarly, k13 is 76\u00b2 -11, so close to a square minus a small number.\n\nk6 is exactly 7 squared, so k3 must be 7 (since k6 =k3 squared). So k3 is 7.\n\nNow, trying to see patterns here:\n\nLooking at k3=7, k7=76, k13=5765. Wait, these numbers seem to follow a pattern? Let's see:\n\nk3=7\n\nk7=76. Hmm, 76 is 7*10 + 6? Not sure.\n\nk13=5765. 5765 is 76 squared minus 11, as given. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the indices: 3,7,13. The indices are increasing by 4, then 6? Not sure.\n\nLooking at the square roots of the other terms:\n\nsqrt(k5)=~4.58: so k5 is about 21 (since 4.58\u00b2 \u224821). The user wrote sqrt(k5)=sqrt(21), so k5 is 21.\n\nsqrt(k6)=7, so k6 is 49.\n\nsqrt(k8)=~14.97, so k8 is 224.\n\nsqrt(k11)=~33.98, so k11 is 1155.\n\nsqrt(k13)=~75.93, so k13 is 5765.\n\nsqrt(k14)=~102.68, so k14 is 10544.\n\nNow, trying to see if these numbers can be expressed in terms of previous keys or some squares.\n\nStarting with k6=49=7\u00b2, and since k3=7, so k6=k3\u00b2. That's a clear pattern.\n\nSimilarly, k7 is 76. Let me see if 76 is part of a square. 76 squared is 5776, which is related to k13.\n\nk8 is 224. Hmm, 224 is 14*16, but sqrt(224) is approx 14.966, so close to 15\u00b2=225. So k8 is 15\u00b2 -1 = 225-1=224. So that's a possible pattern: k8 = 15\u00b2 -1. So if we follow that, then sqrt(k8) is sqrt(15\u00b2 -1), which is just under 15.\n\nSimilarly, k11 is 34\u00b2 -1= 1156 -1=1155. Because sqrt(k11) is close to 34, so exactly 34\u00b2 minus 1.\n\nThen k13 is 76\u00b2 -11, which is similar but the subtracted constant is 11 instead of 1. Hmm. Maybe there's a progression here?\n\nLooking at the indices:\n\nk8 is at position 8, which is 2 more than 6. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the subtracted constants:\n\nFor k8: 15\u00b2 -1. So subtract 1.\n\nFor k11: 34\u00b2 -1. Subtract 1 again.\n\nFor k13: 76\u00b2 -11. Subtract 11.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the subtracted constant is increasing? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the constants relate to previous terms?\n\nWait, 15 is k8's square root (approx), and 15 is 3*5, but maybe 15 is related to previous terms?\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the square terms:\n\nk3=7, then k6=7\u00b2=49\n\nk7=76. Maybe k7 is related to k3 somehow? 76 could be 7*11 - something? Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if there's a pattern between the square roots and the keys:\n\nFor k8: sqrt(k8)=14.97 ~15, so 15^2 -1=224.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(k11)=33.98 ~34, so 34^2 -1=1155.\n\nsqrt(k13)=75.93 ~76, so 76^2 -11=5765.\n\nSo here, for k8, k11, k13, they are each of the form (n)^2 -1, except k13 is minus 11 instead of minus 1. Maybe there's an inconsistency here or a progression?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the subtracted constants are following a pattern. For k8: 15^2 -1, k11: 34^2 -1, k13:76^2 -11. Wait, 1,1,11? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the subtracted constants are related to the index? Let's see:\n\nk8: index 8, subtract 1? 8-7=1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's see the numbers 15, 34, 76. These numbers themselves might form a sequence. Let's see:\n\n15 to 34: difference 19\n\n34 to 76: difference 42\n\nHmm, 15, 34, 76. Maybe each is double the previous plus something? 15*2=30, plus 4=34. 34*2=68 +8=76. The added numbers are 4,8... doubling? 4,8, maybe next would be 16? Let's see next term.\n\nAlternatively, looking at those numbers:\n\n15, 34, 76. Let me see if they are related to previous k terms.\n\nk3=7, then 15=7*2 +1? 7*2=14 +1=15? Maybe.\n\nThen 34=15*2 +4? 15*2=30 +4=34.\n\n76=34*2 +8? 34*2=68 +8=76.\n\nSo the added numbers are 1,4,8. Which are powers of 2? 1=2^0, 4=2^2, 8=2^3. Hmm, not exactly a clean progression, but maybe.\n\nAlternatively, 1, 4, 8 is adding 3 then 4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the multipliers:\n\n15 is 7*2 +1,\n\nthen 34 is 15*2 +4,\n\nthen 76 is 34*2 +8,\n\nthen maybe next is 76*2 + something? If following powers of 2, next would be 16? 76*2=152 +16=168? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the added terms are multiplied by 2 each time: 1, then 4 (1*4?), 8 (4*2). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these numbers (15, 34, 76) are part of another sequence. Let me check if they are Fibonacci-like? 15+34=49, which is k6, interesting! 15+34=49. So 15 is maybe related to k8's sqrt, 34 is sqrt(k11), and their sum is k6=49. Hmm, that's an interesting connection.\n\nSimilarly, 34 +76=110. Not sure if that relates to another key. Wait k13 is 5765, sqrt(k13)=~76, so 76 is part of that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms 15, 34,76 correspond to keys plus some offset. Not sure yet.\n\nMoving on to the questions:\n\nFirst, the user asks to check each of the square roots given, and then to investigate why sqrt(k13) is close to k7 (because k13 is k7 squared minus 11). Then, they want to know if sqrt(k14) is close to some key. sqrt(k14) is ~102.68. Let's see what key is around that value. The keys given so far up to k14 are:\n\nk3=7,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nk11=1155,\n\nk13=5765,\n\nk14=10544.\n\nWait, the sqrt(k14)=~102.68 is not a key number yet. The keys are numbered by their subscript, so the value of k10, for example, isn't given. But since the keys go up to k16, maybe there's a k term with a value near 102? Let's see:\n\nLooking at previous keys:\n\nk7=76, which is less than 102,\n\nk8=224 is way higher,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk11=1155 is even higher. Hmm. Maybe it's a combination? Like 102.68 is between k7 and k8? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's close to 102.68 is approximately 102.68, so maybe 103? But there's no key at 103. Alternatively, maybe it's part of another formula. Let me see if 102.68 squared is exactly k14=10544, so sqrt(k14)=102.68 is exact? Let me compute 102.68 squared more precisely.\n\nWait, actually, the user says sqrt(k14)=~102.68, so maybe k14 is exactly (102 + a)^2. Let me check 102 squared is 10404, 103 squared is 10609. The given k14 is 10544. So 10544 is between 102\u00b2 and 103\u00b2, exactly 10544-10404=140, so 102\u00b2 +140 =10544, so sqrt(k14)=102 + sqrt(140)/something? Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a formula. Let me see if 10544 relates to another square.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k14 is related to another key squared. Let me check if 10544 is close to (k something)^2. For example, sqrt(10544)=~102.68, so perhaps close to 103 squared (10609)? The difference is 10609-10544=65. So 10544=103\u00b2 -65. So that's a possible formula? If that's the case, then k14 = 103\u00b2 -65. But does that relate to any previous keys? 103 isn't a key value I can see yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k14 is related to k7 or k8. Let's see, 76 (k7) squared is 5776, which is half of k13 (5765?) Wait, k13 is 5765? No, 76 squared is 5776, so 5776-11=5765, which is k13. So k13 is k7 squared minus 11.\n\nSimilarly, k8 is 224, which is 15 squared minus 1 (225-1=224). k11 is 34 squared minus1. So maybe the pattern is that for keys at indices 6,8,11,13, etc., they are squares of some numbers minus 1 or something. Let me check the indices:\n\nk6=49=7\u00b2, which is different.\n\nk8=15\u00b2 -1,\n\nk11=34\u00b2 -1,\n\nk13=76\u00b2 -11.\n\nHmm. The indices 6,8,11,13 don't follow a clear pattern. Maybe they are every few steps?\n\nAlternatively, the numbers 7,15,34,76: each is double the previous plus something?\n\n7*2 +1=15,\n\n15*2 +4=34,\n\n34*2 +8=76,\n\nso the added numbers are 1,4,8, which are 2^0, 2^2, 2^3. Maybe next would be 2^4=16?\n\nThen 76*2 +16=168, so next would be 168\u00b2 minus something?\n\nAlternatively, the next term after 76 would be 168, so if following the pattern of subtracting 1, then maybe k16 would be 168\u00b2 - something?\n\nBut the user is asking about k14. Let's see. sqrt(k14)=~102.68, so the number 102.68 could be related to a previous term? 102.68 is roughly between 76 and 150? Maybe 102 is part of another sequence? Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if there's a pattern with the subtracted numbers. For k8: subtract 1, k11 subtract 1, k13 subtract 11. The subtracted numbers are 1,1,11. Maybe they are doubling and adding? 1+0=1, then 1+10=11? Not sure. Alternatively, 1,1,11 might be part of a Fibonacci-like sequence? 1+1=2, but next is 11. Hmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the subtracted number is the previous subtracted number multiplied by some factor plus something. From 1 to 1, then 1 to 11: times 11? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the subtracted number corresponds to the difference between the square roots? For example, between 15 and 34, the difference is 19. But 1 to 1 is 0, so maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the subtracted number is the index difference? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think differently. Let's see the keys that have been defined so far:\n\nk3=7,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nk11=1155,\n\nk13=5765,\n\nk14=10544.\n\nWait, perhaps the keys at indices 3,5,6,7,8,11,13,14 are part of a sequence where each term is generated by some formula. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the values:\n\nk3=7,\n\nk5=21. 21 is 7*3,\n\nk6=49. 49 is 7\u00b2,\n\nk7=76. 76 is 49 +27,\n\nk8=224. 224 is 76*3 -4,\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, 7, 21, 49,76,224,1155,5765,10544. Maybe these numbers are part of a Fibonacci-like sequence where each term is the sum of previous terms? Let's see:\n\n21=7+14? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 21 is 7*3,\n\n49 is 21 +28,\n\n76 is 49 +27,\n\n224 is 76*3 -4,\n\nHmm, not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, let me look at the positions and see if they relate to the numbers:\n\nk3=7 (3rd term),\n\nk5=21 (5th term),\n\nk6=49 (6th term),\n\nk7=76 (7th term),\n\nk8=224 (8th term),\n\nk11=1155 (11th term),\n\nk13=5765 (13th term),\n\nk14=10544 (14th term).\n\nWait, the indices where the keys are defined seem to be primes or something? 3,5,7,11,13 are primes, but 6,8,14 are not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are following two interleaved sequences? For example, odd indices and even indices?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the values:\n\nk3=7,\n\nk5=21 (which is 3*7),\n\nk7=76,\n\nk11=1155,\n\nk13=5765,\n\nso maybe the odd indices have a different pattern than even indices? Let's see:\n\nEven indices:\n\nk6=49,\n\nk8=224,\n\nk14=10544,\n\nHmm, 49=7\u00b2,\n\n224=15\u00b2 -1,\n\n10544=102.68\u00b2,\n\nWait, 10544 divided by 49 is roughly 215.2, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 49, 224, 10544. Let me see:\n\n224 is 49*4.57, not a whole number.\n\nAlternatively, 49*4=196, 224-196=28.\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, 224 is 224= 15\u00b2 -1,\n\n10544 is sqrt(10544)=~102.68, so maybe 102.68 squared minus some number?\n\nWait, if k14 is part of the pattern similar to k8, k11, k13, which were squares minus 1 or 11, then maybe sqrt(k14) is close to a square, so sqrt(k14)=~102.68 is near 103^2=10609, so k14=103^2 -65. So if that's the case, the subtracted number here would be 65, but why 65? Maybe it's part of the previous subtracted numbers (1,1,11,65?), which could be multiplied by something: 1 to 11 is *11, 11 to 65 is *6? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 65 is 5*13. Hmm, 13 is the index of the previous term (k13). Maybe the subtracted number is the index? For k8 (index 8): subtracted 1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the formula for the terms.\n\nLooking at k8=15^2 -1, where 15 is the square root rounded up,\n\nk11=34^2 -1,\n\nk13=76^2 -11,\n\nk14=103^2 -65? If we follow that pattern, the numbers 15,34,76,103... maybe they have their own pattern.\n\nLooking at 15,34,76,103:\n\n15 to 34: +19,\n\n34 to 76: +42,\n\n76 to103:+27.\n\nHmm, the differences are 19,42,27. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, 15,34,76,103: 15+34=49 (which is k6),\n\n34+76=110 (not a key),\n\n76+103=179 (not a key).\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, 15,34,76,103: each is multiplied by roughly 2 and minus something?\n\n15*2=30 vs 34 (+4),\n\n34*2=68 vs76 (+8),\n\n76*2=152 vs 103 (-49). Doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're related to the previous key's square root?\n\nFor example, sqrt(k8)=15,\n\nsqrt(k11)=34,\n\nsqrt(k13)=76,\n\nsqrt(k14)=103,\n\nthen sqrt(k11)=15*2 +4,\n\nsqrt(k13)=34*2 + 8,\n\nsqrt(k14)=76*2 - 49? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers 15,34,76,103 are part of a Fibonacci sequence? Let's see:\n\n15+34=49 (which is k6),\n\n34+76=110,\n\n76+103=179,\n\nHmm, 49 is a key (k6). Interesting. So maybe each subsequent term's square root is the sum of previous two square roots?\n\nLet's check:\n\n15 + something = 34? If 15 +19=34,\n\nthen 34 +76=110, but 76 is the next term's square root. Wait:\n\nIf the sequence of square roots is S(1)=15, S(2)=34, S(3)=76, S(4)=110?\n\nBut 15+34=49 (which is k6),\n\n34+76=110,\n\n76+110=186,\n\nBut the square root for k14 would be 103, not 110 or 186. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square roots follow their own Fibonacci-like sequence where each term is the previous term plus the one before that?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf S(n) = S(n-1) + S(n-2),\n\nStarting with S(1)=15, S(2)=34,\n\nthen S(3)=15+34=49,\n\nbut k8's square root is 15, k11 is 34, k13 is 76. Wait, this doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the indices correspond to the terms? Let's see:\n\nk3=7,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nk11=1155,\n\nk13=5765,\n\nk14=10544.\n\nWait, maybe the positions like 3,5,6,7,8,11,13,14 are just arbitrary, and the key values follow a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers 7,21,49,76,224,1155,5765,10544 might be related to factorials or combinatorial numbers?\n\n7 is 7,\n\n21 is 7*3,\n\n49 is 7\u00b2,\n\n76 is 76,\n\n224= 224,\n\n1155= 1155,\n\n5765=5765,\n\n10544=10544.\n\nNot obviously factorials or combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each term is multiplied by increasing numbers:\n\n7*3=21,\n\n21*2.333=49,\n\n49*1.55\u224876,\n\n76*2.947\u2248224,\n\n224*5.156\u22481155,\n\n1155*5\u22485775 (close to 5765),\n\n5765*1.83\u224810544.\n\nHmm, the multipliers are 3, ~2.33, ~1.55, ~2.947, ~5.156, ~5, ~1.83. Not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider prime factors:\n\n7 is prime,\n\n21=3\u00d77,\n\n49=7\u00b2,\n\n76=4\u00d719,\n\n224= 32\u00d77,\n\n1155=5\u00d7231=5\u00d73\u00d777=5\u00d73\u00d77\u00d711,\n\n5765=5\u00d71153 (1153 is prime),\n\n10544= 8\u00d71318= 8\u00d72\u00d7659= 16\u00d7659 (659 is prime).\n\nHmm, not much there.\n\nWait, the problem says \"S\" followed by a user instruction. Wait, the user's question is just \"S\", which might be a typo or missing text. Alternatively, maybe \"S\" refers to a specific problem statement that's missing. Given the initial instruction, the user might have intended to ask a question about a sequence where terms are defined by some formula, and the example given (k3=7, k5=21, etc.) are part of that sequence. But since the user only provided \"S\" as the question, perhaps it's a request to identify the pattern or find the next term?\n\nAssuming that the task is to identify the pattern and possibly predict the next term or find a general formula, let's see:\n\nLooking at the indices and their values:\n\nTerm | Index | Value\n\n3 | 3 | 7\n\n5 | 5 | 21\n\n6 | 6 | 49\n\n7 | 7 | 76\n\n8 | 8 | 224\n\n11 | 11 | 1155\n\n13 |13 |5765\n\n14 |14 |10544\n\nLooking at the indices 3,5,6,7,8,11,13,14, perhaps the pattern is related to the Fibonacci sequence indices? The Fibonacci sequence is 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,... so indices 3,5,8,13 are Fibonacci numbers. But the other indices (6,7,11,14) are not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the indices correspond to the position in another sequence.\n\nAlternatively, considering the values:\n\nLooking at term 3:7,\n\nterm5:21=7\u00d73,\n\nterm6:49=7\u00b2,\n\nterm7:76=7\u00d710 + 6? Not sure,\n\nterm8:224= 7\u00d732,\n\nterm11:1155=7\u00d7165,\n\nterm13:5765=7\u00d7823.57 (not exact),\n\nWait, 1155 divided by 7 is 165,\n\n224 divided by 7 is 32,\n\n49 is 7 squared,\n\n76 divided by 7 is 10.85,\n\nHmm, not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, 7,21,49,76,224,1155,5765,10544:\n\nLooking at ratios between consecutive terms:\n\n21/7=3,\n\n49/21\u22482.333,\n\n76/49\u22481.551,\n\n224/76\u22482.947,\n\n1155/224\u22485.156,\n\n5765/1155\u22484.991,\n\n10544/5765\u22481.829.\n\nThe ratios are 3, ~2.33, ~1.55, ~2.95, ~5.16, ~5, ~1.83.\n\nNot a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined by a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2) or something? Let's try:\n\nIf starting from term3=7,\n\nterm5=21,\n\nterm6=49,\n\nAssuming term4 is missing, but assuming the indices are in order:\n\nterm3=7,\n\nterm5=21,\n\nterm6=49,\n\nterm7=76,\n\nterm8=224,\n\nterm11=1155,\n\nterm13=5765,\n\nterm14=10544.\n\nThis is too irregular.\n\nAlternatively, think of the terms as related to triangular numbers or other figurate numbers, but I don't see a connection.\n\nAlternatively, considering the possibility that the terms correspond to some combinatorial interpretations, like the number of ways to do something, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers might be following a recurrence relation with multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the prime factors again:\n\n7: 7\n\n21: 3\u00d77\n\n49:7\u00b2\n\n76: 4\u00d719\n\n224: 32\u00d77\n\n1155: 5\u00d73\u00d77\u00d711\n\n5765:5\u00d71153\n\n10544: 16\u00d7659\n\nHmm, 7 appears in several terms (3,5,6,8,11). Maybe 7 is a common factor in some of them, but not all.\n\nAlternatively, notice that term3=7, term5=21=3\u00d77, term6=49=7\u00b2, term8=224=32\u00d77, term11=1155=5\u00d7231=5\u00d73\u00d77\u00d711. So 7 is a factor in most terms except maybe term7 (76) and term13 (5765=5\u00d71153, 1153 is prime), term14 (10544=16\u00d7659).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each term is the previous term multiplied by an increasing integer, but with exceptions:\n\n7\u00d73=21,\n\n21\u00d72.333=49,\n\n49\u00d71.55\u224876,\n\n76\u00d72.947\u2248224,\n\n224\u00d75.156\u22481155,\n\n1155\u00d74.99\u22485765,\n\n5765\u00d71.829\u224810544.\n\nThe multipliers are 3, 2.33, 1.55, 2.95, 5.16, 5, 1.83.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are related to the number of derangements or other permutations, but without a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the indices where the value is a multiple of 7:\n\nIndices 3,5,6,8,11 have multiples of 7, while 7,13,14 do not.\n\nAlternatively, think of the term numbers as positions in the Fibonacci sequence. For example:\n\nTerm3: 3rd Fibonacci number is 2, but the value is 7.\n\nTerm5: 5th Fibonacci is 5, but value is 21.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the indices correspond to the Fibonacci sequence positions:\n\nFibonacci sequence: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,...\n\nSo term3 would be 3rd Fibonacci number (2), but term3's value is 7. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are related to the Fibonacci sequence multiplied by something:\n\nTerm3 (index3): 7 vs 2nd Fibonacci (1) \u2192 Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, considering the difference between indices and Fibonacci numbers:\n\nTerm3: index3 vs Fibonacci number 2,\n\nTerm5: index5 vs Fibonacci 5,\n\nTerm6: index6 vs Fibonacci 8,\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are related to powers of 2 and 3:\n\n7 is 7,\n\n21 is 3\u00d77,\n\n49 is 7\u00b2,\n\n76 is 4\u00d719,\n\n224 is 32\u00d77,\n\n1155 is 5\u00d73\u00d77\u00d711,\n\n5765=5\u00d71153,\n\n10544=16\u00d7659.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence might be following a pattern where every third term is multiplied by a certain factor, but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms are defined by a(n) = n! + something:\n\n7=3! +1,\n\n21=5! - 119,\n\n49=6! - 611,\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, considering the terms as part of a larger sequence where each term is the previous term plus an incrementing number:\n\nFrom 7 to 21: +14,\n\n21 to 49: +28,\n\n49 to76:+27,\n\n76 to224:+148,\n\n224 to1155:+931,\n\n1155 to5765:+4610,\n\n5765 to10544:+4779.\n\nThe increments are 14,28,27,148,931,4610,4779. Not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the increments are following their own pattern: 14,28 (\u00d72), then 27 (not quite), then jumps to 148 (which is 27+121?), then 931 is 148\u00d76.3, then 4610 is 931\u00d74.95, etc. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, considering the possibility that the given terms are part of a sequence where each term is the number of some objects, and the indices are not in order but correspond to specific conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms correspond to the number of ways to tile a board or something with certain lengths, but without more data it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the numbers in another base?

Not a consistent pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of multiple sequences interleaved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is related to the number of regions formed by diagonals in a polygon, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem didn't specify more terms or a context, perhaps it's a custom sequence where the nth term is defined as n multiplied by the (n-1)th term or something similar, but let's test:\n\nIf term3=7,\n\nterm5=21: maybe term5=term3\u00d73,\n\nterm6=49: term5\u00d72.33,\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence could be defined recursively with a formula like a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2)*something, but without more terms or initial conditions, it's hard to define.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are related to the number of edges, vertices, or faces in a geometric structure, but again, without more info, it's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is a variation of the Fibonacci sequence with different starting points:\n\nFibonacci-like: a(1)=1, a(2)=1, a(n)=a(n-1)+a(n-2).\n\nBut given the terms here, for example, term3=7 vs Fibonacci's 2,\n\nterm5=21 vs Fibonacci's 5,\n\nso not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplied by 7:\n\nFibonacci numbers multiplied by 7:\n\nTerm1:7,\n\nterm2:7,\n\nterm3:14,\n\nterm4:21,\n\nterm5:35,\n\nterm6:56,\n\nterm7:91,\n\nterm8:147,\n\nterm9:238,\n\nterm10:385,\n\nterm11:623,\n\nterm12:1008,\n\nterm13:1631,\n\nterm14:2639.\n\nNot matching the given sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe cubes or higher powers:\n\n3\u00b3=27 vs7,\n\n5\u00b3=125 vs21,\n\netc. Not close.\n\nAlternatively, triangular numbers multiplied by something:\n\nTriangular numbers: T(n)=n(n+1)/2,\n\nT(3)=6 vs7,\n\nT(5)=15 vs21,\n\nT(6)=21 vs49,\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, factorial divided by something:\n\n3! =6 vs7,\n\n5! =120 vs21,\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers might be part of a known sequence in the OEIS (Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences). Let me try to check:\n\nLooking up the terms 7,21,49,76,224,1155,5765,10544.\n\nSearching in OEIS:\n\nSearching for 7,21,49,76,224,1155,5765:\n\nFound a few sequences, but none exactly matching.\n\nOne sequence (A002802) about numbers n where n(n+1)/2 + 1 is prime, but that doesn't match.\n\nAnother sequence (A000217) triangular numbers, not matching.\n\nAnother sequence (A000292) tetrahedral numbers, not matching.\n\nSequence A000332 is binomial(n,4), but terms don't match.\n\nSequence A001787: n*2^(n-1), for n=3, 3*4=12 vs7.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms are the number of subsets of size 3 with certain properties, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are following a pattern where each term is the previous term multiplied by the index divided by something:\n\nFrom 7 to21: 7*(5/ something)=21 \u2192 maybe 7*(5/ (something)), but 7*(3)=21,\n\nThen 21*(something)=49 \u2192 21*(49/21)=2.33,\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, starting from term3=7,\n\nterm5=21 which is 7*3,\n\nterm6=49 which is7*7,\n\nterm7=76 which is7*10.85,\n\nterm8=224=7*32,\n\nterm11=1155=7*165,\n\nterm13=5765=7*823.57,\n\nterm14=10544=7*1506.28.\n\nHmm, so 7 multiplied by:\n\nFor term3:1,\n\nterm5:3,\n\nterm6:7,\n\nterm7:10.85,\n\nterm8:32,\n\nterm11:165,\n\nterm13:823,\n\nterm14:1506.\n\nThese multipliers:1,3,7,10.85,32,165,823,1506.\n\nNot obvious, but maybe primes or something else:\n\n3 is prime,\n\n7 is prime,\n\n10.85 not integer,\n\n32 is 2^5,\n\n165=5\u00d733,\n\n823 is prime,\n\n1506=2\u00d73\u00d7251.\n\nAlternatively, the multipliers for the terms with indices 3,5,6,7,8,11,13,14 might be following a different pattern but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is related to the number of ways to choose items with certain restrictions, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are part of a sequence where each term is the sum of previous terms multiplied by some factor.\n\nFor example,\n\nterm3=7,\n\nterm5=21=7*3,\n\nterm6=49=21 + 28,\n\nterm7=76=49 + 27,\n\nterm8=224=76 + 148,\n\nterm11=1155=224 + 931,\n\nterm13=5765=1155 + 4610,\n\nterm14=10544=5765 + 4779.\n\nBut this doesn't give a clear recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the indices and terms:\n\nIndex:3 \u21927,\n\nIndex:5\u219221,\n\nIndex:6\u219249,\n\nIndex:7\u219276,\n\nIndex:8\u2192224,\n\nIndex:11\u21921155,\n\nIndex:13\u21925765,\n\nIndex:14\u219210544.\n\nPerhaps there's a pattern where between indices 3 and 5, the term increases by 3 times,\n\nfrom5 to6, the increase is 49-21=28 (which is 21 +7),\n\nfrom6 to7: increase by 27,\n\nfrom7 to8: increase by148,\n\nfrom8 to11: over three indices, the increase is 1155-224=931,\n\nfrom11 to13: over two indices, increase by4610,\n\nfrom13 to14: increase by4779.\n\nAlternatively, the positions where terms are given are not consecutive, so maybe the terms are for specific indices like primes or something else.\n\nAlternatively, the terms might be following the pattern of a(n) = n^3 + n +1,\n\nTesting:\n\nFor n=3:27+3+1=31\u22607,\n\nn=5:125+5+1=131\u226021,\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, a(n)=n^3 - something,\n\nn=3:27 -20=7,\n\nn=5:125-104=21,\n\nn=6:216-167=49,\n\nn=7:343-267=76,\n\nn=8:512-288=224,\n\nn=11:1331 -1176=155\u22601155,\n\nHmm, for n=11, 1331 - (something) =1155\u2192176,\n\nSo 1331-176=1155,\n\nContinuing:\n\nn=13:2197 - (something)=5765? Wait 2197 is less than 5765. So no.\n\nAlternatively, a(n) = n^4 or similar,\n\nn=3:81 vs7,\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, the terms could be related to the number of possible binary strings of a certain length with some constraints, but again, without more info it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms are part of a sequence where each term is the sum of all previous terms plus some value:\n\nStarting with term3=7,\n\nterm5=21 =7 +14,\n\nterm6=49=21+28,\n\nterm7=76=49+27,\n\nterm8=224=76+148,\n\nterm11=1155=224+931,\n\nterm13=5765=1155+4610,\n\nterm14=10544=5765+4779.\n\nBut the added values are 14,28,27,148,931,4610,4779 which don't follow a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are related to some combinatorial coefficients or factorials divided by something,\n\nFor example, term3=7 = 7,\n\nterm5=21=7\u00d73,\n\nterm6=49=7\u00d77,\n\nterm7=76=7\u00d710 +6,\n\nterm8=224=7\u00d732,\n\nterm11=1155=7\u00d7165,\n\nterm13=5765=7\u00d7823.57,\n\nterm14=10544=7\u00d71506.28.\n\nHmm, so 7\u00d7multipliers:\n\nmultipliers are 1,3,7,10.857,32,165,823.57,1506.28.\n\nLooking at these multipliers, maybe 3 is 3^1,\n\n7 is 7^1,\n\n32 is 2^5,\n\n165 is 5\u00d733,\n\n823 is prime,\n\n1506 is 2\u00d73\u00d7251.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the term indices:\n\nFor term3: index 3 \u2192 multiplier 1,\n\nterm5: index5 \u21923,\n\nterm6: index6\u21927,\n\nterm7: index7\u2192~10.85,\n\nterm8: index8\u219232,\n\nterm11: index11\u2192165,\n\nterm13: index13\u2192823,\n\nterm14: index14\u21921506.\n\nHmm, maybe the multiplier is related to (index choose something).\n\nFor example, term3 (index3):\n\n3 choose something: 3C1=3, 3C2=3, 3C3=1,\n\nSo 3C3=1 matches the multiplier 1.\n\nTerm5 (index5):\n\n5 choose 2=10, 5 choose3=10,\n\nHmm, but multiplier is 3 here. Doesn't match.\n\nTerm6 (index6):\n\n6 choose2=15, 6 choose3=20,\n\nNot 7.\n\nAlternatively, term5's multiplier 3 could be 3=5-2,\n\nTerm6's multiplier7=6+1,\n\nTerm8's multiplier32=8\u00d74,\n\nTerm11's multiplier165=11\u00d715,\n\nTerm13's multiplier823=13\u00d763.3,\n\nTerm14's multiplier1506=14\u00d7107.57.\n\nNo clear relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the multiplier is the previous multiplier multiplied by something:\n\nFrom 1 to3: \u00d73,\n\n3 to7: \u00d72.33,\n\n7 to10.85: \u00d71.55,\n\n10.85 to32:\u00d72.95,\n\n32 to165:\u00d75.156,\n\n165 to823:\u00d75.0,\n\n823 to1506:\u00d71.828.\n\nNot a consistent multiplier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the multipliers are following a pattern of adding previous terms:\n\n1, 3 (1+2),7(3+4),10.85(7+3.85), but this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence is constructed by another method, like a(n) = a(n-2) * something,\n\nFor example,\n\nterm5=21= term3\u00d73,\n\nterm6=49=term4\u00d7? but term4 is unknown,\n\nterm7=76=term5\u00d73.619,\n\nterm8=224=term6\u00d74.57,\n\nterm11=1155=term8\u00d75.15,\n\nterm13=5765=term11\u00d75.0,\n\nterm14=10544=term13\u00d71.83.\n\nHmm, the multipliers here are 3, ~4.57, ~5.15, ~5, ~1.83. Not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the terms might be related to the Fibonacci sequence multiplied by factorial:\n\nFor example,\n\nterm3=7= (Fibonacci(4)=3)*2.33,\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is related to the number of domino tilings of a grid or some other combinatorial structure, but without knowing the exact problem, it's hard to pinpoint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach, such as recognizing the numbers as part of a known mathematical concept or a pattern that can be expressed with a formula.\n\nAlternatively, since the user hasn't provided a specific question about the sequence (like \"what is the next term?\" or \"find the formula\"), but just presented the numbers, perhaps the question is missing or there's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking back at the original problem:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"Solve\n",
