  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to tackle this problem. So, the user is asking if there's a connection between the given ratios of these k terms and the golden ratio (phi) or Fibonacci numbers. The golden ratio is approximately 1.618, and its square is about 2.618. They provided some specific ratios between the k terms and mentioned that some are close to phi or phi squared. Let me go step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list out the given k terms and their ratios. The initial ratios given are:\n\n- k8/k7 = 224/76 \u2248 2.947 (not close to phi)\n- k7/k6 = 76/49 \u2248 1.551 (close to phi)\n- k6/k5 = 49/21 \u2248 2.333\n- k5/k4 = 21/8 = 2.625 (close to phi squared)\n- k4/k3 = 8/7 \u2248 1.143\n- k3/k2 = 7/3 \u2248 2.333\n\nThey also mention checking the later terms:\n- k14/k13 \u2248 10544/5765 \u2248 1.829\n- k13/k12 \u2248 5765/2683 \u2248 2.148\n- k12/k11 \u2248 2683/1155 \u2248 2.323\n\nThe user noticed that k7/k6 is about 1.55, which is close to phi (1.618), and k5/k4 is 2.625, which is very close to phi squared (2.618). That seems significant. Maybe there's a pattern here?\n\nFirst, let's recall that the Fibonacci sequence is defined by F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, etc. The ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches phi as n increases. So, if some of these k terms are Fibonacci numbers, their ratios might approach phi.\n\nLooking at the given ratios:\n\nk7/k6 \u2248 1.551. Let's see what Fibonacci numbers have ratios around that. Let me check some Fibonacci ratios:\n\nF(8)/F(7) = 21/13 \u2248 1.615 (close to phi)\nF(7)/F(6) = 13/8 = 1.625 (also close)\nHmm, so maybe k7 and k6 are Fibonacci numbers? Let me check the actual numbers.\n\nGiven k7 is 76 and k6 is 49. But 76 and 49 aren't Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci numbers around that area: F(11)=89, F(10)=55, F(9)=34, F(8)=21, F(7)=13, F(6)=8. Wait, so 49 isn't a Fibonacci number. Maybe the k terms aren't exactly Fibonacci numbers, but their ratios are approaching phi?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence of k terms is a different recurrence relation but still relates to phi. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the ratios:\n\nk5/k4 = 21/8 = 2.625. Phi squared is about 2.618, which is very close. So that's a strong hint. Similarly, k7/k6 is close to phi. The user also mentions that k5/k4 is close to phi squared. So maybe there's a pattern where every other ratio is close to phi or phi squared?\n\nWait, let's see the ratios again:\n\nk8/k7 \u2248 2.947 (not close to anything here)\nk7/k6 \u22481.551 (near phi)\nk6/k5 \u22482.333 (Not close to phi or phi squared)\nk5/k4 \u22482.625 (close to phi\u00b2)\nk4/k3\u22481.143 (not close)\nk3/k2\u22482.333 (same as above)\n\nHmm, maybe the even and odd terms? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratios alternate between something near phi and phi squared? Not exactly, but the closest ones are k7/k6 and k5/k4. Let me see if the ratios before and after these follow a pattern.\n\nWait, the user also provided some later terms: k14/k13\u22481.829, k13/k12\u22482.148, k12/k11\u22482.323. Let me see these. Let me compute those numbers more precisely:\n\nFirst, let me compute k14/k13 = 10544 / 5765. Let me do this division: 10544 \u00f7 5765. Let's see:\n\n5765*1.8 = 5765*1 + 5765*0.8 = 5765 + 4612 = 10377. That's close to 10544. The difference is 10544 - 10377 = 167. So 1.8 + 167/5765 \u2248 1.8 + 0.029 \u2248 1.829. So that's accurate.\n\nSimilarly, k13/k12 = 5765 / 2683. Let me see: 2683*2 = 5366, so 5765 - 5366 = 399. So that's 2 + 399/2683 \u2248 2 + 0.149 \u2248 2.149. Close to 2.148.\n\nk12/k11 = 2683 / 1155. Let me calculate that: 1155*2 = 2310, so 2683 - 2310 = 373, so that's 2 + 373/1155 \u2248 2 + 0.323 \u2248 2.323. So those are precise.\n\nNow, looking at these later ratios:\n\nk14/k13 \u22481.829. Phi is ~1.618, so this is higher. Not exactly phi, but maybe related?\n\nk13/k12 \u22482.148. Phi squared is ~2.618, so this is less than that.\n\nk12/k11\u22482.323. Still less than phi squared.\n\nHmm, perhaps these later ratios are approaching something else? Not sure yet.\n\nLet me see if the k terms follow a Fibonacci-like recurrence. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the k terms follow a linear recurrence. Let me check if the ratios suggest a possible recurrence.\n\nFirst, let's list the k terms from the given ratios. The user didn't list all k terms, but we can reconstruct some of them based on the given ratios.\n\nStarting from k2:\n\nWe have k3/k2 = 7/3 \u22482.333, so if k2 is 3, then k3=7.\n\nk4/k3=8/7\u22481.142, so if k3=7, then k4=8.\n\nk5/k4=21/8\u22482.625, so k5=21.\n\nk6/k5=49/21\u22482.333, so k6=49.\n\nk7/k6=76/49\u22481.551, so k7=76.\n\nk8/k7=224/76\u22482.947, so k8=224.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check:\n\nWait, the given ratios are:\n\nk8/k7 = 224/76. Wait, so k8 is 224, k7 is 76.\n\nk7/k6 =76/49, so k6 is 49.\n\nk6/k5=49/21, so k5=21.\n\nk5/k4=21/8, so k4=8.\n\nk4/k3=8/7, so k3=7.\n\nk3/k2=7/3, so k2=3.\n\nSo working backwards, starting from k2=3:\n\nk2 =3,\n\nk3=7,\n\nk4=8,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nBut then the user also provided terms up to k14:\n\nk11, k12, k13, k14.\n\nGiven that k12/k11 \u22482.323, so let's see:\n\nIf we continue the sequence beyond k8=224, we can try to see if there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the later terms (k11 to k14) follow a different pattern? The user just gave those ratios, so perhaps we can assume that the sequence continues beyond k8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire sequence is a Fibonacci-like sequence with some different recurrence relation?\n\nLet me try to see if the first few terms follow a linear recurrence.\n\nGiven the terms:\n\nk2=3,\n\nk3=7,\n\nk4=8,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nSuppose it's a second-order linear recurrence: k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2}\n\nLet me try to find a and b.\n\nUsing k3=7, k2=3, k1 must be something. Wait, but we don't have k1. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting from k2:\n\nLet me assume that the recurrence starts from k2. Let me see:\n\nWe have k3=7, k2=3,\n\nk4=8 = a*7 + b*3,\n\nk5=21 = a*8 + b*7,\n\nSo two equations:\n\n7a + 3b =8,\n\n8a +7b =21.\n\nLet me solve these equations.\n\nMultiply first equation by 8: 56a +24b =64,\n\nMultiply second equation by7:56a +49b =147,\n\nSubtract first from second: 25b =83 \u21d2 b =83/25=3.32\n\nHmm, that's a non-integer. Maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different order?\n\nWait, maybe third-order recurrence? Because with the given terms, maybe more variables. This could get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratios alternate between something?\n\nLooking at the first few terms:\n\nk2=3,\n\nk3=7,\n\nk4=8,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nLooking at the progression: 3,7,8,21,49,76,224.\n\nLooking for a pattern here. Let's see:\n\nFrom 3 to7: +4,\n\n7 to8: +1,\n\n8 to21:+13,\n\n21 to49:+28,\n\n49 to76:+27,\n\n76 to224:+148,\n\nHmm, the increments are 4,1,13,28,27,148. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, multiplying factors:\n\n7/3\u22482.333,\n\n8/7\u22481.142,\n\n21/8\u22482.625,\n\n49/21\u22482.333,\n\n76/49\u22481.551,\n\n224/76\u22482.947,\n\nSo the ratios alternate between ~2.333 and lower numbers?\n\nWait, the ratios alternate between higher and lower? Let me list them again:\n\nk3/k2 \u22482.333,\n\nk4/k3\u22481.142,\n\nk5/k4\u22482.625,\n\nk6/k5\u22482.333,\n\nk7/k6\u22481.551,\n\nk8/k7\u22482.947,\n\nHmm, so the ratios go up and down but maybe following some pattern?\n\nLooking at the ratios:\n\nFirst ratio (k3/k2)=2.333,\n\nThen k4/k3=1.142,\n\nk5/k4=2.625,\n\nk6/k5=2.333,\n\nk7/k6=1.551,\n\nk8/k7\u22482.947,\n\nHmm, maybe if we look at every other ratio?\n\nLooking at the odd steps:\n\nk3/k2\u22482.333,\n\nk5/k4\u22482.625,\n\nk7/k6\u22481.551,\n\nk9/k8 would be next? Hmm, but we don't have k9.\n\nWait, maybe the even steps?\n\nk4/k3\u22481.142,\n\nk6/k5\u22482.333,\n\nk8/k7\u22482.947,\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms follow a modified Fibonacci rule where each term is the sum of previous terms in some way?\n\nLet me see:\n\nk5=21. Let's see: 8 (k4) + 13 (from somewhere?) Hmm, 8 + 13=21. Wait, 13 is k3?\n\nWait k3 is 7. Hmm, no. Alternatively, 21 could be k4 (8) + k3 (7) + something? Not sure.\n\nWait, k6=49. Let's see: 21 (k5) + 28? Not sure. 21 + 28 =49, but where does 28 come from? Maybe previous terms?\n\nAlternatively, 21 (k5) + 28 (which is 21 +7?), but this is getting convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are related to Fibonacci numbers multiplied by some factor?\n\nLooking at the values:\n\nk2=3,\n\nk3=7,\n\nk4=8,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nFibonacci numbers around this area are:\n\nF(6)=8,\n\nF(7)=13,\n\nF(8)=21,\n\nF(9)=34,\n\nF(10)=55,\n\nF(11)=89,\n\nF(12)=144,\n\nF(13)=233,\n\nF(14)=377,\n\nF(15)=610,\n\nHmm, so k5=21 is exactly F(8). k4=8 is F(6). k3=7 is close to F(6)=8, but not exact. k2=3, F(4)=3, so k2=F(4).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nk2=3=F(4),\n\nk3=7: F(6)=8, so close,\n\nk4=8=F(6),\n\nk5=21=F(8),\n\nk6=49: Hmm, F(9)=34, F(10)=55. 49 is between them,\n\nk7=76: F(11)=89, so close,\n\nk8=224: F(12)=144, F(13)=233, so 224 is between F(12) and F(13).\n\nHmm, maybe the terms are Fibonacci numbers offset by some indices?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are the Fibonacci numbers multiplied by some factors?\n\nLet me see:\n\nk2=3=F(4),\n\nk3=7: Let's see, 7 is F(6) -1,\n\nk4=8=F(6),\n\nk5=21=F(8),\n\nk6=49: F(10)=55-6,\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, k6=49 is 7 squared. 7 is k3. Hmm, maybe?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each term is a combination of previous terms?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the later terms given (k11 to k14):\n\nThey provided ratios:\n\nk14/k13\u22481.829,\n\nk13/k12\u22482.148,\n\nk12/k11\u22482.323,\n\nThese ratios are still not exactly phi or phi squared, but maybe approaching something?\n\nWait, let me compute the exact values:\n\nk14/k13 =10544/5765 \u22481.829,\n\nk13/k12=5765/2683\u22482.148,\n\nk12/k11=2683/1155\u22482.323.\n\nIf we consider continued ratios, maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these terms follow a different recurrence relation, like a second order linear recurrence with constant coefficients?\n\nSuppose for terms from k11 to k14, we can set up equations:\n\nLet me suppose that starting from some term, the recurrence is k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2},\n\nThen using k12, k13, k14:\n\nk14 = a*k13 +b*k12,\n\nk13 = a*k12 +b*k11,\n\nBut without knowing k11's value, it's hard to solve.\n\nAlternatively, approximate:\n\nLet me see:\n\nk12/k11\u22482.323 \u21d2k12\u22482.323*k11,\n\nk13\u22482.148*k12\u22482.148*(2.323*k11)=2.148*2.323*k11\u22485.003*k11,\n\nk14\u22481.829*k13\u22481.829*(5.003*k11)\u22489.149*k11,\n\nBut then k14/k11\u22489.149,\n\nBut k14 is 10544, and k11 is 1155,\n\n10544/1155\u22489.129,\n\nWhich matches roughly, so that works.\n\nThus, the ratio from k11 to k14 is roughly 9.129 over 3 steps,\n\nSo the multiplier per step would be cube root of 9.129\u22482.09 per step,\n\nSo maybe the later terms are growing by a factor of ~2.1 each time,\n\nBut not sure how that relates to earlier terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire sequence is a Fibonacci-type sequence with a different starting point?\n\nWait, let me think of another approach.\n\nThe user mentioned \"G\" and \"F\" in the problem statement? No, actually, the user just presented the problem as:\n\n\"G\n\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nWait, perhaps \"G\" is part of the problem? Maybe the user made a typo or formatting error?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original problem was in Chinese, and \"G\" is a misrendered character? For example, sometimes \"G\" could be \"\u4f60\" or another character, but without more context, hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the next term in the sequence given the ratios?\n\nWait, the problem as presented is just \"G\" followed by instructions. Maybe the actual problem was lost in translation or formatting?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a problem from a Chinese platform where \"G\" is an identifier?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to present a problem but only the letter G remained?\n\nGiven the context, perhaps the actual problem is to find the next term in the sequence provided, with the terms up to k8=224, and the later terms given up to k14=10544, and the task is to find the next term or identify the pattern related to the golden ratio (phi) since the user mentioned \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" and the initial thought about phi?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the value of G, which could be the golden ratio, approximately 1.618, but given the context of the sequence provided, maybe the limit of the ratios?\n\nLooking at the ratios of consecutive terms in the initial sequence:\n\nk3/k2\u22482.333,\n\nk4/k3\u22481.142,\n\nk5/k4\u22482.625,\n\nk6/k5\u22482.333,\n\nk7/k6\u22481.551,\n\nk8/k7\u22482.947,\n\nk9 would be next? But we don't have it.\n\nLooking at the later terms:\n\nk12/k11\u22482.323,\n\nk13/k12\u22482.148,\n\nk14/k13\u22481.829,\n\nHmm, these later ratios are decreasing from ~2.323 to ~2.148 to ~1.829.\n\nIt seems inconsistent with the golden ratio, which is about 1.618, so maybe not directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem was to find a missing term in the sequence, but without more data, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is to find the value of G, which is the limit of the ratio of consecutive terms as n approaches infinity?\n\nLooking at the later terms, the ratio is approaching around 2? Let's see:\n\nFrom k11 to k14:\n\nk12/k11\u22482.323,\n\nk13/k12\u22482.148,\n\nk14/k13\u22481.829,\n\nIt's decreasing, so maybe approaching 1.618? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's approaching 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence follows a second order linear recurrence where the ratio converges to a particular value.\n\nSuppose the recurrence is k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2},\n\nIf the ratio r = k_n / k_{n-1} approaches a limit, then in the limit,\n\nr = (a*r + b)/r,\n\nSo r^2 = a*r + b,\n\nThus, the characteristic equation is r^2 - a*r - b =0,\n\nThe roots would be [a \u00b1 sqrt(a\u00b2 +4b)]/2,\n\nIf the ratio converges to one of the roots.\n\nSuppose we consider the later terms where the ratios are approaching a limit.\n\nLooking at the last few ratios:\n\nk14/k13\u22481.829,\n\nIf we suppose that this is approaching a limit r,\n\nThen using the previous ratio k13/k12\u22482.148,\n\nAssuming the recurrence is k_n = r*k_{n-1} + something,\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the golden ratio in the sequence?\n\nAlternatively, given the user's mention of \"step by step\" and putting the answer in a box, maybe the question is to compute the next term in the sequence provided?\n\nThe user provided up to k14=10544, but let's see:\n\nGiven the terms:\n\nk2=3,\n\nk3=7,\n\nk4=8,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nk9=?\n\nk10=?\n\nk11=1155,\n\nWait, actually, in the later terms given:\n\nk12/k11\u22482.323,\n\nSo if k11 is 1155,\n\nthen k12 \u22481155*2.323\u22482683. So that matches the given k12=2683,\n\nSimilarly k13\u22482683*2.148\u22485765,\n\nk14\u22485765*1.829\u224810544,\n\nSo proceeding similarly, if we wanted to find k15,\n\nwe could compute k15\u224810544 * (next ratio),\n\nbut since the ratios are decreasing, perhaps we need to see the pattern of the ratios themselves.\n\nThe ratios between terms from k11 to k14 are:\n\n2.323, 2.148, 1.829,\n\nThe differences between these ratios:\n\n2.148 -2.323\u2248-0.175,\n\n1.829 -2.148\u2248-0.319,\n\nSo decreasing by about 0.175 and 0.319,\n\nNot a clear pattern, but maybe the next ratio is decreasing further?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is approaching the golden ratio?\n\nBut 1.618 is less than the last ratio of 1.829,\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to notice that some ratio is close to the golden ratio.\n\nLooking back at earlier ratios:\n\nk5/k4=21/8\u22482.625,\n\nk7/k6\u22481.551,\n\nk8/k7\u22482.947,\n\nHmm, 1.551 is somewhat close to phi\u22481.618,\n\nk7/k6\u22481.551 which is close to phi,\n\nSimilarly, k5/k4\u22482.625 is roughly phi squared (\u22482.618),\n\nAh, phi squared is approximately 2.618,\n\nWhich is very close to 2.625,\n\nSimilarly, phi is approximately 1.618,\n\nWhich is close to 1.551 (k7/k6) and 1.829 (k14/k13).\n\nWait, so maybe the terms are following a pattern where every other term's ratio relates to phi squared or phi?\n\nLooking at k5/k4\u22482.625 \u2248 phi\u00b2\u22482.618,\n\nSimilarly, k7/k6\u22481.551 which is near phi,\n\nk3/k2\u22482.333, which is higher than phi squared,\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is a Fibonacci sequence starting from different initial terms?\n\nLet me try:\n\nIf we have a Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 3 and 7,\n\nthen:\n\nk1=3,\n\nk2=7,\n\nk3=k1 +k2=10,\n\nbut that's not matching the given k3=8,\n\nAlternatively, different recurrence,\n\nSuppose k_n = k_{n-1} + k_{n-2},\n\nBut starting with 3 and 7,\n\nk3=10, which doesn't match the given 8,\n\nAlternatively, maybe a different recurrence relation,\n\nSuppose k_n = 2*k_{n-1} - k_{n-2},\n\nTesting:\n\nk3=2*7-3=11, not 8,\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k_n = k_{n-1} + 2*k_{n-2},\n\nThen k3=7 +2*3=13, not 8,\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, k_n = k_{n-2} * something,\n\nk3=8, which is 3* something plus 7?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the given terms:\n\nTerm numbers and values:\n\nTerm 2: 3,\n\nTerm3:7,\n\nTerm4:8,\n\nTerm5:21,\n\nTerm6:49,\n\nTerm7:76,\n\nTerm8:224,\n\nTerm11:1155,\n\nTerm12:2683,\n\nTerm13:5765,\n\nTerm14:10544,\n\nLooking for a possible pattern or a generating formula.\n\nAlternatively, check if these numbers relate to combinatorial numbers or other sequences.\n\nLooking up the sequence 3,7,8,21,49,76,224,1155,2683,5765,10544 in OEIS,\n\nBut since I can't access external resources, I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, see if the sequence can be expressed as a combination of Fibonacci and something else.\n\nAlternatively, notice that the terms from k5 onward seem to be multiples or combinations of previous terms.\n\nFor instance:\n\nk5=21,\n\nIf k5 = k4 + k3 =8+7=15, which is not 21,\n\nAlternatively, k5= k4 *3: 8*3=24 no,\n\nAlternatively, k5= 21, which is 3*7,\n\nHmm, product of first two terms,\n\nk6=49, which is 7*7,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nHmm, 3,7,8,21,49,76,224,1155,...\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of the problem possibly being about the golden ratio, given the user mentioned \"step by step\" and the box for the answer.\n\nIf the question is to find the limit of the ratio of consecutive terms as n approaches infinity, assuming it converges,\n\nLooking at the later terms:\n\nk12/k11 \u22482.323,\n\nk13/k12\u22482.148,\n\nk14/k13\u22481.829,\n\nThe ratios are decreasing, so maybe approaching a value,\n\nBut without more terms, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be to find the value of G, which is the golden ratio, and the context is a trick question where the answer is simply phi.\n\nAlternatively, given the terms provided, maybe the question is to compute a specific term using the ratios provided, but without more info, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the next term after 10544,\n\nAssuming the pattern of ratios continues decreasing by roughly the same decrement,\n\nThe last three ratios were:\n\n2.323, 2.148, 1.829,\n\nThe differences between them are -0.175, -0.319,\n\nIf the next difference is roughly -0.45 or something,\n\nThen the next ratio would be 1.829 -0.45\u22481.379,\n\nThus k15\u224810544 *1.379\u224814580,\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, if the ratio is approaching the golden ratio 1.618,\n\nThen assuming the next ratio is 1.618,\n\nk15\u224810544*1.618\u224817030,\n\nBut this is also guesswork.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence follows a second-order linear recurrence,\n\nLet me suppose that from term 5 onward, there is a linear recurrence.\n\nLet me try with terms from k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224,\n\nAssume k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2}\n\nFor n=7: 76 =a*49 + b*21,\n\nFor n=8:224= a*76 + b*49,\n\nSo,\n\nEquation1:49a +21b=76,\n\nEquation2:76a +49b=224,\n\nLet me solve these equations,\n\nMultiply Equation1 by 49: 49*49a +49*21b =49*76,\n\nMultiply Equation2 by21:21*76a +21*49b=21*224,\n\nSubtract,\n\n(49\u00b2 -21*76)a = 49*76 -21*224,\n\nCalculate coefficients,\n\nFirst, compute 49\u00b2 =2401,\n\n21*76=1596,\n\nThus, left side:2401 -1596=805,\n\nRight side:49*76=3724; 21*224=4704,\n\nThus 3724 -4704= -980,\n\nSo 805a =-980 \u21d2a= -980/805 \u2248-1.217,\n\nThis gives a negative coefficient which might not make sense for the sequence's growth,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps different terms,\n\nMaybe starting from an earlier point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recurrence is multiplicative.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be to find the 7th term or something, but given the terms provided up to k14, maybe the question is to find the value of G, which is the golden ratio, as the problem's context hints at it.\n\nAlternatively, given the user's initial instruction and the mention of \"step by step\", the problem might be to compute the golden ratio, which is (1 + sqrt(5))/2 \u22481.618,\n\nThus, the final answer is the golden ratio, boxed as \\boxed{\\dfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}}.\n\nBut since the problem isn't clearly stated, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to find the next term after 10544 using the last ratio:\n\nk14/k13\u224810544/5765\u22481.829,\n\nIf we assume the ratio continues decreasing by similar decrement,\n\nThe last three ratios' differences were:\n\nFrom 2.323 to2.148: -0.175,\n\nFrom2.148 to1.829: -0.319,\n\nThe difference of the differences is -0.144,\n\nIf we assume the next difference decreases by another ~-0.144,\n\nThe next ratio would decrease by -0.319 -0.144\u2248-0.463,\n\nThus next ratio\u22481.829 -0.463\u22481.366,\n\nThen k15\u224810544 *1.366\u224814428,\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to recognize that the terms after k8 jump to 1155, which might be part of a different recurrence.\n\nLooking at k8=224 and k11=1155,\n\nThe ratio from k8 to k11 over three steps,\n\n1155/224\u22485.156,\n\nSo average ratio per step\u2248cube root(5.156)\u22481.73,\n\nSimilarly from k11 to k14:10544/1155\u22489.129 over three steps,\n\ncube root(9.129)\u22482.09,\n\nHmm, so the growth factor is increasing then decreasing?\n\nThis inconsistency makes it hard to see a pattern.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and the mention of the golden ratio in the thought process, I'll assume the problem requires the golden ratio, so the answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}}.\n\nBut since the problem might have been about the sequence provided and the next term, but without clear problem statement, it's hard to be sure.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the question is in Chinese and the user provided the problem code \"G\", and it's a standard problem where the answer is the golden ratio.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be: Given the sequence defined by a certain recurrence relation, find the limit of the ratio of consecutive terms, which is the golden ratio.\n\nSince the user mentioned \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{},\" and given the context of ratios close to phi, it's plausible the answer is the golden ratio.\n\nThus, I will go with \\boxed{\\dfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}}.\n",
