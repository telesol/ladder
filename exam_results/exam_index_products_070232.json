There are several observations:\n- They mention indices and observed formulas.\n\nThe data provided:\n\nObservations:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHypothesis: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nThen they check for some keys:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo they conclude: k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711.\n\nI need to \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" The question is ambiguous, but it likely means that there's a sequence where some keys k_n are computed using the formula: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). And they want to compute f(n) values for keys (n being index), maybe based on the provided keys.\n\nThe given keys might be part of a known sequence, perhaps the \"Index Product Pattern Analysis\" problem. Possibly these keys correspond to some puzzle or riddle? They mention indices and product patterns. The observed ones: k5 = k2 * k3, but then they say (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no) which is unclear.\n\nThe check list:\nFor key 7: 76/7 = 10.86, not integer.\nFor key 8: 224/8 = 28, so f(8)=28 maybe?\nFor key 9: 467/9 ~ 51.89, not clean\nFor key 11: 1155/11 = 105 (so f(11)=105)\nFor key 12: 2683/12 approx 223.58 but then they mention k8\u00d712 - 5=2683 so that implies if we use formula k_n = ? maybe for n=12, the product is \"f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)\"? But given k8=224? Actually wait: They said \"k8 = 28x8\", so it seems like they computed f(8)=28.\n\nAlso \"k11 = 105\u00d711\" gives f(11)=105.\nThen for key 12, we have a mismatch with the simple pattern but note that k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 equals 2683. That means 224*12 - 5 = 2688 - 5 = 2683.\n\nSo they are analyzing whether some keys can be expressed in the form f(n) * n + g(n). The hypothesis is that sometimes the index itself appears in the formula, i.e., maybe f(n) or g(n) could be functions of n.\n\nThe question: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nI need to try and decipher what keys are? Possibly the sequence is given by some product pattern. The numbers provided:\nk5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12 have values?\nThey mention: k7 = 76 (so k7=76?) because they say \"76/7 = 10.86\". So k7=76? Similarly, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, k12=2683 maybe?\n\nWait: Let's re-read the text carefully:\n\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\nIt seems the keys are: k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12.\n\nWe know:\nk2? Possibly from \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\", so maybe k2 * k3 gives k5. But then they say indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no. Not sure what that means.\n\nMaybe the keys are defined recursively: For prime numbers? The observed ones: k7=76, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, k12=2683.\nAlso \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" suggests trying to express them as linear functions of n. They get f(8)=28 and f(11)=105.\n\nMaybe the pattern is something like: For some indices n that are composite maybe? Because they have a product or addition pattern.\nThe observation: k5 = k2 * k3, so possibly for prime numbers, you multiply previous keys with lower primes? But then \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" where index appears in formula.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined by some recurrence relation involving products of other terms. The user's message might be a puzzle and they want to find f(n) for each key as a function of n.\n\nLet me list what we have:\n\nWe have keys: k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12.\nAnd the values we see:\nk7 = 76\nk8 = 224\nk9 = 467\nk11 = 1155\nk12 = 2683\n\nWe also have: k5 = k2 * k3. That gives a relation between keys with indices that are primes maybe?\nI need to recall if this is known puzzle \"index product pattern\" which might be from some contest.\n\nMaybe there's a sequence defined for indices n, where:\nk_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\nand we want to calculate f(n) for each key. The values given for keys 7,8,9,11,12 are such that sometimes dividing by index gives an integer value and sometimes not.\n\nFor k7: 76/7 ~ 10.857... so no.\nk8: 224/8 = 28 exactly. So f(8) = 28 maybe? But then what is g(8)? Possibly g(8)=0?\nBut they said \"k8= ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" and then conclude 28 = k8/8.\n\nFor k11: 1155/11 = 105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\nAnd for k12: If we use division by index, it doesn't work (223.58...) but if you try \"k8 * 12 - 5\", then that works because k8 is known to be 224 and then 224*12 = 2688; subtracting 5 gives 2683 which equals k12.\n\nSo for k12: f(12) would not equal 2683/12. So maybe the pattern doesn't hold uniformly.\nBut hypothesis: sometimes index appears in formula, so we have two cases:\nCase 1: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\nCase 2: k_n = k_(something) * n + constant, where that something is a smaller key.\n\nSo perhaps for composite indices like 12, we use product with an earlier term. They already observed k5= k2*k3 and k12= k8*12 - 5.\nMaybe the idea is to try to see if f(n) equals some function of n maybe related to factorial parts or something.\n\nCheck: For k11, f(11)=105. And for k8, f(8)=28.\n\nI wonder if these numbers are connected with binomial coefficients or something? 28 is a triangular number (7*4), and 105 is also a triangular number (15*7?) Actually 105 = C(15,2) maybe? Let me check: Triangular numbers: T7=28, T14=105... Indeed 28 = T7, and 105 = T14. That might be something.\nk8's f(n)=28 which is the 7th triangular number (if we consider n-1 triangular number)? k11's f(n)=105 which is the 14th triangular number maybe? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, they might be related to prime numbers: For composite indices like 12, they use product of an earlier key times index - constant.\n\nMaybe I can assume that keys for primes (like 7 and 11) are given by f(n)*n with no remainder. So for k7: if it were of the form f(7)*7 then f(7)=76/7 which is not integer. But they don't claim that works.\nActually, check: k7=76 and maybe its formula is different? The checks:\nk7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 \u2260 integer\nk8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? yields an integer quotient (224/8=28)\nk9 gives non-integer division\nk11 gives integer division with 1155/11 =105.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for some indices n, f(n) = k_n / n is integer. And for others it's not.\n\nThe observed keys: \nn=7 -> 76 (not divisible by 7)\nn=8 -> 224 (divisible by 8 gives 28)\nn=9 -> 467 (not divisible by 9)\nn=11 -> 1155 (divisible by 11 gives 105)\nn=12 -> 2683 (divisible by 12 would give 223.583, so not integer; but then using k8 \u00d7 12 -5 gives the right result)\n\nAlso observed: k5 = k2 * k3. That might be a special rule for index 5.\n\nMaybe I can search online in my memory if there's a known sequence \"Index Product Pattern Analysis\" that relates keys to indices. Possibly it is from puzzling SE, like \"What are these keys?\" There is a puzzle by someone: \"Key Patterns\" perhaps.\n\nWe have k2, k3, etc. Maybe we have more information: The check for k7 was: 76/7 \u224810.86, so if we try to express it as f(7)*7 + g(7) maybe f(7) might be something like floor division but not sure.\n\nMaybe the question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" means derive a formula for f(n). Perhaps f(n)=? We have two integer cases: For n=8 and 11, we got f(8)=28 and f(11)=105. Is there any pattern? They are triangular numbers T7 = 28 and T14 = 105. And note that the index for k8 is 8; then maybe f(8) should equal T_7 (which is one less than 8). For n=11, f(11)=T14 but 14 is not obviously related to 11 in a simple way.\n\nMaybe it's something like: if n is composite, or if n has a factor from the earlier keys, then you use a different formula. The user says \"sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\" In k12, they have k8*12 -5. So for index 12, maybe f(12) would be computed by taking k8 (which equals 224) and dividing by something? But that's not consistent.\n\nLet's try to analyze:\n\nGiven: \nk7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ?\n= Possibly there is a formula like: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). For n=7, then if we assume integer division doesn't work.\nFor n=8: k8/8=28. So perhaps f(8)=28 and then g(8) must be 0? But then the check said \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" and they found that equals 224 = 28*8, so yes, maybe g(8)=0.\nFor n=9: k9/9=467/9 which is not integer. So if we write it in the form f(9)*9 + g(9), then f(9) might be floor division? But they want \"Calculate f(n) for each key\", so maybe f(n) = (k_n - g(n)) / n.\nBut what's g(n)? Possibly there is a pattern: for some keys, the index appears in the formula as a multiplier, but sometimes it doesn't.\n\nMaybe we need to look at the relation k12= k8*12 -5. That means if we express k12 in the form f(12)*12 + g(12), then maybe f(12) would be 224 and g(12) = -5? Because then k12 = 224*12 - 5, which is what they gave.\nSimilarly, for k11, they say 1155/11=105, so that gives f(11)=105 and g(11)=0.\nFor k8, we have f(8)=28, g(8)=0.\n\nWhat about k7? k7=76. If it were of the form f(7)*7 + g(7), then dividing 76 by 7 does not give an integer quotient; maybe f(7) = floor(76/7)? That would be 10 with remainder 6, so k7=10*7+6, but that doesn't match any pattern.\n\nAnd for k9: 467 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? Let's try division: 467/9 = 51 remainder 8, because 51*9=459, remainder 8. So maybe f(9)=51 and g(9)=8.\nFor k11: already done; f(11)=105.\nFor k12: we have k12 expressed as (k8)*12 -5, which if put into the form f(12)*12 + g(12) would give f(12)=? Possibly 224 is not working because that gives too high a product. Let's try to express 2683 in terms of 12: 2683 = 223*12 + ? remainder = 223*12 = 2676, remainder 7; so k12=223*12+7 would be one possibility, but then they specifically mention the formula k8\u00d712 -5. Wait, re-read: \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\" So that implies if we try to write it as f(12)*12+g(12), then maybe f(12)=k8? But no, that's not consistent: k8 is 224, and 224*12 would be 2688, not 2683. Instead, the formula given is \"k12 = k8\u00d712 -5\". And since we know k8=224, then k12 becomes 224*12 -5 = 2688-5 = 2683. So maybe for composite n (like 12) the formula involves a previous key value.\n\nMaybe there's a rule: If n is prime, then k_n = f(n)*n with no remainder; if n is composite, then k_n = some earlier key times n plus or minus a constant? For instance:\n- k5 = k2 * k3 (both primes?) \n- k7 doesn't follow integer division because 76/7 is not an integer. But wait, 7 is prime though.\n- k11 does: 1155/11=105.\nSo why would 7 be different? Perhaps because of some specific rule for n=7.\n\nMaybe the sequence might be defined as follows:\nFor a given key index n:\nIf n is composite, then k_n = (some earlier key)*n + adjustment,\nif n is prime, then maybe sometimes it's f(n)*n and sometimes not.\nWe have: \nk2? unknown,\nk3? unknown,\nk5= k2 * k3. So that defines k5 in terms of k2 and k3.\nWhat about k7= ? Possibly defined as: k7 = (f(7))*7 + g(7) but we don't know f(7).\nThen k8 is defined as 28*8, so f(8)=28,\nk9=51*9+8, so f(9)=51 and remainder 8.\nk11=105*11, so f(11)=105,\nk12= ? but they gave an alternative formula: k12 = k8 * 12 -5, which gives 224*12-5 =2683. So if we express that in the form f(12)*12+g(12), then f(12) would be 224 and g(12) = -5.\n\nSo maybe for n=12, the formula is different from the general pattern k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). Perhaps for composite n with a factor of an earlier key's index, you use that earlier key in the formula. Specifically, k12 uses k8 because 8 divides 12? Yes, 8 does not divide 12 though; but maybe because 8 is less than 12 and chosen arbitrarily?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are two cases: \n- When n is prime and n>5 (like 7, 11), then we have a division yielding an integer if possible. But for 7 it didn't work.\n- When n is composite, sometimes the formula involves multiplication by n of some earlier term.\n\nLet me try to infer f(n) from the given values that are integers:\nFor k8, f(8)=28.\nFor k11, f(11)=105.\nMaybe these numbers (28 and 105) have a relationship with the index. For 8, maybe f(8) equals the binomial coefficient C(8+1,2)/? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that 28 = 7*4 and 105= 15*7. And notice: for n=8, maybe f(8)=T_7 where T_n = n(n+1)/2. For n=11, f(11)=T_{14} because T_{14}=105 (since 14*15/2=105). So maybe there is a pattern: f(n) equals the triangular number with index something function of n. \nFor n=8: maybe it's T_(n-1)=T7 = 28.\nFor n=11: maybe it's T_(2n -? ) Wait, if n=11 then T_{something} equals 105. Which triangular numbers are 105? T14=105 (since 14*15/2=105). So maybe f(11)=T14, and note that 14 = 2*(11) - 8, but for 8 it would be 2*8-? That doesn't match.\n\nMaybe instead: For k12, if we try to see a pattern from k8: k8=224. And then k12 is given by multiplying k8 by 12 and subtracting 5. So maybe f(12)=k8 = 224, which interestingly equals 7*32? Not sure.\n\nWait, 28 (from k8) came up in the product for k12: 224 * 12 - 5 = 2683.\nSo it looks like k8 is being reused for constructing k12. And k2 and k3 were used to construct k5 as their product.\n\nMaybe there's a rule that for indices that are composite (or have prime factors that are earlier keys), the formula involves a multiplication by n of some previous key value.\n\nWe have: \nk5 = k2 * k3, which means f(5) and g(5) would be such that  k5 = ? But in the form f(5)*5 + g(5), if we assume it's not following the pattern because it's defined by product of earlier keys. So maybe for n=5, there is no \"f(5)\" in the sense of division by n gives an integer.\n\nMaybe I can try to solve for k2 and k3 using the given relationships? They are unknown but might be determined from consistency with other values if we assume some pattern for all keys. We have:\nk5 = k2 * k3.\nAlso, maybe there's a formula for primes: For n=7, k7 should equal f(7)*7 + g(7) where f(7) and g(7) are unknown integers. But 76 divided by 7 gives quotient 10 remainder 6, so one possibility is f(7)=10 and g(7)=6.\nFor n=11, we have k11 = 1155; dividing by 11: quotient 105, remainder 0, so f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\nFor n=8, we already deduced f(8)=28, g(8)=0.\nFor n=9, 467 divided by 9 gives quotient 51 and remainder 8, so maybe f(9)=51, g(9)=8.\nFor n=12, if we try to express it in the form f(12)*12+g(12), then 2683/12 = 223 with remainder 7 (since 223*12=2676, plus 7 gives 2683). So one possibility is f(12)=223 and g(12)=7. But we also have k12 expressed as k8\u00d712 -5 which is 224\u00d712 -5 = 2688-5=2683, so that would correspond to writing it as (k8)*12 + (-5). And note k8 itself equals 28*8, so that doesn't match a simple pattern of f(12) being a triangular number.\n\nMaybe the intended answer is: \nf(2) = ?,\nf(3)= ?,\nf(5)= ?,\nf(7)=10? (if we choose quotient from division)\nf(8)=28,\nf(9)=51,\nf(11)=105,\nand f(12)=223 if we write it in the form k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). But then what about the role of \"sometimes the index appears in the formula\"? The user message might be incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the puzzle is: \"Find a function f(n) such that for some keys, k_n equals f(n)*n plus something.\" And we have two formulas:\n- For prime indices (other than 5 maybe): sometimes you can divide evenly.\n- For composite ones like 12, you get an extra term.\n\nLet's re-read the user's message carefully:\n\nUser: \"Sometimes the index appears in the formula. ... k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712 -5 = 2683.\" So they are checking if dividing by 12 gives an integer coefficient, and it doesn't; however, multiplying k8 (which is known to be divisible by 8 evenly) by 12 and subtracting 5 gives the correct result for k12. And similarly, they mention \"k5 = k2*k3\".\n\nSo likely the answer should list:\nf(7) might not be defined as an integer because it doesn't divide evenly.\nFor k8, f(8)=28.\nFor k9, f(9)=51 (if you take floor division).\nFor k11, f(11)=105.\nFor k12, if we express in the form \"k_n = ? \u00d7 n + ?\", then it's not straightforward because the index 12 does not cleanly divide. But if we try to match the pattern with k8 being used in constructing k12, then maybe for composite numbers we have a different rule: k12 = (f(8))*12 -5, so f(8) is reused here.\n\nMaybe the answer expects:\n- For n=7, since 76/7 is not an integer, it doesn't follow the form \"k_n = f(n)*n\", so f(7) is undefined in that sense.\n- For n=8, we have k8 = 28 \u00d7 8 + 0, hence f(8)=28.\n- For n=9, k9 = 51\u00d79+8, so if we insist on a division by 9, then the coefficient isn't an integer. But if we write it as \"k_n = (something)*n + something\", then maybe they want to show that sometimes the index is part of the multiplication factor.\n- For n=11, k11 = 105\u00d711+0, so f(11)=105.\n- For n=12, although dividing by 12 doesn't give an integer coefficient, we can express it as (k8)*12 -5, i.e., using k8's value. So in that case, the effective multiplier is k8.\n\nMaybe the answer should be: \n\nf(2) and f(3) are arbitrary? Not sure.\n\nWait \"Sometimes the index appears in the formula\" might mean that when trying to factor k_n as a product of an integer times n plus something, sometimes you can pull out the index from the multiplier. For example:\n- For k8, 28\u00d78 is neat.\n- For k11, 105\u00d711 works perfectly.\n- For k9 and k7, dividing by the index doesn't yield an integer coefficient.\n\nSo perhaps the answer: \"The function f(n) which gives the quotient when k_n is divided by n (if it divides evenly) only works for n=8 and n=11. In general, you might have to write k_n as a linear combination of n and 1.\" \nSpecifically:\nk5 = k2*k3,\nk7 cannot be written in the form f(7)*7 + g(7) with integer f(7), but rather 76 = 10*7 + 6.\nSimilarly, k9 = 51*9 + 8.\nAnd k12 can be expressed as (k8)*12 -5.\n\nThus the answer: \nf(2) is not given,\nf(3) is not given,\nfor n=5, it's defined by product of earlier keys,\nfor n=7, if forced into that form, f(7)=10 and remainder 6,\nfor n=8, f(8)=28 (since 224 = 28\u00d78),\nfor n=9, f(9)=51 with a remainder of 8,\nfor n=11, f(11)=105 (1155 = 105\u00d711), and\nfor n=12, the formula becomes k12 = (k8)*12 -5, so the coefficient effectively is k8 which equals 224.\n\nMaybe the answer should list these coefficients:\nn:   k_n:    representation as (coefficient)*n + remainder\n2:   unknown,\n3:   unknown,\n5:   = k2*k3 (so no linear form with n),\n7:   76 = 10*7 + 6, so f(7)=10 and remainder 6,\n8:   224 = 28*8 + 0, so f(8)=28,\n9:   467 = 51*9 + 8, so f(9)=51,\n11: 1155 = 105*11 + 0, so f(11)=105,\n12: 2683 = (224)*12 - 5, i.e., can be written as 224*12 -5.\n\nSo the answer is: \nFor k7 and k9, dividing by n doesn't yield a neat coefficient; while for k8 and k11 it does. And in particular, note that k12 uses k8 (which came from 8) rather than following the pattern of being divisible by 12.\n\nTherefore, the answer: f(2)=?, f(3)=?; but then:\nf(5) is defined via multiplication,\nfor n=7, if we force a representation, f(7)=10 remainder 6;\nn=8 yields f(8)=28 exactly,\nn=9 yields f(9)=51 with remainder 8,\nn=11 yields f(11)=105 exactly,\nand for n=12, the formula is k12 = (k8)*12 -5.\n\nI think the answer expects something like: \"Notice that sometimes the index n appears explicitly in the coefficient of the multiplication. For example, k8 and k11 are multiples of 8 and 11 respectively, while k7 and k9 have non-integer quotients when divided by their indices. Moreover, k12 is built using k8, which shows that the pattern doesn't always involve a simple factorization with the index.\"\n\nMaybe I'll answer:\n\nAnswer:\nWe observe that not all keys can be written as an integer multiple of their index plus a constant. For example, while k11 = 1155 factors neatly as 105\u00d711, k7 = 76 gives quotient 10 remainder 6 (i.e., 76 = 10\u00d77 + 6), and k9 = 467 = 51\u00d79 + 8. Also, note that k5 is defined by the product of earlier keys: k5 = k2\u00b7k3. Furthermore, although one might try to write k12 in the form f(12)\u00d712 + g(12), it turns out that a neat representation comes from using k8 directly: k12 = 224\u00d712 \u2013 5 (since k8 = 224). \n\nThus, the function f(n) defined by f(n) = [k_n - g(n)]/n (with an appropriate choice of remainder g(n)) only yields integer values for some indices (n=8 and n=11), while in other cases the index does not neatly factor out. In particular, we have:\n\u2022 For n = 7: 76 = 10\u00d77 + 6,\n\u2022 For n = 8: 224 = 28\u00d78 + 0,\n\u2022 For n = 9: 467 = 51\u00d79 + 8,\n\u2022 For n = 11: 1155 = 105\u00d711 + 0,\nand\n\u2022 k12 can be written as (k8)\u00d712 \u2013 5.\nThis demonstrates that the index sometimes appears explicitly in the multiplier when such a neat factorization exists, but not always.\n\nI'll provide that answer.</think>One acceptable answer was to notice that although many of the keys can be \u201cfactored\u201d with their index n, some cannot. For example, one may try to write\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n)\n\nwith an integer f(n) and a remainder g(n). In our list we have:\n\n\u2022 k\u2085 is defined by k\u2082 and k\u2083 via\n\u2003\u2003k\u2085 = k\u2082 \u00b7 k\u2083 \n(which does not \u201clook like\u201d an expression of the form f(5)\u00b75 + g(5)).\n\n\u2022 For n = 7 we have k\u2087 = 76. Dividing by 7 gives\n\u2003\u200376 = 10\u00b77 + 6,\nso if one were to force a representation of that type, then f(7) would be 10 (with remainder 6).\n\n\u2022 For n = 8 the number is very \u201cnice\u201d since k\u2088 = 224 and\n\u2003\u2003224 = 28 \u00b7 8 + 0,\nso here we may take f(8)=28.\n\n\u2022 Similarly, for n = 9 one finds k\u2089 = 467 and\n\u2003\u2003467 = 51 \u00b7 9 + 8,\nso one might write f(9)=51 (with remainder 8).\n\n\u2022 For n = 11 the key is k\u2081\u2081 = 1155 and it factors exactly:\n\u2003\u20031155 = 105 \u00b7 11 + 0,\nso we may take f(11)=105.\n\n\u2022 Finally, although one might try to write\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = f(12)\u00b712 + g(12),\none finds that dividing 2683 by 12 does not give an integer. However, note that since k\u2088 = 224 we have\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 224 \u00b7 12 \u2013 5.\nThat is, the \u201cnice\u201d factor of 12 in this case comes from reusing k\u2088 rather than having f(12) be an independent number.\n\nThus one acceptable answer is to point out that sometimes the index appears explicitly as a multiplier (as for n = 8 or 11), while at other times it does not (as for n = 7, 9, and 12). In our case we have\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2087 = 10\u00b77 + 6,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2088 = 28\u00b78 + 0,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2089 = 51\u00b79 + 8,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 105\u00b711 + 0,\n\u2003\u2003and\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = (k\u2088)\u00b712 \u2013 5.\n\nAny answer that explains these facts is correct.",
