  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to check if the given sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence relation. The specific question is asking whether the sequence can be described by a recurrence relation of the form \\( k_n = a \\times k_{n-1} + b \\times k_{n-2} \\), and also considering if there might be a constant term \\( c \\) added. The given terms are \\( k_7 = 76 \\) and \\( k_8 = 224 \\). The goal is to find integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), and possibly \\( c \\), that satisfy these equations. Then, if such a recurrence is found, we can use it to predict \\( k_{15} \\) and \\( k_{16} \\).\n\nFirst, let me focus on the first part where they want to check if there's a linear recurrence without a constant term. The equations provided are:\n\nFor \\( k_7 = 76 \\):\n\\( 76 = 49a + 21b \\)\n\nFor \\( k_8 = 224 \\):\n\\( 224 = 76a + 49b \\)\n\nSo, I need to solve this system of equations for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Let me write them out again:\n\n1. \\( 49a + 21b = 76 \\)\n2. \\( 76a + 49b = 224 \\)\n\nHmm, okay. Let me see if I can solve this system. Since both equations are linear in \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), I can use either substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination.\n\nFirst, maybe I can multiply the first equation by 76 and the second equation by 49 so that the coefficients of \\( a \\) will be the same, and then subtract them? Wait, that might get too big. Alternatively, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other from the first equation and substitute into the second.\n\nLet me try solving the first equation for \\( a \\):\n\n\\( 49a = 76 - 21b \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( a = (76 - 21b)/49 \\)\n\nHmm, but this might lead to fractions, but maybe when substituted into the second equation, things will cancel out?\n\nLet me plug this into the second equation:\n\n\\( 76a + 49b = 224 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( a = (76 -21b)/49 \\):\n\n\\( 76*( (76 -21b)/49 ) + 49b = 224 \\)\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: 76*(76 -21b)/49\n\nSecond term: 49b\n\nSo, combining them equals 224.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nFirst term numerator: 76*(76 -21b) = 76*76 - 76*21b\n\n76*76 is 5776, and 76*21 is 1596, so:\n\nFirst term numerator: 5776 - 1596b\n\nDivide by 49: (5776 - 1596b)/49\n\nSecond term: 49b\n\nSo adding them together:\n\n(5776 -1596b)/49 + 49b = 224\n\nMultiply everything by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n5776 -1596b + 49*49b = 224*49\n\nCompute each term:\n\n49*49 is 2401, so the second term becomes 2401b.\n\n224*49: Let's see, 224*50 would be 11200, so subtract 224: 11200 -224 = 10976.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n5776 -1596b + 2401b = 10976\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-1596b +2401b) +5776 =10976\n\n(2401-1596)b = 805b, so:\n\n805b +5776 =10976\n\nSubtract 5776 from both sides:\n\n805b =10976 -5776\n\nCompute 10976 -5776:\n\n10976 minus 5000 is 5976, then minus 776 more is 5976 -776 = 5200? Wait, wait, let me do it step by step:\n\n10976 minus 5776:\n\n10976 - 5000 = 5976\n\n5976 - 776 = 5200? Wait, no: 5976 - 700 = 5276, then minus 76 is 5200. Yes, that's right. 5976 - 776 = 5200.\n\nThus,\n\n805b = 5200\n\nSo, solving for b:\n\nb = 5200 /805\n\nLet me simplify this fraction. Let's see if 5 divides both:\n\n5200 divided by 5 is 1040, 805 divided by 5 is 161.\n\nSo, 5200/805 = 1040/161.\n\nHmm, 1040 divided by 161. Let me see if 161 divides into 1040 evenly?\n\n161*6 = 966, 1040 - 966 =74, so no. 161*6.4 maybe? Not an integer.\n\nHmm, so b is 1040/161 which is approximately 6.46? So not an integer. Hmm, but the problem said \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So that's a problem because b is not integer here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check all steps again.\n\nStarting with substitution:\n\nEquation 1: 49a +21b =76\n\nEquation 2:76a +49b=224\n\nExpress a from first equation:\n\n49a =76-21b\n\nThus,\n\na = (76 -21b)/49\n\nThen plugging into equation 2:\n\n76a +49b =224\n\n76*(76-21b)/49 +49b =224\n\nCompute numerator of first term:76*(76-21b)\n\nYes, 76*76=5776, 76*21=1596, so 76*(76-21b)=5776-1596b\n\nThen divide by 49: (5776 -1596b)/49\n\nThen adding 49b: (5776 -1596b)/49 +49b\n\nMultiply all terms by 49:\n\n5776 -1596b + (49b)*49 =224*49\n\nWait, hold on. Wait the second term is 49b, so when multiplied by 49:\n\nWait no. Let me re-express:\n\nThe equation after substitution is:\n\n(5776 -1596b)/49 +49b =224\n\nMultiply all terms by 49:\n\n5776 -1596b + (49b)*49 = 224*49\n\nWait, but (49b)*49 is 49^2 b, which is 2401b, yes.\n\nSo that part was correct. Then 5776 -1596b +2401b = 10976\n\nSo 5776 + (2401b -1596b) =5776 +805b =10976\n\nThus, 805b =10976 -5776 =5200, so b=5200/805.\n\nHmm, maybe I miscalculated 224*49. Let me verify that:\n\n224 * 49: 200*49 =9800, 24*49=1176, so total 9800 +1176=10976. That's correct.\n\n5776 is 76 squared? 76*76 is indeed 5776. So that's right.\n\nHmm, so b is 5200 divided by 805. Let me see if both numbers can be divided by 5 again:\n\n5200 /5 =1040, 805/5=161. 1040 and 161.\n\nDoes 161 divide into 1040? Let's see, 161*6=966, 1040-966=74. 161*0.459... so no. So that fraction reduces to 1040/161. Hmm, so unless there was a miscalculation, this suggests that there are no integer solutions for a and b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in setting up the equations?\n\nWait, the problem says \"For k7=76: 76= a\u00d749 +b\u00d721\". So that is assuming that k7 is expressed in terms of previous terms, which would be k6 and k5? Wait, but the problem here might be that they are using k_{n}=a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2}, so to get k7, you need k6 and k5? Wait but in the equations given, they have 49 and 21. Wait, maybe 49 is k6 and 21 is k5? So perhaps the terms before k7 are k6=49 and k5=21? So that would make sense. So the equations are set up correctly as per the problem's setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the previous terms are not given, so perhaps the question is only given k7 and k8, but not the earlier terms? Wait, but in order to set up the equations as above, the user must have prior knowledge of k6 and k5? Wait, the problem as presented here might be part of a larger problem where previous terms are known?\n\nWait, the user's message is a bit unclear. The initial problem is to check if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence. The user then provides specific equations for k7 and k8, using previous terms k6=49 and k5=21? Because otherwise, where did those numbers come from?\n\nWait, perhaps in the original problem, the sequence up to k8 is given? Maybe k1 to k8 are known, and they are using k7 and k8 to set up the equations, but the problem as presented here is only showing the two equations? Maybe the user is following a prior example where k5=21, k6=49, so then k7=76, k8=224?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is part of a sequence where previous terms are known, and the user is trying to see if from k5 to k8, the recurrence holds. Since the equations given are based on k7=76 =a*k6 + b*k5, so k6 must be 49 and k5=21, so that 49a +21b=76, and then k8=224= a*76 +b*49.\n\nSo assuming that the prior terms are known, like k5=21, k6=49, then k7=76, k8=224, then the equations are correct.\n\nSo given that, then solving for a and b gives fractional values, so no integer solutions. So the answer is no? But the problem says \"Can you find integer a,b?\" So maybe the answer is no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an arithmetic mistake. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, instead of substituting, let's use elimination.\n\nWe have:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me try to eliminate one variable. Let's try to eliminate 'a'.\n\nMultiply equation1 by 76 and equation2 by 49:\n\nEquation1 *76: 49*76 a +21*76 b =76*76\n\nEquation2 *49:76*49 a +49*49 b =224*49\n\nThen subtract equation1*76 from equation2*49:\n\n[76*49a +49^2 b] - [49*76a +21*76b] =224*49 -76^2\n\nNotice the a terms cancel out:\n\n(76*49a -49*76a)=0\n\nThen the remaining terms:\n\n49^2 b -21*76 b = (49^2 -21*76)b = RHS\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\nFirst, compute LHS:\n\n49\u00b2 is 2401, 21*76 is 1596.\n\nSo, 2401 -1596 = 805\n\nThus, 805b = (224*49 -76\u00b2)\n\nCompute RHS:\n\n224*49: as before, that's 10976\n\n76 squared is 5776\n\nThus 10976 -5776 = 5200\n\nSo, 805b =5200\n\nThus, b=5200/805 = same as before, so same fraction. So, same result.\n\nSo, that's consistent, so b is 5200/805, which reduces to 1040/161, which is not an integer. So that suggests that there are no integer a and b that satisfy the equations. Therefore, the answer is no, there are no integer coefficients a and b for the linear recurrence without a constant term.\n\nHmm, so maybe the user then says \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\". So maybe there is a constant term c. Let's try that.\n\nSo, now we have to consider a recurrence relation of the form:\n\n\\( k_n = a \\times k_{n-1} + b \\times k_{n-2} + c \\)\n\nThen, using the same data points, we can set up equations for k7 and k8.\n\nGiven that, then:\n\nFor k7 =76:\n\n76 = a*k6 + b*k5 + c\n\nAssuming again k6=49, k5=21, so:\n\n76 = a*49 + b*21 + c --> equation1:49a +21b +c=76\n\nSimilarly for k8=224:\n\n224 =a*k7 +b*k6 +c = a*76 +b*49 +c --> equation2:76a +49b +c=224\n\nBut now we have two equations with three variables a,b,c. So we need another equation. To get another equation, perhaps we need to use another term from the sequence. Wait, but the problem only provides k7 and k8. Maybe we can use the previous term, like k6=49, but if we try to write the recurrence for k6, then we need k5 and k4.\n\nWait, unless the user is assuming that the recurrence starts earlier? Alternatively, maybe the problem is part of a larger sequence where more terms are known. Since the user mentions predicting k15 and k16, it's possible that more terms are given in the original problem, but here only k7 and k8 are shown. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is suggesting that even with a constant term, we can still set up equations with the given information? Since we have two equations for three variables, we might need to find a solution where c is a constant, but perhaps also considering that the recurrence must hold for all terms, so maybe the system can be solved with some conditions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects us to assume that the recurrence holds for all terms, so that equations can be built from prior terms as well. Let me see:\n\nSuppose that the recurrence \\( k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2} + c \\) holds for all n \u22653 (or some starting point). Then, if we have enough terms, we can set up multiple equations. But in this case, we only have two equations from k7 and k8. To solve for three variables, we need at least three equations. Unless we can assume that the constant term c is the same across all equations, perhaps we can use another term?\n\nWait, the problem mentions predicting k15 and k16, so perhaps in the original problem, more terms are given. Since the user hasn't provided all terms, maybe in the original context, there were more terms, but here, only k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224 are given? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is following the example of a similar problem where three terms are given? Maybe in this problem, the sequence is given up to k8, and the user is to find a,b,c such that the recurrence holds for k7 and k8, but also for an earlier term?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects us to consider that the recurrence must hold for k6 as well? For example, if we have k6=49, which would be expressed as:\n\nk6 = a*k5 + b*k4 +c\n\nBut since we don't know k4, this complicates things. Alternatively, if the user assumes that the recurrence starts at n=5 or something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that even with the constant term, we can find integer a,b,c. Let me try to see.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1)49a +21b +c =76\n\n2)76a +49b +c =224\n\nSubtract equation1 from equation2:\n\n(76a -49a) + (49b -21b) + (c -c) =224 -76\n\n27a +28b =148 --> equation3:27a +28b =148\n\nNow, we can try to solve for a and b in integers. Let me see if there are integer solutions.\n\nWe have 27a +28b =148\n\nLet me try to find integers a,b.\n\nLet me rearrange for a:\n\n27a =148 -28b\n\na=(148 -28b)/27\n\nWe need (148 -28b) divisible by27.\n\nLet me see possible integer values for b.\n\nLet me try b=1:\n\n148-28=120 \u2192120/27\u22484.44\u2192 not integer\n\nb=2:148-56=92 \u219292/27\u22483.407\u2192 no\n\nb=3:148-84=64 \u219264/27\u22482.37\u2192 no\n\nb=4:148-112=36 \u219236/27=1.333\u2026 \u2192 no\n\nb=5:148-140=8 \u21928/27\u2192 no\n\nb=0:148/27\u22485.48\u2026\u2192 no\n\nb= -1:148+28=176 \u2192176/27\u22486.518\u2026\u2192 no\n\nHmm, not working.\n\nAlternatively, try modulo 27:\n\n27a \u2261148 mod28?\n\nWait, equation is 27a +28b=148\n\nLet me consider modulo 28:\n\n27a \u2261148 mod28\n\n27 mod28 is 27, 148 mod28: 28*5=140, so 148-140=8, so 27a \u22618 mod28\n\nMultiply both sides by the inverse of 27 mod28. Since gcd(27,28)=1, inverse exists.\n\nFind x such that 27x \u22611 mod28.\n\n27 \u2261-1 mod28, so inverse is -1 mod28=27.\n\nThus, multiply both sides by27:\n\n27*27a \u226127*8 mod28\n\n(-1)(-1)a \u2261( -1)*8 mod28 ?\n\nWait, 27 \u2261-1 mod28, so 27*27 \u2261(-1)*(-1)=1 mod28. So:\n\na \u226127*8 mod28\n\n27*8=216; 216 mod28: 28*7=196, 216-196=20 \u2192a\u226120 mod28.\n\nThus, a=28k +20 for some integer k.\n\nPlug back into equation:\n\n27a +28b=148\n\n27*(28k +20)+28b=148\n\n27*28k +27*20 +28b=148\n\n756k +540 +28b=148\n\n756k +28b =148 -540= -392\n\nDivide both sides by28:\n\n27k +b =-14\n\nThus, b= -14 -27k\n\nThus, solutions are:\n\na=28k +20\n\nb= -14 -27k\n\nfor integer k.\n\nNow, let's see if there are integer k such that a and b are integers (they are by construction), but also such that c is an integer. Since c=76 -49a -21b.\n\nLet me compute c for some k.\n\nTake k=0:\n\na=20, b= -14\n\nc=76 -49*20 -21*(-14)=76 -980 +294=76 -686= -610\n\nSo c= -610. That's an integer, but the coefficients are quite large. Let me check if this works for equation2:\n\nEquation2:76a +49b +c =76*20 +49*(-14) + (-610)=1520 -686 -610= 1520-1296=224. Yes, that works.\n\nSo one solution is a=20, b=-14, c=-610.\n\nAlternatively, take k=-1:\n\na=28*(-1)+20= -8\n\nb= -14 -27*(-1)= -14+27=13\n\nThen c=76 -49*(-8) -21*(13)=76 +392 -273= 76+119=195\n\nCheck equation2:\n\n76*(-8)+49*(13)+195= -608 +637 +195= ( -608+637)=29 +195=224. Yes, that works.\n\nSo another solution: a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nSimilarly, k=1:\n\na=28*1+20=48\n\nb= -14 -27*1= -41\n\nc=76 -49*48 -21*(-41)=76 -2352 +861= (76+861)=937 -2352= -1415\n\nCheck equation2:76*48 +49*(-41) + (-1415)= 3648 -2009 -1415= 3648 -3424=224. Correct.\n\nThus, there are infinitely many solutions with integer coefficients, depending on k.\n\nBut the problem says \"Can you find integer a,b?\" probably meaning for the original equation without c? Since with c, there are solutions, but with the constant term. Since the problem says \"Also try...\", maybe the user is suggesting that with a constant term, there are solutions, so perhaps the answer is yes, but with a constant term. However, the original question was \"Can you find integer a,b?\" for the Fibonacci-like recurrence, which is without the constant term. Since without c, there are no solutions, but with c, there are. So maybe the answer is that with a constant term, there are solutions, but without, there aren't.\n\nHowever, the problem statement is a bit unclear. Since the user says \"F: please wrap your final answer in \\boxed{}\", maybe the question is expecting a yes/no answer, but given the context, maybe the answer is that there are no integer a and b for the linear recurrence without a constant term, but there are with a constant term. However, since the problem mentions \"Fibonacci-like\", which typically doesn't have a constant term. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that there is a solution with fractional coefficients, but the user is to present them? But the question specifically asks for integer a and b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in the problem setup. Let me check with the numbers given:\n\nIf k5=21, k6=49, then if the recurrence were, say, k_n = 2*k_{n-1} - k_{n-2}, then k7 would be 2*49 -21=77, but here it's 76, close but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k_n = (3/2)*k_{n-1} - (1/2)*k_{n-2}\n\nThen 3/2 *49 -1/2*21 =73.5 -10.5=63, no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects the answer in terms of the constant term? Since the question is a bit ambiguous, but given the instructions, I think the problem is asking whether there exists integers a and b (without c) such that the recurrence holds for the given terms. Since we saw that without a constant term, there are no solutions, so the answer would be \"No\", but since the user says \"F: please wrap your final answer in \\boxed{}\", maybe the problem expects the values of a and b with the constant term? But in that case, there are multiple solutions. Alternatively, maybe there's a minimal solution?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in another context where the coefficients are fractions? But the user specifies \"integer\".\n\nWait, maybe I made an error in the equations?\n\nWait let me recheck:\n\nGiven k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224.\n\nAssuming linear recurrence of order 2: k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2} + c.\n\nThen equations:\n\nFor k7=76:76 = a*49 + b*21 +c\n\nFor k8=224:224= a*76 + b*49 +c\n\nSubtract first equation from second: 224-76 = a*(76-49)+b*(49-21)\n\n148= a*27 + b*28, which is the same as equation3 above.\n\nSo indeed, 27a +28b=148.\n\nWe need integer solutions. As above, there are solutions with a and b integers, but with a constant term c also integer.\n\nHowever, if the problem requires a linear recurrence without the constant term (i.e., c=0), then the equation is 27a +28b=148, but with c=0, then from first equation:\n\n76=49a +21b\n\n224=76a +49b\n\nBut then solving:\n\nLet me write equations:\n\n1)49a +21b =76\n\n2)76a +49b=224\n\nLet me try to solve this system.\n\nMultiply first equation by 49: 49*49a +49*21b =49*76\n\nSecond equation multiplied by21:21*76a +21*49b=21*224\n\nSubtract the two equations:\n\n(49^2 a -21*76a) + (49*21b -21*49b)=49*76 -21*224\n\nFirst terms: a*(49\u00b2 -21*76) +0=49*76 -21*224\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\n49\u00b2=2401, 21*76=1596; so 2401-1596=805\n\nRHS:49*76=3724; 21*224=4704 \u21923724-4704= -980\n\nThus, 805a = -980 \u2192 a= -980/805= -196/161= -28/23\n\nSimilarly, substitute a back into first equation:\n\n49*(-28/23) +21b=76\n\n-1372/23 +21b=76 \u219221b=76 +1372/23= (76*23 +1372)/23= (1748 +1372)/23=3120/23 \u2192 b= (3120/23)/21= 3120/(23*21)= 3120/483= 1040/161\u22486.46\n\nThus, a=-28/23 and b=1040/161, which are not integers, so no solution without the constant term.\n\nHence, the answer is that there are no integer a and b for the linear recurrence without a constant term, but there are solutions with a constant term. Since the question specifically asks for integer a and b, the answer is no. But maybe the problem expects the answer with the constant term, in that case, the user might need to specify, but given the problem statement as presented, the answer is that there are no such integers a and b. Hence, the boxed answer would be \\boxed{No} but since the user might expect numerical values, perhaps I misunderstood.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find a and b for the recurrence relation from k5 to k6 etc., but with a different order? Like maybe a third-order recurrence? The question is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find a and b such that the sequence follows k_{n} = a k_{n-1} + b.\n\nWait, if it's a first-order recurrence:\n\nk7 = a k6 +b \u219276=49a +b\n\nk8= a*76 +b=224\n\nThen subtract: 224 -76 = a*(76-49) \u2192148=27a \u2192a=148/27 \u22485.48\u2026 not integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in another form?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find a and b for a second-order linear recurrence without constant term, and the given terms are different?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers given are different? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"F: please wrap your final answer in \\boxed{}\"\n\nOriginal problem: \"Fibonacci-like\" recurrence, asking for integer a and b. Given that in the equations there are no integer solutions without a constant term, but there are with, so if the problem allows a constant term, then possible, but since Fibonacci doesn't have a constant term, maybe the answer is that there are no such integers, so \\boxed{No} ?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait let me check with another approach.\n\nSuppose the recurrence is k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2}\n\nWe have:\n\nFor n=7:76 = a*49 +b*21\n\nFor n=8:224 =a*76 +b*49\n\nWe can write this as a system:\n\n49a +21b =76 \u2192 divide by7:7a +3b=76/7\u224810.857, which is not integer. So no solution.\n\nThus, there are no integer solutions, so the answer is no. Hence, boxed answer \\boxed{No}\n\nBut the user might expect values of a and b even if non-integer? But the question says integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to solve for a and b with continued terms? The user mentions predicting k15 and k16, but without more terms it's underdetermined.\n\nGiven the information, the answer is that there are no integers a and b. So \\boxed{No}\n\nBut perhaps the question is to find the values even if fractional? If so, then:\n\nFrom 27a +28b=148 and 49a +21b=76 (with c=0), but that system has no solution as above.\n\nAlternatively, with c, the minimal solution like a=20, b=-14, c=-610? But the problem didn't specify to include c.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem statement as presented by the user:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"F: please wrap your final answer in \\boxed{}\"\n\nBut the actual problem wasn't fully written by the user. Wait, hold on, looking back:\n\nWait, the user's message is:\n\n\"F: please wrap your final answer in \\boxed{}\"\n\nBut the problem description is not fully here? Wait, the user's first message is:\n\n\"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}\"\n\nThen the problem is \"Fibonacci-like\" but the exact question isn't fully here? Wait, maybe there was a formatting error. Let me check:\n\nWait, the original input from the user is:\n\n\"F: please wrap your final answer in \\boxed{}\"\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to paste a problem but it's missing. Looking at the history:\n\nWait, looking at the initial user message:\n\nUser: Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}\n\nUser: Fibonacci-like\n\nThen my response: I'm sorry, I need more information to solve this problem. Could you please provide the complete question?\n\nThen user: F: please wrap your final answer in \\boxed{}\n\nWait, perhaps there was a formatting error and the actual problem is missing. Alternatively, maybe the problem is as follows: \"Find integers a and b such that the sequence 21, 49, 76, 224,... follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence relation k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2}\"?\n\nAssuming that, then as we saw, there are no such integers a and b, so the answer is \\boxed{No} or stating no solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find a and b with a different order or different terms?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are different. For example, maybe the third term is different?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a second-order recurrence with a constant term. In that case, the equations are:\n\n76=49a +21b +c\n\n224=76a +49b +c\n\nSubtracting gives 148=27a +28b\n\nWe need a third equation for three variables, but we don't have a fourth term. Without more terms, we can't determine uniquely, but assuming the recurrence holds from the start, maybe with initial terms?\n\nWait, if the sequence starts at k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224, then to form the recurrence, we need at least two preceding terms. Maybe the problem assumes it's a second-order recurrence starting from k5, so:\n\nk7 = a k6 + b k5 \u219276=49a +21b\n\nk8= a k7 +b k6 \u2192224=76a +49b\n\nThis is the same system as before, leading to non-integer solutions.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a third-order recurrence, but without more terms, can't solve.\n\nGiven all that, the conclusion is there's no such integers a and b for a second-order linear recurrence without constant term. So the answer is no. Hence, boxed answer \\boxed{No}\n\nBut maybe the question expects the values of a and b even if fractional? Then:\n\nFrom 27a +28b=148 and 49a +21b=76 (assuming c=0)\n\nSolving:\n\nLet me use equations:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b=224\n\nLet me solve this system.\n\nLet me multiply equation1 by 49: 49*49a +49*21b =49*76 \u2192 2401a +1029b=3724\n\nMultiply equation2 by21:21*76a +21*49b=21*224 \u2192 1596a +1029b=4704\n\nNow subtract equation1*49 - equation2*21:\n\n(2401a -1596a) + (1029b -1029b)=3724 -4704\n\n805a =-980 \u2192a= -980/805= -196/161\u2248-1.217\n\nThen from equation1:49*(-196/161)+21b=76 \u2192- (49*196)/161 +21b=76\n\n49 and 161: 161=23*7, 49=7\u00b2. So 49/161=7/23\n\nThus, - (7/23)*196 +21b=76 \u2192 - (1372)/23 +21b=76 \u219221b=76 +1372/23= (76*23 +1372)/23= (1748+1372)/23=3120/23\n\nThus, b= (3120/23)/21= 3120/(23*21)= 3120/483= divide numerator and denominator by 3: 1040/161\u22486.46\n\nSo a\u2248-1.217, b\u22486.46, which are not integers. So no solution.\n\nHence, the answer is no integer solutions. Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{No}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{No}\n",
