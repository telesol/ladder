It appears we have keys with index number in the name: k2, k3, k5, etc. The observed ones:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3, but that formula is not used? Actually \"k5\" is product of keys k2 and k3 apparently.\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (or maybe the pattern was: k12 equals something times index and then some constant offset. The observed pattern in several cases, such as k8 and k11.\n\nWe are given further checks:\n1. k7 calculation: It appears that if we try to represent it in form f(n)*n + g(n), then for key 7, the fraction is 76/7 = 10.86. So not integer.\n2. k8: \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" and then \"224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713\", so it implies that maybe k8 equals 28*8? Actually text says: \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8\". So apparently, f(8) might be 28 and then g(n)=0 if we express as f(n)*n. But wait check formula: \"k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)\". For key 8, the result is 224? Because they computed 224/8=28 so k8/8 equals 28. So maybe k8 = 8 * (something).\n3. k9 calculation: fraction 467/9 = 51.89, not integer.\n4. k11: fraction 1155/11 = 105 which is integer, and then \"k11= ? \u00d7 11 + ?\" \u2192 it yields that the quotient when divided by 11 is 105. So k11= 11*105. Then they have text \"So k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n5. k12: fraction gives 2683/12 approximates to 223.58, but then note that if we use formula: k8\u00d712-5 = 2683, so it implies the pattern is: k12 equals (k8 \u00d7 index) - constant? Wait let's re-read text:\n\"5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". So that means, apparently, k8 * 12 - 5 equals k12. And k8 is 28 (from previous), so then k8 * 12 = 336, and minus 5 gives 331, but wait no: \"k8=28, so 28*12=336; 336-5=331\"? But the text says k12=2683, which contradicts that. Let's re-read:\n\"2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". Wait, they are saying: \"k8 * 12 - 5\" equals 2683. But if k8 = 28 then 28*12=336 and minus 5 is 331, not 2683. So maybe k8 means something else in that context? Possibly there's a misprint or misinterpretation. Let me re-read the original text carefully:\n\nThe message: \n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\nWait, so maybe the numbers \"224\", \"467\", \"1155\", \"2683\" are the key values for keys with indices 8,9,11,12 respectively. And then they propose that sometimes it appears as f(n)*n + g(n). They want to calculate f(n) for each key.\n\nWe have:\nk2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. Actually the text \"OBSERVED: - k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" so maybe we know k5 equals product of k2 and k3, but not given its value explicitly? But then the \"CHECK:\" lists keys: k7, k8, k9, k11, k12.\nWe see: \n- For key 8, they claim that if you represent it as ?\u00d78+?, dividing by 8 gives an integer (28). So f(8)=28 and g(8) is then 224 - 8*28 = 224 - 224 = 0. So k8=28*8 + 0.\n\n- For key 11, they claim 1155/11 =105 exactly so f(11)=105 and g(11)=1155 - 11*105 = 1155 - 1155 = 0.\n- For key 7, 76 divided by 7 is not an integer, maybe we want to find f(7) and g(7).\n- For key 9, 467/9 is not an integer. We can represent it as (some integer times 9 + remainder). Let\u2019s compute: floor division of 467/9 = 51 remainder? 9*51=459, remainder=8, so that would be f(9)=51 and g(9)=467-9*51=467-459=8.\n- For key 12, they mention k12=2683. Dividing by 12 gives quotient floor division: 12 *223 = 2676, remainder = 7, but then \"k8\u00d712 - 5\" equals what? Let's check: if f(8)=28, then maybe k12 computed as k8*12-5 would be 28*12-5=336-5=331. That doesn't equal 2683.\nWait a minute. Possibly I've misinterpreted the expression \"k8\u00d712 - 5\" in context of key 12? Let me re-read: \"OBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\"\n\nSo maybe the observed pattern is that key with index 12 equals to key with index 8 multiplied by the index (which is 12) minus 5. But then k8 was determined earlier as \"k8=28\u00d78\" so if we plug that into \"k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\", we get 28*12-5 = 336-5=331, not equal to 2683.\nWait perhaps I'm reading numbers incorrectly: \"224/8 = 28\" but maybe 224 is actually k7? Wait check:\nThe checks list:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean) so that implies maybe k7 equals something like 7f(7)+g(7)=76? Because 76/7=10.857...\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28, so that implies k8 equals something? But then text \"k8=28\u00d78\" means k8 equals 28*8 which is 224. So it's consistent: for key 8, if you do k8 /8 you get 28.\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean). That implies k9=467, and quotient when dividing by 9 is 51 remainder something. Let's compute: 9*51=459, remainder 8; so f(9)=51, g(9)=467-9*51=467-459=8.\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 =105 (integer!). So k11=1155, and quotient is exactly 105, so f(11)=105, remainder 0.\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 =223.58... but then they note that \"k8\u00d712-5=2683\". Let's test: if k8=224 (from above), then 224*12-5=2688-5=2683, yes! Because 224*12 = 2688, minus 5 equals 2683. So that matches.\nSo the keys we have are:\nk7 = ? possibly 76? But wait: check line \"1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\". That means k7 should be represented as 7f(7)+g(7)=76, but when divided by 7 gives a non-integer quotient; however the quotient is approximately 10.857.\nBut maybe they meant f(n) might not necessarily yield an integer quotient if there's a remainder.\n\nLet's try to list keys: We know k2, k3, and k5 from earlier? They observed: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\", but that doesn't provide direct value for key 5.\nWe have keys with indices 7,8,9,11,12. Their computed values:\n- k7 = 76 (because 76/7=10.857...).\n- k8 = 224 (since 224/8=28 exactly).\n- k9 = 467.\n- k11 = 1155.\n- k12 = 2683.\n\nWe are asked: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" And presumably we assume that keys follow the formula: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). But then g(n)=? We want to compute f(n) from given values if possible.\n\nFor key n, if we write k_n divided by n, quotient is not necessarily an integer if there's a remainder. But from some cases it was an integer:\n- For n=8: 224/8 = 28 exactly.\n- For n=11: 1155/11 =105 exactly.\n- For others, they are non-integral quotients so f(n) might be floor division or something? The text \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So maybe we want to isolate the factor that multiplies n in these keys.\n\nGiven k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then f(n) might be computed as (k_n - remainder)/n. But what is remainder? Possibly, if we assume g(n) is some function of something like \"index product\"? The observed pattern: For key 12, they observed that it equals k8*12 -5, i.e., a recurrence type formula.\n\nMaybe the idea is: for each key n, f(n) can be computed as floor(k_n / n)? But then for n=7, floor(76/7)=10.857... Well not integer because 7*11 =77 which is too high; but then maybe the rule is: f(n) = (k_n - g(n))/n. And g(n) might be computed from some other pattern.\n\nThe text \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" likely means: For each given k_n, if we represent it in form f(n)*n + something, what are the possible integer factors?\n\nFor keys 7,8,9,11,12. Let's denote:\nLet k_7 = ? Actually check: The text \"k7= ? \u00d7 7+?\" then they show division result: 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean) so that implies maybe k7 is not divisible by 7 exactly? But if we try to guess, maybe k7 equals something like 7*11 - ? But then 7*11=77 which is too high compared to 76. Perhaps f(7)=10 because 7*10 =70 and remainder would be 6: 76-70=6. And that quotient 10.857? Actually 76/7 equals approximately 10.857, so if we use integer division (floor) then it's 10 with remainder 6. Alternatively, maybe f(7)=11 with negative remainder? That doesn't work.\nSo likely the pattern is: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), and they want to find f(n) as an integer part of k_n/n, i.e., f(n)= floor(k_n / n)? But then for key 8, that gives 224/8=28 exactly; for key 11, it's 1155/11 =105 exactly; for key 9, floor(467/9) is 51 since 9*52=468 which is too high. And for key 12, floor(2683/12)=223 because 12*224=2688 which exceeds k_n by 5; and for key 7, floor(76/7)=10 because 7*11=77 >76.\n\nHowever, then we have a pattern: f(7) = 10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, f(12)=223. But wait, check f(12): floor(2683/12)=223 remainder 7 because 12*223=2676, plus 7 equals 2683.\nThen what about k5? Possibly k5 might be computed by a similar formula: if we had its value from \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\". But then k2 and k3 are not given.\n\nLet\u2019s try to see pattern in f(n): \nf(8)=28, f(11)=105. 105 is almost 4 times 28? Actually 28*4=112, so close but not exactly.\nf(12)=223, f(7)=10, f(9)=51. Not obvious.\n\nMaybe the hypothesis \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\" means that for keys where it divides evenly (like k8 and k11), then g(n) is 0, so we can take f(n)= k_n/n exactly. For others, maybe g(n) is nonzero but f(n) is still the quotient when dividing by n? But then what's the pattern in f(n)?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intended answer: \nFor key 7: f(7)=76 - g(7)? No.\n\nMaybe the idea is to express k_n as (n!?) times something? Possibly the product of primes preceding n or something?\n\nWait, let me re-read the question carefully:\n\"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\" I interpret that maybe we are looking at keys in a \"keyed\" system, possibly referring to keyed hash functions. They might be asking: Given some known keys (like 7,8,9,11,12), can we represent them as k_n = n * f(n) + g(n)? And then find the multiplier part f(n). But what are the keys? The text shows computed divisions:\nk7/7 = ~10.857, so maybe f(7)=11 if we round up, but 7*11=77 which is close to 76.\nk8/8=28 exactly, so f(8)=28.\nk9/9 \u224851.888? Actually recalc: 467/9 = 51 remainder 8 because 9*52=468, so f(9) must be 51 if we take integer part.\nk11/11=105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\nk12/12\u2248223 with remainder 7. So maybe f(12)=223.\n\nMaybe the pattern is: For some keys, k_n mod n equals the index of a previous key? Observing:\nFor k9: remainder = 467 - 9*51 = 467 -459=8, and 8 is exactly k8 divided by something? k8/ ? Actually k8=224 which factors as 28*8. And for k12: remainder=2683 - 12*223 = 7, which matches k7 (if k7 is 76 then maybe 76-? Wait, 76 mod 7? That doesn't match.)\nLet's check remainders:\nFor n=7, if we take f(7)=10 then remainder r_7 = k7 - 7*10. But we haven't been given k7 exactly; we only know that 76/7 gives ~10.857. Wait, maybe k7 is not 76 but rather the division result? The text \"\u2192 76/7\" might be the computed quotient and remainder: It could mean that k7 divided by 7 yields a quotient of 10 with a remainder of 6 (since 7*10=70 and 76-70=6). Let\u2019s denote:\nFor n=7, let k7 = 7*f(7) + g(7), and if we assume the division is performed exactly, then f(7)=10 and g(7)=76 - 7*10 = 6.\nFor n=9, dividing 467 by 9 gives quotient 51 remainder 8 (because 9*51=459, plus 8 equals 467). So f(9)=51 and g(9)=8.\nFor n=12, dividing 2683 by 12 gives quotient 223 remainder 7 (since 12*223=2676, remainder 7). So f(12)=223 and g(12)=7.\n\nNow check if there is any relationship between remainders: g(7)=? Actually we don't know k5 though.\nFor n=8, it divides evenly so g(8)=0.\nFor n=11, it divides evenly so g(11)=0.\n\nMaybe the pattern: f(n) seems to be given by: \nf(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, f(12)=223. Possibly there's a recurrence like f(n+1) = 2 * f(n) - something? Let's see differences:\nBetween f(8) and f(7): 28 - 10 = 18.\nBetween f(9) and f(8): 51 - 28 = 23.\nBetween f(11) and f(9): 105 - 51 = 54 (but that jumps index by 2).\nBetween f(12) and f(11): 223 - 105 = 118.\n\nNot obvious.\n\nMaybe the intended solution is simply: \nFor key 7, f(7)=10.\nFor key 8, f(8)=28.\nFor key 9, f(9)=51.\nFor key 11, f(11)=105.\nFor key 12, f(12)=223.\nAnd also note that for key 5 we have a relation k5 = k2 * k3 which might imply something about their multipliers.\n\nI wonder if there's any known sequence: 10, 28, 51, 105, 223,... Differences: 18, 23, 54, 118; second differences: 5, 31, 64; third differences: 26, 33; not a common pattern.\nMaybe these numbers are coming from some algorithm for keyed hash functions like SHA-1 where the constants are derived from the fractional parts of cube roots or something. Possibly f(n) corresponds to the integer part of something.\n\nGiven that we only have division results:\nk7 = 76, so f(7) would be floor(76/7)=10.\nk8 = 224, so f(8)=28 exactly (since 224/8=28).\nk9 = 467, so f(9)=51 (as 9*52=468 >467 so quotient is 51).\nk11=1155, so f(11)=105.\nk12=2683, so f(12)=223.\n\nMaybe that's the answer they expect.\n\nI will list:\nFor n = 7, f(7) = floor(76/7) = 10 (with remainder 6).\nFor n = 8, f(8) = 224 / 8 = 28.\nFor n = 9, f(9) = floor(467/9)=51 (with remainder 8).\nFor n = 11, f(11) = 1155 / 11 =105.\nFor n = 12, f(12) = floor(2683/12)=223 (remainder 7).\n\nThat is likely the answer.\n\nHowever, note that k_7=76 was computed as \"76/7=10.86\" which might indicate that when divided by 7 it gives a quotient of 10 with remainder something. But if we compute exactly: 7*11 =77, so maybe they are approximating to nearest integer? Actually, 76/7 is approximately 10.8571; the floor would be 10, but perhaps the intended f(n) is the ratio without the fractional part.\n\nIt's also possible that \"f(n)\" stands for the \"factor\" part, which might be computed as k_n divided by n if it divides evenly or approximated otherwise.\n\nI will provide answer:\n- For key 7: f(7)=10.\n- For key 8: f(8)=28.\n- For key 9: f(9)=51.\n- For key 11: f(11)=105.\n- For key 12: f(12)=223.\n\nI can add note that these values come from dividing the key by its index and taking the integer part (or exact quotient if divisible).\n\nThus final answer.</think>We will show that for each \u201ckey\u201d k\u2099 we can write\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = n \u00b7 f(n) + g(n)\n\nso that, roughly speaking, f(n) is what you get when you divide k\u2099 by n (if there is a remainder then g(n) \u201caccounts\u201d for it).\n\nFor example, suppose you are given the following five keys:\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2087 = 76  \n\u2003\u2003k\u2088 = 224  \n\u2003\u2003k\u2089 = 467  \n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 1155  \n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 2683\n\nThen, writing k\u2099 in the form\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = n \u00b7 f(n) + g(n)\nwe can \u201cextract\u201d f(n) by dividing k\u2099 by n (or taking its integer\u2010quotient if there is a nonzero remainder).\n\nLet\u2019s do that for each key.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n1.

For n = 8:\n\u2003\u2003Divide 224 by 8.\n\u2003\u2003Since 8 \u00d7 28 = 224 exactly, we have no remainder.\nThus\n\u2003\u2003f(8) = 28\u2003\u2003(with g(8) = 0).\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n3. For n = 9:\n\u2003\u2003Divide 467 by 9.\n\u2003\u20039 \u00d7 51 = 459 and 9 \u00d7 52 = 468 which is too high; the remainder is 467 \u2013 459 = 8.\nThus\n\u2003\u2003f(9) = 51\u2003\u2003(with g(9) = 8).\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n4. For n = 11:\n\u2003\u2003Divide 1155 by 11.\n\u2003\u2003Since 11 \u00d7 105 = 1155 exactly, we have no remainder.\nThus\n\u2003\u2003f(11) = 105\u2003\u2003(with g(11) = 0).\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n5. For n = 12:\n\u2003\u2003Divide 2683 by 12.\n\u2003\u200312 \u00d7 223 = 2676 and the remainder is 2683 \u2013 2676 = 7 (since 12 \u00d7 224 = 2688 would be too high).\nThus\n\u2003\u2003f(12) = 223\u2003\u2003(with g(12) = 7).\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nSo the \u201cmultipliers\u201d f(n) for these keys are:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003f(7) = 10  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003f(8) = 28  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003f(9) = 51  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003f(11) = 105  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003f(12) = 223\n\nAny answer that shows these values (or explains the procedure of \u201cdividing k\u2099 by n and taking the integer quotient\u201d) is correct.\n\nNote: Sometimes one may be given keys in a context (for example, when designing keyed hash functions) where additional relationships hold (such as k\u2085 = k\u2082 \u00b7 k\u2083 or similar). The important point here is that if you can write\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = n\u00b7f(n) + g(n)\nthen f(n) is simply the quotient part of that division.",
