  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we're dealing with something called \"square root pattern analysis\" for these keys k5, k6, up to k16. The user has given some observed values and wants to check if there are other square-based formulas. Let me parse the information given first.\n\nStarting with the observed value: k13 = k7\u00b2 - 11 = 5776 - 11 = 5765. Wait, hold on, 76 squared is 5776, so k7 must be 76. Then they subtract 11 to get k13 as 5765. Interesting. So that's a square-based formula for k13.\n\nThen they list several square roots of other keys:\n\n1. \u221ak5 \u2248 4.58 (not integer)\n2. \u221ak6 = 7 (which is k3, so k6 = k3\u00b2)\n3. \u221ak8 \u224814.97 (close to 15)\n4. \u221ak11\u224833.98 (close to 34)\n5. \u221ak13\u224875.93 (close to k7=76)\n6. \u221ak14\u2248102.68\n\nSo, the task is to see if there are similar square-based formulas for k14, k15, k16, especially trying to find patterns like k13 is close to k7 squared minus a small constant. Let's start by listing what we know and see if we can find more relationships.\n\nFirst, let me note down the keys where we have information:\n\n- k3 is 7 because \u221ak6 is 7, so k6 = 7\u00b2 = 49. So k3 must be 7.\n\n- k7 is 76, since \u221ak13 \u224875.93 is very close to 76, and indeed 76\u00b2 is 5776, which when subtracted 11 gives k13=5765.\n\n- k5: \u221ak5 \u22484.58, so k5 is approximately 21 (since 4.58 squared is around 21). The problem states that \u221ak5 is not an integer, so k5 is 21? Wait, but they wrote \"\u221ak5 = \u221a21 \u22484.58\", so k5 must be 21? Let me check that.\n\nWait, the problem says \"OBSERVED: k13 = k7\u00b2 - 11 = 5776 - 11 = 5765\". So that's given. Then in the list of square roots, for k5 it's sqrt(21) \u22484.58. So I think they are telling us that k5 is 21? Because they use sqrt(k5)=sqrt(21). So maybe all keys are numbered, like k1, k2,... up to k16, each with some value. But we only have specific values for some of them. So perhaps we need to assume that the keys are in sequence and their values might be following some pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are part of a sequence where each k_n is defined based on previous terms. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the given information:\n\n- k6 = k3\u00b2, so if k3 is 7, then k6 is 49. That's straightforward.\n\n- k13 = k7\u00b2 - 11. Since k7 is 76, then 76\u00b2 is 5776, minus 11 gives 5765, so k13 is 5765.\n\nLooking at the square roots of other keys:\n\n- \u221ak8 \u224814.97, close to 15. So maybe k8 is close to 15\u00b2=225. But the problem says \"close to 15!\" (with an exclamation, maybe they mean factorial? Wait 15! is 1307674368000 which is way too big, so probably not. Maybe just close to 15). The problem says \u221ak8 is \u224814.97, so k8 is about 14.97\u00b2\u2248224. So k8 is 224? Let me check: the problem actually says \"\u221ak8 = \u221a224 \u224814.97\". Wait, hold on, maybe they are telling us the value of k8? Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem lists:\n\n\"CHECK EACH:\n\n1. \u221ak5 = \u221a21 \u2248 4.58 (not integer)\n2. \u221ak6 = \u221a49 = 7 = k3 \u2713 (k6 = k3\u00b2)\n3. \u221ak8 = \u221a224 \u2248 14.97 (not integer, but close to 15!)\n4. \u221ak11 = \u221a1155 \u2248 33.98 (close to 34!)\n5. \u221ak13 = \u221a5765 \u2248 75.93 (close to k7=76!)\n6. \u221ak14 = \u221a10544 \u2248 102.68\"\n\nWait, so actually, they have already computed the square roots for each key. For example, k5 is 21 because sqrt(k5)=sqrt(21). Similarly, k6 is 49 (since sqrt(49)=7=k3), k8 is 224 (since sqrt(224)\u224814.97), k11 is 1155 (since sqrt(1155)\u224833.98), k13 is 5765 (sqrt\u224875.93), and k14 is 10544 (sqrt\u2248102.68). So, perhaps each key k_n has a value given here? Wait, but the problem says \"OBSERVED: k13 = k7\u00b2 - 11 = 5776 - 11 = 5765\". So maybe k7 is 76 (since 76\u00b2 is 5776), so that's given. But then they are telling us that k13 is 5765. So the keys' values are given here? Let me parse this again.\n\nWait, in the first line, OBSERVED: k13 is given as 5765, which is equal to k7 squared minus 11. Since k7 squared is 76\u00b2=5776, so subtracting 11 gives 5765. So that's a formula for k13.\n\nThen in the \"CHECK EACH\" list, they are showing the square roots of other keys. So for example, k5 is 21 (since sqrt(21)\u22484.58), k6 is 49 (sqrt is 7, which is k3), so that formula is k6=k3\u00b2. Similarly, k8 is 224 (sqrt\u224814.97, close to 15). So they are saying that sqrt(k8) is close to 15. Similarly sqrt(k11)=sqrt(1155)\u224833.98 close to 34, sqrt(k13)=75.93 close to 76 (which is k7), and sqrt(k14)=\u2248102.68.\n\nThe problem then says:\n\n\"INVESTIGATE:\n\n- Why is \u221ak13 \u2248 k7? Because k13 = k7\u00b2 - 11!\n\n- Is \u221ak14 \u2248 some_key? 102.68...\n\n- If k15 = k8\u00b2 - C, what C makes it in range [16384, 32767]?\n\n224\u00b2 = 50176, so C = 50176 - k15\n\nFind square patterns for k14, k15, k16.\"\n\nSo, they want us to look for similar patterns as k13, which is k7 squared minus 11, but for the other keys. Let me go through each step.\n\nFirst, the first question is why is sqrt(k13) \u2248k7? Because k13 is k7 squared minus 11. So k13 is almost k7 squared, but just 11 less. So sqrt(k13) is sqrt(k7\u00b2 -11)\u2248k7 - some small term. Since sqrt(x\u00b2 - a) \u2248x - a/(2x) for small a. So sqrt(5776-11)=sqrt(5765)= about 75.93, which is indeed close to 76 (k7). So that's explained.\n\nThen, they ask about sqrt(k14)=\u2248102.68. So sqrt(k14)=sqrt(10544)\u2248102.68. So is 102.68 close to another key? Let me see which keys we have:\n\nk3=7, k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224, k11=1155, k13=5765, k14=10544. The keys mentioned so far are up to k14. Maybe the \"some_key\" is k12? Or k9? Let's see. Let me see if 102.68 is close to any key. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the keys given:\n\nk3=7, k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224, k11=1155, k13=5765, k14=10544.\n\nWait, but those are key numbers up to 14. So 102.68 is between 100 and 105, but none of the keys before that are close. Wait, but maybe the key number itself? Like k102? No, that's too far. Alternatively, maybe 102.68 is related to another key's value? Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe we need to see if 102.68 is close to a key number? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's close to another square? Let's see: 102.68 squared is 10544, which is exactly k14. Wait, so sqrt(k14)=sqrt(10544)=~102.68, so that's just the square root. The question is, is 102.68 close to some key? Maybe the key number 10? But we don't know k10. Alternatively, maybe it's part of another formula?\n\nAlternatively, maybe k14 is close to some square minus or plus a small number. For example, 102.68 is close to 103, so 103\u00b2 is 10609. Then, k14 = 103\u00b2 - (10609 -10544)=103\u00b2 -65. Wait 10609-10544=65. So, k14=103\u00b2 -65. But is 103 a key? Not sure. Alternatively, 102 squared is 10404, so 102\u00b2 + (10544-10404)= 102\u00b2 +140. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern between k7 and k14? Let me see: k7 is 76, and 76*1.35\u2248102.6. Wait, 76*1.35 is 102.6, which is close to sqrt(k14)=102.68. Maybe k14 is related to k7 in some way? Maybe k14 = (k7 * 1.35)^2? But that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a sequence where each term is a square minus some constant.\n\nNext part: \"If k15 = k8\u00b2 - C, what C makes it in range [16384, 32767]? 224\u00b2 = 50176, so C = 50176 - k15\".\n\nWait, they want to define k15 as k8 squared minus some constant C, such that k15 is between 16384 and 32767. Since k8 is 224, so k8 squared is 224\u00b2=50176. So k15 would be 50176 - C, and they want k15 to be in that range. So to get k15 between 16384 and 32767, then 16384 \u2264 50176 - C \u226432767. So solving for C:\n\nFirst inequality: 50176 - C \u226516384 \u2192 C \u226450176 -16384 = 33792\n\nSecond inequality: 50176 - C \u226432767 \u2192 C \u226550176 -32767 = 17409\n\nTherefore, C must be between 17409 and 33792. But the question is asking \"what C makes it in range [16384,32767]\". So any C between 17409 and 33792 will do. But maybe they want a specific C? The problem might be expecting a pattern similar to k13 =k7\u00b2 -11. So perhaps C is a small number? But 17409 is quite big. Alternatively, maybe C is related to another key?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a pattern where each key is the square of the previous key minus some constant. But let me think again. Let's see if there is a pattern in the given keys:\n\nLooking at the keys we have:\n\nk3=7,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nk11=1155,\n\nk13=5765,\n\nk14=10544.\n\nHmm, not sure about the sequence here. The keys are numbered irregularly, like from k3, k5, k6, k7, etc., so maybe the key numbers themselves have some significance? Alternatively, the values have a pattern. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the values:\n\nk3=7,\n\nk5=21 (which is 3*7),\n\nk6=49 (which is 7\u00b2),\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224 (which is 76*2.947\u2026), not sure,\n\nk11=1155,\n\nk13=5765,\n\nk14=10544.\n\nHmm, maybe the values are following some multiplicative pattern?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the square roots:\n\nsqrt(k5)=sqrt(21)\u22484.58,\n\nsqrt(k6)=7,\n\nsqrt(k8)=\u224814.97 (close to 15),\n\nsqrt(k11)=\u224833.98 (close to 34),\n\nsqrt(k13)=\u224875.93 (close to 76),\n\nsqrt(k14)=\u2248102.68.\n\nNotice that each sqrt(k_n) is roughly doubling? Let's see:\n\nsqrt(k3)=sqrt(7)\u22482.64 (but k3 itself is 7, but not sure if sqrt is considered here),\n\nsqrt(k5)=~4.58,\n\nsqrt(k6)=7 (doubles from 4.58 to 7? Not quite),\n\nsqrt(k8)=~14.97 (approximately doubles 7 to 14.97),\n\nsqrt(k11)=~33.98 (doubles 14.97 to ~30, close),\n\nsqrt(k13)=~75.93 (doubles ~34 to ~70),\n\nsqrt(k14)=~102.68 (doesn't quite double from 76, but 76*1.35\u2248102.6). So maybe there's a pattern where each sqrt(k_n) is roughly multiplying by ~1.5 or something, but not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the approximate sqrt values:\n\nk3: 2.64,\n\nk5: 4.58,\n\nk6:7,\n\nk8:15,\n\nk11:34,\n\nk13:76,\n\nk14:103.\n\nWait, if we look at the sqrt values rounded:\n\nk3:3,\n\nk5:5,\n\nk6:7,\n\nk8:15,\n\nk11:34,\n\nk13:76,\n\nk14:103.\n\nWait, that seems like roughly multiplying by 2 or adding something. From 3 to5 (+2), 5 to7 (+2), 7 to 15 (+8), 15 to34 (+19), 34 to76 (+42), 76 to103 (+27). Not obvious. Alternatively, the sqrt(k_n) numbers are 3,5,7,15,34,76,103. Hmm, maybe each term is the previous multiplied by some factor:\n\n3*1.666\u2026=5,\n\n5*1.4=7,\n\n7*2.14=15,\n\n15*2.266=34,\n\n34*2.235=76,\n\n76*1.355=103.\n\nHmm, not a clear pattern. Alternatively, maybe the sqrt(k_n) terms correspond to some sequence like Fibonacci or something? Let's see: 3,5,7,15,34,76,103. Not Fibonacci.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these sqrt values are related to the key numbers:\n\nsqrt(k3)=sqrt(7)\u22482.64, key number 3,\n\nsqrt(k5)=sqrt(21)\u22484.58, key number5,\n\nsqrt(k6)=7, key number6,\n\nsqrt(k8)=\u224814.97, key number8,\n\nsqrt(k11)=\u224833.98, key number11,\n\nsqrt(k13)=\u224875.93, key number13,\n\nsqrt(k14)=\u2248102.68, key number14.\n\nHmm, sqrt(k_n) is roughly (key number)*something? Let's see:\n\nFor k3: 3*0.88\u22482.64,\n\nk5:5*0.916\u22484.58,\n\nk6:6*1.166\u22487,\n\nk8:8*1.87\u224814.96,\n\nk11:11*3.09\u224834,\n\nk13:13*5.84\u224875.9,\n\nk14:14*7.33\u2248102.6.\n\nNot a clear pattern here either.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the keys and their positions:\n\nk3=7,\n\nk5=21 (3*7),\n\nk6=49 (7\u00b2),\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224 (76*2.947),\n\nk11=1155,\n\nk13=5765,\n\nk14=10544.\n\nHmm, perhaps some of these are factorial? 7 is 7, 21 is 7*3, 49 is 7\u00b2, 76 is 7*10 + 6, not sure. Alternatively, maybe these numbers relate to previous keys:\n\nk3=7,\n\nk5=3*7,\n\nk6=7\u00b2,\n\nk7=7*10 +6,\n\nk8=224= 7*32,\n\nk11=1155= 224*5 + 35,\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the differences between keys:\n\nFrom k3 to k5 (positions 3 to5): difference in keys is 2, difference in values is 14 (21-7),\n\nk5 to k6 (5 to6): difference in keys is1, difference in values 28 (49-21),\n\nk6 to k7 (6 to7): difference 1, difference 27 (76-49),\n\nk7 to k8 (7 to8): difference1, difference148 (224-76),\n\nk8 to k11 (8 to11): difference3, difference 931 (1155-224),\n\nk11 to k13 (11 to13): difference2, difference4610 (5765-1155),\n\nk13 to k14 (13 to14): difference1, difference4779 (10544-5765).\n\nThese differences don't seem to follow a pattern either. Maybe another approach.\n\nThe problem mentions \"Find square patterns for k14, k15, k16\". So perhaps each of these keys can be expressed as a square minus some constant, similar to how k13 is k7 squared minus 11.\n\nLooking at k14=10544. Let's see if that is close to a square. The square root is ~102.68. So 103 squared is 10609. So 10609-10544=65. So k14=103\u00b2 -65.\n\nAlternatively, 102 squared is 10404, so 10544-10404=140, so k14=102\u00b2 +140.\n\nBut maybe 65 is a number related to another key? Let's see the keys:\n\nk3=7, k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224, k11=1155, k13=5765, k14=10544.\n\nHmm, 65 is between k7=76 and k8=224, but not sure. Alternatively, 65 is 5*13, but not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if there is a pattern with the constants subtracted:\n\nFor k13, the constant is 11 (k7 squared minus 11). Maybe the constants are following some sequence? Let's see:\n\nIf k13 is 76\u00b2 -11=5776 -11=5765, which matches.\n\nIf k14 is 103\u00b2 -65=10609-65=10544, which matches.\n\nThen maybe the constants 11 and 65 are part of a sequence? 11, 65, maybe next one?\n\nAlternatively, the constants could be following their own pattern. 11 to 65 is +54. Maybe next is 65 + something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the constants are related to previous keys:\n\nFor k13, the constant 11: 11 is a prime number. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the constant for k14 is 65, which is 5*13. Hmm, 13 is the key number of k13.\n\nWait, maybe the constant is the key number minus something? For k13, key number is13, so 13 vs 11. Not directly.\n\nAlternatively, the constants could be related to the differences between keys. For example, the difference between k14 and k13 is 10544-5765=4779. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the constants are being added instead? Let's see, but in k13's case it was subtracted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each key is the square of the previous key's square root minus some constant. Let me see:\n\nFor example, sqrt(k13) \u224875.93, which is close to k7=76. So k13= (k7)^2 -11.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(k14)=\u2248102.68, which is close to 103. So maybe k14= (103)^2 -65, where 103 is the next number after 76? But how does 103 relate to previous keys?\n\nAlternatively, 103 is the square root of k14 rounded up. But maybe the pattern is that each key is the square of the previous sqrt rounded to nearest integer minus some constant.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the keys as following a pattern where each key is roughly double the previous key? Let's see:\n\nk3=7,\n\nk5=21 (3x),\n\nk6=49 (2.3x),\n\nk7=76 (1.55x),\n\nk8=224 (2.95x),\n\nk11=1155 (5.16x),\n\nk13=5765 (5x),\n\nk14=10544 (1.83x).\n\nNot a consistent doubling.\n\nAlternatively, the keys are following a polynomial or exponential function? Maybe not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the given keys and their positions:\n\nk3=7,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nk11=1155,\n\nk13=5765,\n\nk14=10544.\n\nNotice that k5=3*7,\n\nk6=7\u00b2,\n\nk7=7*10+6,\n\nk8=224= 7*32,\n\nk11=1155= 11*105,\n\nk13=5765=13*443.46 (not integer),\n\nk14=10544=14*753.14.\n\nHmm, k5=3*7 (key number 3 times value at k3),\n\nk6=7\u00b2 (square of k3),\n\nk8=7*32 (but 32 is not a key number),\n\nk11=11*105 (maybe 105 is related to previous keys? 105= 1155/11),\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps k_n = n * something,\n\nk3=3*2.333,\n\nk5=5*4.2,\n\nk6=6*8.166,\n\nk7=7*10.857,\n\nk8=8*28,\n\nk11=11*105,\n\nk13=13*443.46,\n\nk14=14*753.14.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are related to the number of the key in some combinatorial way, like combinations or permutations.\n\nAlternatively, think of the keys as part of a sequence where each term is defined by previous terms. For example, maybe k14 is k13 + k8 or something?\n\nk14=10544 vs k13=5765 +k8=224 \u2192 5765+224=5989 \u226010544.\n\nAlternatively, k14= k11 +k8= 1155+224=1379\u226010544.\n\nAlternatively, k14= 2*k13 + something? 2*5765=11530, which is close but not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers might be part of a known sequence. Let me check OEIS for some of these numbers:\n\nLooking up 7,21,49,76,224,1155,5765,10544.\n\nChecking 7,21,49,76,224,1155,5765,10544:\n\n- 7 is a prime.\n\n-21 is triangular number (3rd), hexagonal number, etc.\n\n-49 is 7 squared,\n\n-76 is 19*4,\n\n-224 is 2^5 *7,\n\n-1155 is 3\u00d75\u00d77\u00d711,\n\n-5765 factors into 5 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 67,\n\n-10544 is 8 \u00d7 1318.\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these numbers are related to the number of certain objects in combinatorics, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. The question says \"Find square patterns for k14, k15, k16\". Maybe each of these can be expressed as a square minus some constant, similar to k13.\n\nGiven that k13 = (k7)^2 - 11, where 76^2 is 5776, 5776-11=5765.\n\nSo maybe k14 can be expressed as (something)^2 - (something else).\n\nGiven that sqrt(k14)=sqrt(10544)\u2248102.68, so the closest squares are 102\u00b2=10404 and 103\u00b2=10609.\n\n10544-10404=140, so 102\u00b2 +140=10544,\n\nOr 103\u00b2-65=10609-65=10544.\n\nSo either way.\n\nIf following the pattern of k13: (previous key's value)^2 minus a constant,\n\nWait, k13 is (k7)^2 -11,\n\nSo maybe k14 is (k8)^2 minus something?\n\nk8 is 224, so 224 squared is 50176, which is way bigger than 10544. Not likely.\n\nAlternatively, using the square of the previous key's square root?\n\nsqrt(k13)=\u224875.93, so 76^2 -11,\n\nsqrt(k14)=\u2248102.68, so 103^2 -65,\n\nThen maybe the next term k15 would be (103 + something)^2 minus next constant.\n\nAlternatively, the constants subtracted are 11, 65, maybe the differences between constants: 65-11=54, next difference could be 54+ something?\n\nAlternatively, constants could be following a sequence like 11, 65, 129, etc., adding 54 each time? 11+54=65, 65+54=119, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the constants are related to the key numbers:\n\nFor k13 (key13): 13, the constant is 11 (13-2),\n\nFor k14 (key14): the constant is 65 (14* something? 14*4.64).\n\nNot obvious.\n\nAlternatively, the constants could be related to the previous constants:\n\n11 and 65: 65 is 11*5 + 20? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the constants might be primes? 11 is prime, 65 is not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the constants are the key numbers multiplied by something:\n\n11 is key13: 13*0.846,\n\n65 is key14*4.64.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the next constant is key15's value?\n\nBut this is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different pattern. The key numbers are 3,5,6,7,8,11,13,14. There's a gap between 8 and11, then 11 to13, then14. Maybe the pattern is primes? Not exactly, because 14 is not prime.\n\nAlternatively, the positions are increasing by 2, then1, then1, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the keys correspond to the numbers where the value is a multiple of the key number:\n\nk3=7 (not multiple of3),\n\nk5=21 (multiple of5),\n\nk6=49 (not multiple of6),\n\nk7=76 (not multiple of7),\n\nk8=224 (multiple of8),\n\nk11=1155 (multiple of11),\n\nk13=5765 (multiple of13),\n\nk14=10544 (multiple of14).\n\nAh! This seems promising.\n\nCheck:\n\nk5=21 is divisible by5? 21/5=4.2, no. Wait 21 is divisible by 3 and7, but not by5.\n\nWait k8=224 divided by8 is28, yes.\n\nk11=1155 divided by11 is105, yes.\n\nk13=5765 divided by13 is 5765/13=443.4615..., wait that's not an integer. Wait 13*443=5759, 13*444=5772, so no, that's not.\n\nWait 5765 divided by13: 13*443=5759, 5765-5759=6, so remainder 6. Not divisible.\n\nHmm, so k13 is not divisible by13.\n\nk14=10544 divided by14 is753.142..., which is 10544/14=753.142..., so not integer.\n\nHmm, so that idea is incorrect except for k8 and k11.\n\nWait maybe the keys where the value is divisible by the key number are at positions 5,8,11,14? Let's check:\n\nk5=21: 21/5=4.2, no,\n\nk8=224/8=28, yes,\n\nk11=1155/11=105, yes,\n\nk14=10544/14=753.14..., no.\n\nHmm inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the values are multiples of previous keys?\n\nk5=21=3*7=k3*3,\n\nk6=49=k3\u00b2,\n\nk7=76= maybe k6+27,\n\nk8=224= k7+148,\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be expecting an answer where each term is the square of the previous term minus some number, but starting from somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that each key is the previous key multiplied by some factor:\n\nk3=7,\n\nk5=21 (7*3),\n\nk6=49 (7\u00b2),\n\nk7=76 (49+27),\n\nk8=224 (76*3 -4),\n\nk11=1155 (224*5 + 55),\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, since the user mentioned \"square patterns\", maybe each key's value is a square number minus something:\n\nk3=7= 3\u00b2 - 2,\n\nk5=21= 5\u00b2 - 4,\n\nk6=49=7\u00b2,\n\nk7=76= 8\u00b2 +12,\n\nk8=224=15\u00b2 - 1,\n\nk11=1155=34\u00b2 - 1,\n\nWait 34\u00b2=1156, so 1156-1=1155,\n\nk13=5765= 75\u00b2 + 100 (75\u00b2=5625 +100=5725, no),\n\nAlternatively, sqrt(5765)=75.93,\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, k11=1155= 11\u00b2*10 - 5,\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, the squares might be related to the key numbers:\n\nk3=7= (3+2)^2 - 8,\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference between terms:\n\nFrom k3=7 to k5=21: difference 14 over 2 keys,\n\nk5 to k6: +28 over1 key,\n\nk6 to k7:+27 over1,\n\nk7 to k8:+148 over1,\n\nk8 to k11:+931 over3 keys,\n\nk11 to k13:+4610 over2 keys,\n\nk13 to k14:+4779 over1 key,\n\nThese differences don't show a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, think of the keys as part of a Fibonacci-like sequence, but no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys correspond to the number of the key in some other way, like the number of letters in the word or something, but that's too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a simple continuation of the pattern observed in k13.\n\nGiven that k13 is (previous key value)^2 minus something,\n\nWait k13 is 13th key, but the previous key is k11=1155? Not sure.\n\nWait the keys are at positions 3,5,6,7,8,11,13,14. The sequence of key numbers is 3,5,6,7,8,11,13,14. The pattern of key numbers: increases by 2 (3 to5), then +1, +1, +1, +3, +2, +1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the key numbers are primes or something, but 6,8,14 are not primes.\n\nAlternatively, it's possible that the user is referring to the problem's keys as terms in a sequence, and the question is to find expressions for the next terms (k15, k16) in terms of squares, following the pattern of k13= (k7)^2 -11.\n\nWait if k13 is defined as (k7)^2 minus 11,\n\nThen maybe k14 is (k8)^2 minus something,\n\nk8 is 224, so 224 squared is 50176,\n\nIf we subtract something to get 10544,\n\n50176 - x =10544 \u2192 x=50176-10544=39632. That seems too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the square of the previous term's square root,\n\nk13 is sqrt(5765)=~75.93, so 76\u00b2 -11=5765,\n\nSimilarly, k14 is sqrt(10544)=~102.68, so 103\u00b2 -65=10609-65=10544,\n\nFollowing this, the next term k15 would be (103 +1)^2 minus something? Let's see:\n\nIf the pattern is that each term is (previous term's square root rounded up)^2 minus a constant,\n\nThen the constants are 11 and 65, increasing by 54,\n\nSo next would be 65+54=119,\n\nSo (103+1)=104,\n\n104\u00b2 -119=10816 -119=10697,\n\nThus k15=10697,\n\nThen k16 would be 105\u00b2 - (119+54)=?\n\nWait maybe the constants increase by 54 each time,\n\n11, 65 (diff 54), then 119 (diff 54), then 173, etc.\n\nThus,\n\nk15 would be (103+1)^2 - (65+54)=104\u00b2 -119=10816-119=10697,\n\nThen k16 would be (104+1)^2 - (119+54)=105\u00b2 -173=11025-173=10852,\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the constants subtracted are 11, 65, so difference between constants is +54, so next constant is 65 + 54=119,\n\nThus,\n\nk14=103\u00b2 -65,\n\nk15=104\u00b2 -119,\n\nk16=105\u00b2 -173,\n\nThis would be a possible pattern if the user is expecting such a subtraction of increasing constants.\n\nAlternatively, the constants could be following their own pattern: 11 and 65, which are 11, 65 (which is 11*6 -1), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the constants are 11, 65 (11 + 54), 119 (65+54), etc., adding 54 each time.\n\nIf so, then:\n\nk13: 76\u00b2 -11 =5765,\n\nk14:103\u00b2 -65=10544,\n\nk15:130\u00b2 - (65+54=119)=16900 -119=16781,\n\nWait but 103+27=130? Not sure where 27 comes from,\n\nAlternatively, the square roots are increasing by 27? 76 to 103 is +27,\n\nThen next would be 130,\n\n130\u00b2 - (65+54)=16900-119=16781,\n\nThen k15=16781,\n\nSimilarly, k16=157\u00b2 - (119+54)=157\u00b2 -173,\n\nWait 130+27=157,\n\nYes, so each time the base number increases by 27 and the subtracted constant increases by54 (double the 27),\n\nThus,\n\nThe pattern is:\n\nTerm n: (prev_base +27)^2 - (prev_constant +54),\n\nStarting with:\n\nk13: base=76, constant=11,\n\nk14: base=76+27=103, constant=11+54=65,\n\nk15: base=103+27=130, constant=65+54=119,\n\nk16: base=130+27=157, constant=119+54=173,\n\nTherefore,\n\nk15=130\u00b2 -119=16900 -119=16781,\n\nk16=157\u00b2 -173=24649 -173=24476,\n\nBut this requires assuming that the base increases by27 and the subtracted constant increases by54 each time, which is a possible pattern observed from the first two steps.\n\nAlternatively, since 76 to 103 is +27, and 11 to65 is +54 (which is 2*27),\n\nSo the increments are related: the base increases by27, the constant increases by 2*27,\n\nThus continuing,\n\nk15: base=103+27=130, constant=65+54=119,\n\nk16: base=130+27=157, constant=119+54=173,\n\nThus,\n\nk15 =130\u00b2 -119=16900-119=16781,\n\nk16=157\u00b2 -173=24649-173=24476.\n\nAlternatively, the user might have a different pattern in mind, but given the information, this is a possible way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the base is the previous base plus the key's index difference,\n\nFrom k13 to k14: key difference is 1 (14-13=1), but base went from76 to103, difference of27,\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, the base numbers are 76 and103, the difference between them is27,\n\nThe constants are 11 and65, difference54,\n\nSo 27 and54 are multiples of9 and 3,\n\nAlternatively, 27 is 3 cubed, 54 is 3*18,\n\nBut without more data points, it's hard to be certain.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most logical continuation based on the observed pattern between k13 and k14 is:\n\nEach subsequent term is given by (previous base +27)^2 minus (previous constant +54).\n\nThus,\n\nk15 = (103+27)\u00b2 - (65+54) =130\u00b2 -119 =16900\u2212119=16781\n\nk16= (130+27)\u00b2\u2212(119+54)=157\u00b2\u2212173=24649\u2212173=24476\n\nHence, the answers would be 16781 and24476.\n\nBut since the question is to present the thought process and the final answer boxed, perhaps the user expects a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is different. The user might have presented a problem where \"keys\" refer to something else, but the original question isn't fully provided.
