  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence where each term is a linear combination of the two previous terms, like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}. The user has given me the values for k7 and k8, which are 76 and 224 respectively, and wants to know if there are integers a and b that satisfy these equations. They also mentioned trying a recurrence with a constant term c, so maybe I should check that too. \n\nFirst, let me focus on the initial part without the constant. The problem is to solve the system of equations:\n\n1) 76 = 49a + 21b\n\n2) 224 = 76a + 49b\n\nHmm, okay. So I need to solve for a and b here. Let me write these equations more clearly:\n\nEquation 1: 49a + 21b = 76\n\nEquation 2: 76a + 49b = 224\n\nHmm, this is a system of two equations with two variables. To solve this, I can use substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination. Maybe multiply the first equation by something so I can eliminate one variable.\n\nLet me see the coefficients:\n\nFirst equation coefficients are 49 for a and 21 for b.\n\nSecond equation coefficients are 76 for a and 49 for b.\n\nHmm, perhaps multiply equation 1 by 76 and equation 2 by 49 so that the coefficients for a become the same, but that might get messy. Alternatively, maybe subtract some multiple of the equations?\n\nAlternatively, maybe express one variable in terms of the other from the first equation and substitute into the second.\n\nLet me try that. Let me solve equation 1 for a:\n\n49a = 76 - 21b\n\nSo,\n\na = (76 - 21b)/49\n\nHmm, that's a fraction. Maybe plug this into equation 2.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n76a + 49b = 224\n\nReplace a with (76 -21b)/49:\n\n76*( (76 -21b)/49 ) + 49b = 224\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 76*(76 -21b)/49:\n\nThat's (76*76 - 76*21b)/49\n\nSimilarly, the second term is 49b.\n\nSo, putting together:\n\n[ (76*76 - 76*21b)/49 ] + 49b = 224\n\nHmm, let me compute numerator terms first.\n\nFirst term numerator: 76*76 = 5776, and 76*21b is 1596b. So,\n\n(5776 - 1596b)/49 + 49b = 224\n\nLet me write everything over 49 to combine terms:\n\n(5776 - 1596b)/49 + (49b * 49)/49 = (5776 -1596b + 2401b)/49 = 224\n\nWait, no, 49b multiplied by 49 would be 49b *49? Wait no, actually, to get the common denominator of 49, the second term is (49b)*(49/49) ?\n\nWait, actually:\n\nWait, 49b is equal to (49b * 49)/49? Wait no, that's not correct. 49b is just 49b, so to write it over 49, it's (49b *49)/49? That would be 49b *49, which is overcomplicating. Wait, perhaps better to multiply both sides by 49 to eliminate denominators.\n\nYes, that might be better. Let me do that instead.\n\nStarting from:\n\n[ (5776 - 1596b)/49 ] + 49b = 224\n\nMultiply both sides by 49:\n\n5776 -1596b + 49b *49 = 224*49\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 5776\n\nSecond term: -1596b\n\nThird term: 49b*49 = 2401b\n\nFourth term: 224*49. Let me compute that.\n\n224 * 49: 224*50 = 11200, minus 224 = 11200 -224 = 10976.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n5776 -1596b + 2401b = 10976\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-1596b +2401b) = 805b\n\nSo:\n\n5776 +805b =10976\n\nSubtract 5776 from both sides:\n\n805b = 10976 -5776\n\nCompute 10976 -5776:\n\n10976 - 5000 = 5976, then subtract 776 more: 5976 -776 = 5200? Wait, 5776 subtracted from 10976.\n\nWait, 10976 minus 5000 is 5976, but we need to subtract 5776, so 5976 - 776 = 5200?\n\nWait 10976 -5776:\n\n10976\n\n-5776\n\n--------\n\n10976 - 5000 = 5976\n\nThen subtract 776 more: 5976 - 776 = 5200. Wait, yes, 5776 is 5000 +776. So total is 5200.\n\nWait but 5776 + 5200 = 10976? Let me check:\n\n5000 + 776 =5776\n\n5200 +5776 = 10976, yes.\n\nSo 805b =5200\n\nThus, b =5200 /805\n\nLet me compute that fraction.\n\nSimplify 5200 /805.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n5200 \u00f75 = 1040\n\n805 \u00f75 =161\n\nSo 1040 /161. Let's see if this reduces further.\n\n161 factors: 161 divided by 7 is 23, 7*23=161.\n\nCheck if 1040 divisible by 7: 7*148=1036, so 1040-1036=4, so no.\n\nDivisible by 23? 23*45=1035, 1040-1035=5. Not divisible.\n\nSo 1040/161 is the simplified form. That's approximately 6.459... So it's not an integer. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so b is not an integer here. But the question was asking for integer a and b? So that suggests that such integers don't exist?\n\nWait but maybe I made a calculation mistake here. Let me double-check the steps.\n\nStarting again:\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n49a +21b =76\n\nEquation 2:\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nWe solved equation 1 for a:\n\na=(76 -21b)/49\n\nThen substituted into equation 2:\n\n76*( (76-21b)/49 ) +49b =224\n\nMultiply out:\n\n(76^2 - 76*21b)/49 +49b=224\n\n76^2 is 5776, 76*21 is 1596, so:\n\n(5776 -1596b)/49 +49b =224\n\nMultiply both sides by 49:\n\n5776 -1596b +49b*49 =224*49\n\nWait, hold on, here the term 49b is multiplied by 49 when moving over the denominator? Wait, no.\n\nWait, actually, when you have (5776 -1596b)/49 +49b =224, multiplying both sides by 49 gives:\n\n(5776 -1596b) + 49b*49 =224*49\n\nWait, but 49b is the term, so when multiplied by 49, it becomes 49b *49? Wait no, actually, (49b)*(49/49) )? Wait no, sorry, perhaps I messed up here.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me represent the equation again:\n\nOriginal equation after substitution:\n\n[ (5776 -1596b)/49 ] +49b =224\n\nMultiply all terms by 49:\n\n(5776 -1596b) + (49b)*49 =224*49\n\nWait, no, the 49b term is not over 49, so when you multiply by 49, it becomes 49b *49? No, that's incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nLet me denote the equation:\n\nLet me separate the terms:\n\nFirst term: (5776 -1596b)/49\n\nSecond term: 49b\n\nSo when multiplied by 49, the first term becomes (5776 -1596b), the second term becomes 49b *49, and the right side becomes 224*49.\n\nWait, actually, that is correct. Because (49b)*49 comes from multiplying the second term (which is 49b) by 49.\n\nBut that seems wrong because 49b multiplied by 49 would be 49^2 b, which is 2401b, which is a big term.\n\nWait, but 49b is part of the original equation before multiplying by 49. So when you multiply the entire equation by 49, the term 49b becomes 49b *49? That seems overkill. Wait no, actually, the equation is:\n\nThe second term is 49b, so multiplying that by 49 gives 49b *49? Wait, no, no. Let me think of the equation as:\n\nLet me write it again:\n\nThe left side is [(5776 -1596b)/49] + 49b\n\nMultiplying by 49:\n\nLeft side becomes [(5776 -1596b)/49 *49] + [49b *49] ?\n\nWait no, that's not correct. The first term is (5776 -1596b)/49, so multiplying by 49 gives (5776 -1596b). The second term is 49b, so multiplying by 49 gives 49b *49.\n\nWait, that is correct, but that would mean that the second term is 49b *49. Hmm, but that seems like an error because the original equation is [(5776 -1596b)/49] + 49b =224. So when multiplying by 49, it's:\n\n[(5776 -1596b)/49]*49 + (49b)*49 = 224*49\n\nYes, so first term becomes (5776 -1596b), second term becomes 49b *49, so 2401b, and the right side is 224*49=10976.\n\nTherefore, combining the left side:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b =5776 + (2401b -1596b)=5776 +805b =10976\n\nSo 805b =10976-5776=5200\n\nTherefore, b=5200/805 = simplifies to 1040/161 \u22486.4596.\n\nHmm, which is not an integer, so that's a problem. So maybe there are no integer solutions for a and b here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an arithmetic mistake in the calculation?\n\nLet me check 76 squared again:\n\n76*76: 70*70=4900, 70*6*2=840, 6*6=36, so (70+6)^2=70\u00b2+2*70*6+6\u00b2=4900+840+36=5776, that's correct.\n\n76*21: 70*21=1470, 6*21=126, total 1470+126=1596, that's correct.\n\n49*49 is 2401, correct.\n\n224*49: Let me recalculate 224*50=11200, so 224*49=11200-224=10976, correct.\n\n5776 subtracted from 10976: 10976-5776=5200, correct. 5200 divided by 805: 805*6=4830, 5200-4830=370, 805*0.459\u2248370, so yeah, that's about 6.459. Not integer.\n\nHmm, so that suggests there are no integer solutions for a and b? But the problem is asking whether such a recurrence exists, so maybe the answer is no? But maybe I need to check if fractions are allowed? Wait, the user says \"Can you find integer a, b?\"\n\nSo since the problem specifies integers a and b, then since b is not an integer here, then there is no such recurrence with integer coefficients. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in setting up the equations?\n\nWait, let me check the problem again.\n\nThe user says:\n\n\"For k7 =76:\n\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n\nFor k8=224:\n\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\"\n\nWait, so they are saying that k7 is 76, which is a\u00d7k6 + b\u00d7k5? Wait, but wait, hold on. Wait, in a recurrence relation like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} +b\u00d7k_{n-2}, then to get k7, you need k6 and k5. But the user has written the equation as 76 =a\u00d749 +b\u00d721. So perhaps 49 is k6 and 21 is k5?\n\nAssuming that the previous terms are given, but the user hasn't provided the full sequence. Wait, this is a problem. Wait, maybe there is missing information here? The problem says \"Does the sequence follow a recurrence...\", but we are given k7 and k8, but not the prior terms? Wait, hold on. Wait, the user says \"For k7 =76: 76 =a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\". So they must have prior terms where k6 is 49 and k5 is 21?\n\nSo perhaps the sequence before k7 is k5=21, k6=49, and then k7=76, and k8=224. So the problem is, given that, can we find a and b such that the recurrence holds?\n\nYes, so the previous terms are known? So the user is assuming that the prior terms are 21 and 49 for k5 and k6. So given that, then the equations are correct as set up.\n\nTherefore, since the solution for a and b is non-integer, then the answer is no? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system can be solved with fractions, but the user wants integer coefficients. So then, the answer would be no. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if there is a different approach. Let me try solving the system again, but maybe with elimination.\n\nTake the two equations:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me try to eliminate a variable.\n\nLet me multiply equation1 by 76 and equation2 by 49, then subtract to eliminate a?\n\nWait:\n\nEquation1*76: 49*76 a +21*76 b =76*76\n\nEquation2*49:76*49 a +49*49 b =224*49\n\nSubtract equation1*76 - equation2*49:\n\n[49*76a -76*49a] + [21*76b -49*49b] =76\u00b2 -224*49\n\nThe first term cancels out (49*76a -76*49a =0)\n\nSecond term: 21*76b -49\u00b2b = b*(21*76 -49\u00b2)\n\nRight side:76\u00b2 -224*49\n\nCompute:\n\nLeft side:\n\n21*76 = 21*(70+6)=21*70 +21*6=1470+126=1596\n\n49\u00b2=2401\n\nSo 1596 -2401 = -805\n\nRight side:\n\n76\u00b2=5776, 224*49=10976\n\nThus 5776 -10976 = -5200\n\nThus, equation: -805*b = -5200 \u2192 b= (-5200)/(-805)=5200/805= same as before 1040/161\u22486.459\n\nSame result. So no integer solution.\n\nAlternatively, trying to eliminate b.\n\nMultiply equation1 by49 and equation2 by21:\n\nEquation1*49:49\u00b2a +21*49b =76*49\n\nEquation2*21:76*21a +49*21 b =224*21\n\nSubtract equation1*49 - equation2*21:\n\n(49\u00b2a -76*21a) + (21*49b -49*21b)=76*49 -224*21\n\nThe b terms cancel.\n\nCompute a terms:\n\n49\u00b2a -76*21a =a*(49\u00b2 -76*21)\n\n49\u00b2=2401, 76*21=1596\n\n2401-1596=805\n\nRight side:76*49 -224*21\n\n76*49=3724, 224*21=4704\n\n3724-4704= -980\n\nThus:\n\n805a= -980 \u2192a= -980/805= divide numerator and denominator by 5: -196/161= -28*7/(23*7)= -28/23\u2248-1.217.\n\nHmm, so a= -28/23, b=1040/161. Neither are integers, so no solution in integers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, there are no integer coefficients a and b such that the recurrence holds. Therefore, the sequence does not follow a linear recurrence of order 2 with integer coefficients.\n\nBut the problem says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So the answer is no. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows a and b to be fractions? But the question specifies integers. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the given numbers? If the user intended different prior terms, but since they provided the equations, I have to go with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check with another approach. Suppose we consider the ratio between the equations.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\n49a +21b =76 --> divide by 7:7a +3b =76/7 \u224810.857, but 76 isn't divisible by 7. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, write equations as:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me write this as a matrix:\n\n[49 21 |76]\n\n[76 49 |224]\n\nCompute the determinant: 49*49 -21*76 =2401 -1596=805\n\nWhich is the same as before, so the solution is as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the numbers? If, for example, k8 was 225 instead of 224, then:\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =225\n\nThen, following the same steps:\n\nFrom equation1:49a +21b=76\n\nMultiply equation1 by 49:49*(49a +21b)=49*76 \u21922401a +1029b=3724\n\nEquation2 multiplied by21:21*(76a +49b)=21*225 \u21921596a +1029b=4725\n\nSubtract equation1*49 - equation2*21:\n\n(2401a -1596a) + (1029b -1029b)=3724-4725\n\n805a = -1001 \u2192a= -1001/805\u2248-1.243, still not integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe different numbers. Alternatively, the problem might have a different setup?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking whether such a and b exist (even if non-integer), but the question says \"integer\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way the terms are numbered. For example, perhaps k7 is built from k6 and k5, but maybe the indices are shifted?\n\nWait, the user says \"For k7 =76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\". So they must be taking k6=49 and k5=21. Similarly for k8=224 =a\u00d776 +b\u00d749, so k7=76 and k6=49. So that's consistent. So the prior terms are k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224.\n\nSo the problem is correctly set up. Hence, since there is no integer solution, the answer is no. But maybe the question is part of a larger problem where fractional coefficients are allowed, but the user specifies integers. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made an error in the problem's numbers? But since I have to work with what's given, I think the answer is that there are no integer coefficients, so the recurrence with integer a and b does not exist.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check another way. Suppose there is a recurrence with real numbers a and b, then what is the ratio between a and b?\n\nFrom equation1:49a +21b=76 \u2192a=(76-21b)/49\n\nPlug into equation2:\n\n76*(76-21b)/49 +49b=224\n\nMultiply through by49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n76*(76-21b) +49\u00b2b =224*49\n\nCompute:\n\n76\u00b2 -76*21b +2401b=224*49\n\n76\u00b2=5776\n\n76*21=1596\n\nSo:\n\n5776 + ( -1596b +2401b ) =10976\n\nThus:\n\n5776 +805b =10976\n\n805b=5200\n\nSo b=5200/805= as before, and a=(76-21*(5200/805))/49.\n\nBut this is just confirming same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the recurrence could be of higher order? But the question specifically says \"recurrence\" without specifying the order, but the equations given are for a second-order recurrence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question allows a and b to be fractions, and wants the values? But since it says integer, probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in another base? Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a miscalculation in my steps. Let me recheck.\n\nGiven equations:\n\n1)49a +21b =76\n\n2)76a +49b =224\n\nLet me try solving for a from equation1:\n\na=(76-21b)/49\n\nPlug into equation2:\n\n76*(76-21b)/49 +49b =224\n\nMultiply all terms by49:\n\n76*(76-21b) +49\u00b2b =224*49\n\nYes:\n\n76\u00b2 -76*21b +2401b =224*49\n\nYes, and then:\n\n76\u00b2=5776, 224*49=10976, so 5776 + (2401-1596)b =10976\n\n2401-1596=805 \u21925776+805b=10976 \u2192805b=5200 \u2192b=5200/805.\n\nYes, 5200 divided by 805: let's see 805*6=4830, 5200-4830=370, 805*0.459\u2026\u2248370, so yes 6.459.\n\nSame as before. So no integer solution.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that there are no integer coefficients a and b satisfying the equations, so the answer is no. But the question is phrased as \"Can you find integer a, b?\" so the answer is no.\n\nHowever, the problem might have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the values of a and b even if they are fractions? Let me see:\n\na= (76*49 -21*224)/ (49\u00b2 -21*76 )\n\nWait, using Cramer's rule:\n\nDeterminant D=49*49-21*76=2401-1596=805\n\nD_a= |76 21;224 49|=76*49 -21*224= 3724 -4704= -980\n\nSo a=D_a/D= -980/805= -196/161= -28/23\u2248-1.217\n\nSimilarly D_b= |49 76;76 224|=49*224 -76*76= 10976 -5776=5200\n\nThus b=D_b/D=5200/805=1040/161\u22486.459\n\nSo fractional a and b exist, but not integers.\n\nTherefore, since the problem asks for integer a and b, the answer is that there are none. So boxed answer would be \"No solution\", but since the user might expect to write the values even if non-integer, but the question specifies integers. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a source where the numbers are different. Alternatively, perhaps I made an arithmetic mistake?\n\nWait, let me verify 21*76:\n\n21*70=1470, 21*6=126, so 1470+126=1596. Correct.\n\n49\u00b2=2401, yes.\n\n76\u00b2=5776, correct.\n\n224*49: 200*49=9800, 24*49=1176, total 9800+1176=10976. Correct.\n\nThus calculations are correct. So the conclusion holds.\n\nHence, the answer is that there are no integer solutions for a and b. So if the question expects to answer with \"No\", but in the format they want boxed answer, maybe they expect fractions?\n\nWait the original problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". Typically in math problems like this, even if there is no solution, maybe express as fractions?\n\nWait maybe the user just wants the values of a and b, boxed as fractions?\n\nThe problem didn't specify that a and b must be integers, but the user's question here says \"find integer a, b\".\n\nWait looking back:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"F: Please write in English.\n\nF: F:\n\n",
