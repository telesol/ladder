Let's analyze step by step.\n\nStep 1: Counting ones:\nk1: 1 (binary \"1\") has count of ones = 1\nk2: 3 (binary \"11\") count ones = 2.\nk3: 7 (\"111\") count ones = 3.\nk4: 8 (\"1000\") count ones = 1.\nk5: 21 (\"10101\"): count ones = ? Let's check: 21 in binary is: 16+4+1, so bits: 10101 (positions: bit5=1, bit3=0? Actually wait let me recalc:\n21 decimal = 16 + 4 + 1, which means bits: \n- 16 => binary digit 101... Let's explicitly compute: 21 in binary is \"10101\" because it equals 16 (2^4) plus 4 (2^2) plus 1 (2^0). So yes count ones = 3.\nk6: 49 (\"110001\"): check bits: 49=32+16+1? Wait recalc: 49 decimal = 32 + 16 + 1, which is binary \"110001\" with ones count = maybe: Actually let's see: 49 in binary: 32 (2^5) then 16 (2^4) then 0 for bit3, then 0 for bit2, then 0 for bit1, then 1 for bit0. So that is \"110001\". Count ones = 3.\nk7: 76 (\"1001100\"): Let's recalc: 76 in binary = 64 + 8 + 4, so count ones? digits: 76=64+8+4, which equals \"1001100\", count ones = how many ones? Bits at positions: bit6=1, bit3=1, bit2=1 => total of three ones.\nk8: 224 (\"11100000\"): Check bits: 224 in binary is likely: 128+64+32 then zeros. Count ones = 3.\nk9: 467 (\"111010011\"). Let's count: digits: maybe check sum: \"111010011\" has count ones: \nDigit by digit: '1' then '1', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '1','1'. Count ones: 1+1+1+? Actually let me count properly:\nBinary for k9 is given as \"111010011\" - which has digits: \nPositions from left to right: (8 bits?) But it's a 9-bit string. Count ones: '1' at first, second, third positions: that gives three ones so far; then digit 4 = '0'; then digit 5 = '1': now four; digit 6 = '0'; digit 7 = '0'; digit 8 = '1': five; digit 9 = '1': six. So count ones = 6.\nk10: 514 (\"1000000010\"). Count ones:\n\"1000000010\": bits positions: first bit is 1, then zeros until the second last bit? Let's check: it has length maybe 10 bits. It looks like \"1 000000010\" with count ones = 2.\nk11: 1155 (\"10010000011\"). Count ones:\n\"10010000011\": digits: '1' then '0' then '0' then '1', then zeros, etc. Let's count carefully:\ndigits: \n1) first digit: 1\n2) second: 0\n3) third: 0\n4) fourth: 1\n5) fifth: 0\n6) sixth: 0\n7) seventh: 0\n8) eighth: 0\n9) ninth: 1\n10) tenth: 1.\nSo count ones = positions: first digit (1), fourth digit (1), ninth digit (1), and tenth digit (1). So total of 4 ones.\nk12: 2683 (\"101001111011\"). Count ones:\nLet's write digits: \"1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\". Now count ones: \ndigit1=1, digit2=0, digit3=1, digit4=0, digit5=0, digit6=1, digit7=1, digit8=1, digit9=1, digit10=0, digit11=1, digit12=1.\nSo count ones = 1+? Let's do: digits with 1: positions 1,3,6,7,8,9,11,12 => that is 8 ones. So k12 has 8 ones.\nk13: 5765 (\"1011010000101\"). Count ones:\nWrite digits: \"1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\". Count ones positions: digit1=1, digit2=0, digit3=1, digit4=1, digit5=0, digit6=1, digit7=0, digit8=0, digit9=0, digit10=0, digit11=1, digit12=0, digit13=1. So count ones = digits at positions 1,3,4,6,11,13 => that's 6 ones.\nk14: 10544 (\"10100100110000\"). Count ones:\nWrite digits: \"1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\". So count ones = positions: digit1=1, digit3=1, digit6=1, digit9=1, digit10=1. That gives total of 5 ones.\n\nSo summary counts: \nk1: 1; k2: 2; k3: 3; k4: 1; k5: 3; k6: 3; k7: 3; k8: 3; k9: 6; k10: 2; k11: 4; k12: 8; k13: 6; k14: 5.\n\nNot sure if that pattern is directly obvious.\n\nStep 2: Leading bit position = floor(log2(k)) + 1.\nFor each k, compute number of bits required. For example:\nk1=1, log2(1)=0 so floor(log2(1))+1 = 0+1 = 1 (so binary has one digit)\nk2=3, log2(3) ~ 1.58, floor is 1 then +1 = 2 digits.\nk3=7, log2(7) ~2.8, floor=2, so 3 bits.\nk4=8, log2(8)=3 so floor+1=3+? Wait check: log2(8)=3 exactly, so number of bits is 4 (or actually wait, it says leading bit position = floor(log2(k)) + 1. For k4=8, floor(log2(8))=3 and plus 1 gives 4 which matches binary representation \"1000\" length 4).\nk5: 21 -> log2(21) is about 4.39, so floor=4 then +1 = 5 bits.\nk6: 49 -> log2(49) is ~5.61, so floor=5 then +1 = 6 bits.\nk7: 76 -> log2(76) is about 6.24, floor=6 then +1 = 7 bits.\nk8: 224 -> log2(224) ~7.81, floor=7 then +1=8 bits.\nk9: 467 -> log2(467) is about 8.87, so floor=8 then +1 = 9 bits.\nk10: 514 -> log2(514)=9.00? Actually check: log2(512)=9 exactly and 514 >512 so floor=9? Wait recalc: For k10 = 514, log2(514) is slightly more than 9 but floor remains 9 then +1 gives 10 bits.\nk11: 1155 -> log2(1155) approximates maybe 10.17 (because 1024 <1155<2048), so floor=10 then +1 = 11 bits.\nk12: 2683 -> floor(log2(2683)) is? log2(2683) ~11.06, so floor=11 then +1 = 12 bits.\nk13: 5765 -> log2(5765) about 12.51, so floor=12 then +1 = 13 bits.\nk14: 10544 -> log2(10544) is maybe 13.36, floor=13 then +1 = 14 bits.\n\nSo it matches the lengths of the given binary representation as expected.\n\nStep 3: XOR patterns? It says \"Any XOR patterns? k3 XOR k4 = 7 XOR 8 = 15\". Let's check that: 7 in binary is 0111 (if aligning to same bit-length) and 8 is 1000. Their XOR yields 1111 which equals decimal 15. That might be something like \"the XOR of two numbers may yield a number with all bits set, if one number is the complement of some pattern relative to each other\"? Possibly we can check others.\n\nMaybe analyze consecutive keys for patterns in bit positions? For instance, k2 and k3: \nk2 = 11 (binary) vs k3=111, so XOR maybe gives something interesting. Let's try: 11 XOR 111; align them as 011 XOR 111 yields 100 which equals decimal 4.\nMaybe pattern with k4 and k5? k4 = 1000 vs k5 = 10101 (if we pad to equal length, but not sure).\nLet's check k7 and k8? k7=1001100, k8=11100000; XOR them maybe might yield a pattern. But the question specifically mentions \"k3 XOR k4 = 15\", which is interesting because 15 in binary is all ones with same number of bits as k4. \n\nMaybe there's pattern: For instance, if we consider keys that are consecutive odd numbers (like k2=3 and k3=7) they are both ones repeated? Actually note k1, k2, k3 form the sequence 1, 3, 7, which is like 2^n - 1 for n = 1,2,3. Then k4=8, which is a power of 2. So maybe pattern: some keys are \"all ones\" (k1, k2, k3) and then a pure power-of-2 value (k4). Next k5=21 seems like sum of two powers? Let's try to see if there's recurrence? Possibly each new key might be derived by adding the previous key plus something like its binary digit count or XOR with previous?\n\nWe can also check differences: \nDifference between keys:\nk1 = 1, then k2 - k1=2, then k3-k2=4, then k4 - k3=1, then k5-k4=13, then k6-k5=28, then k7-k6=27, then k8-k7=148, then k9-k8=243, then k10-k9=47, then k11 - k10 = 641, then k12 - k11=1528, then k13 - k12=1982, then k14 - k13= 10544 -5765 = 4779.\nNot an obvious arithmetic progression.\n\nMaybe a relationship with bit counts and maybe some transformation like rotate bits? The question asks \"Are there bit-rotation relationships?\" So check if any keys are rotations of each other. For instance, compare k2=11 (binary) and then k3=111 is not rotation? Wait, 11 rotated left or right might become 101 or something. But I need to see potential pattern: maybe the sequence is constructed from bit-rotations? For example, notice that k1 = 1, k2=11, k3=111 are like repeating '1's. Then k4=8 is a power-of-two with one '1' at beginning and trailing zeros.\nMaybe the idea is to look at these keys in terms of their binary pattern structure: Some numbers have all bits ones (like k1, k2, k3) while others have isolated bits set. \nWe can check potential rotation relationship:\nFor instance, if we rotate k2=11 (which is 11, or \"011\" padded with zero maybe?) Not sure.\n\nMaybe there's pattern: k3 and k4 are complementary in a sense because XOR gives all ones. So one might guess that k15 could be the complement of some previous key? But then question: \"Find binary patterns that could help predict k15.\" Possibly answer is \"k15 seems to follow the same bit-length progression as others, i.e., its number of bits is floor(log2(k14)) + 1. So for k15, we expect a binary representation with 14 or maybe 15 bits if it's greater than 8191. Let's check: k14=10544. The next power-of-two after that is 16384 (14 bits) but k15 might be less than 16384? Not sure.\n\nMaybe look at pattern of ones count: \nk1: 1, k2: 2, k3: 3, then k4: 1 again, then k5: 3, k6: 3, k7: 3, k8: 3, k9: 6, k10: 2, k11: 4, k12: 8, k13: 6, k14: 5. \nThe ones count sequence doesn't show an obvious arithmetic progression.\n\nMaybe look at the fact that many keys are almost \"mirror\" numbers in binary? Possibly we can examine bit structure:\nk1=1 (just a single 1)\nk2=11\nk3=111 - these are sequences of ones.\nThen k4 = 1000, which is like a one followed by zeros. Then k5 = 10101, which has ones in positions 0,2,4 maybe? That pattern is symmetric (palindrome: 1-0-1-0-1). \nk6=110001 - check if palindrome: reverse of 110001 becomes 100011 which is different from 110001. Not sure.\nk7=1001100; reverse is 0011001, not equal.\nMaybe pattern in zeros? k5: 10101, has alternating bits.\nk10: 514 = 1000000010, seems like a '1' then many zeros then \"010\", which could be symmetric in some way.\nWe might try to see if there is a recurrence relationship that yields these numbers from previous ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is generated by applying some binary transformation rule repeatedly. Possibly each k is obtained by toggling bits or adding/subtracting powers of 2 in specific positions relative to previous terms.\n\nCheck pattern: \nk1 = 1\nThen maybe k2 is obtained by taking k1 and appending a \"1\" bit? That would yield 11.\nThen k3 might be obtained by prepending a \"1\" to k2, yielding 111. Then k4 might be obtained from k3 by shifting right or left? k3 = 111 (in binary) if we append a zero at the end, it becomes 1110 which is not equal to 8. But 8 in binary is 1000. So maybe k4 is derived from k3 by reversing bits order: 111 reversed is 111 which equals 7, not 8. \nMaybe k4 is computed as something like: for k2 and k3, they are of the form (2^n -1) where n=1,2,3; then k4 is a power-of-2, 2^3 = 8. Then perhaps k5 might be formed by adding 13 to get 21? And k6 is obtained by something like doubling and subtracting one maybe.\n\nPerhaps we consider the possibility that these keys are indices in some combinatorial arrangement such as Gray codes or De Bruijn sequences. They mention \"bit-rotation\", which suggests a cyclic shift of bits might be involved. For example, if you take k3 = 111 (or 0111) and rotate it, you get 1110 which is 14 in decimal? Not matching any.\nMaybe check: k2=11 rotated left by one becomes 11 appended with the first bit gives 11 -> if we treat as a circular arrangement, then rotating \"11\" doesn't change it. But for longer sequences like k5 = 10101, if you rotate that maybe you get a pattern that is also in the sequence: For instance, k10=1000000010 rotated might yield something similar? Not sure.\n\nWe could try to see if any of these numbers appear as rotations of one another:\nMaybe compare k4 and k5. k4 = 8 (binary 1000). If we rotate it circularly by one position: possible rotations of \"1000\" are \"0001\", \"0010\", \"0100\". Those correspond to decimal 1,2,4 respectively. And indeed, k1=1, k2=3? Actually 4 is not in the list exactly; though 4 appears as a difference sometimes.\n\nMaybe there's a relationship: k5 = 10101 (which is symmetric) and k6=110001 are almost mirror images? If I reverse k6 \"110001\", I get \"100011\" which equals decimal 35, but that is not in the list either.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider differences between successive ones:\nd1: 3-1 =2\nd2: 7-3=4\nd3: 8-7=1\nd4: 21-8=13\nd5: 49-21=28\nd6: 76-49=27\nd7: 224-76=148\nd8: 467-224=243\nd9: 514-467=47\nd10:1155-514=641\nd11:2683-1155=1528\nd12:5765-2683=1982\nd13:10544-5765=4779\n\nMaybe differences themselves have a pattern? \n2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,47,641,1528,1982,4779.\nNot obvious.\n\nMaybe consider binary XORs of successive ones:\nk1 XOR k2 = 1 XOR 3 = 2 (10)\nk2 XOR k3 = 3 XOR 7 = 4 (100)\nk3 XOR k4 = 7 XOR 8 = 15 (1111)\nk4 XOR k5 = 8 XOR 21. Let's compute: 8 in binary is 1000, 21 is 10101 (which as 5 bits, pad 8 to 01000) so XOR=10101 ^ 01000 = 11101 which is 29 decimal.\nk5 XOR k6 = 21 XOR 49. Write them in binary with same length: k5=10101 (5-bit), k6=110001 (6-bit). Pad k5 to 6 bits: 010101, then XOR 110001 gives 100100 which is 36 decimal.\nk6 XOR k7 = 49 XOR 76. In binary: 49=110001, 76=1001100 (7-bit), pad 49 to 7 bits: 0110001, XOR with 1001100 gives 1111101 = 125 decimal.\nNot sure if there's pattern.\n\nMaybe consider sums of bits positions? \nk3 and k4 have relationship that their XOR yields all ones. Is it a coincidence?\nk3=111 (in binary) is (2^3 - 1). k4=8 which is exactly one greater than 7, so they are consecutive integers in the sense of one being \"all ones\" and then the next power-of-two. Similarly, earlier we had k2=11 (which is 3) and if we consider the predecessor of a power-of-2: The number immediately before 8 is 7, which was k3. So maybe there's a pattern: k1, k2, k3 are one less than powers-of-two? But no, 1 is 1, 3 is 3, 7 is 7.\nWait, check: k4=8 is power-of-2; its predecessor (if we subtract 1) would be 7 which is k3. Then maybe the next number after a power-of-2 should be one less than that? But then k5=21, and 21+1 =22 not a power-of-2.\nMaybe there's an alternating pattern: odd-index keys are \"all ones\" or nearly so, even-index keys are power-of-two plus something. For instance:\nk1 (odd) is 1 (which is 2^0), k2 (even) is 3 (not a power-of-two but almost; difference from next power-of-2: 4 - 3 =1?), k3 (odd) is 7 (which is one less than 8, a power-of-two), k4 (even) is 8 (a power-of-two). Then k5 (odd) is 21, which is not of the form 2^n -1 but close to 16+5? Not sure.\nAlternatively maybe odd-index keys are \"complement\" to even ones.\n\nMaybe we can also consider bit counts: \nk3 has all bits set. k4 has a single 1 at one end and zeros in between; then k5 returns to having alternating pattern (10101). Perhaps there is a transformation that rotates the positions of bits from one term to the next. For example, compare k2=11 and k3=111: If you rotate k2 to the left by adding a 1 at the beginning, you get 111.\nThen maybe k4 is obtained by taking k3 (111) and moving the most significant bit to the end? That would yield 110, which in binary is 6, but k4=8. \nMaybe not.\n\nAlternatively, check structure: k5=10101 seems palindromic. k10 = 1000000010 also has a form: \"1\" followed by five zeros then \"010\"? Actually it's \"1000000010\". Is that symmetric? Reverse of that is \"0100000001\", which is not the same, but if you remove leading zero it might be considered palindromic in some sense.\n\nMaybe we can see if keys are mirror images with respect to a center bit. For example, k5=10101: middle digit is 1, symmetric around that.\nk10=1000000010: length 10 bits, the pattern might be 1, then six zeros? Actually let's count: \"1 00000 0010\" which is not obviously palindromic.\nMaybe check k12=2683 in binary: as given, it's \"101010101011\"? Wait, they provided k12 = 2683 and its binary representation was given as ... actually wait the question provides explicit binary representations for each key. Let\u2019s re-read the question:\n\nIt says:\n\"k1= 1 (binary: 1)\nk2= 3 (binary: 11)\nk3= 7 (binary: 111)\nk4= 8 (binary: 1000)\nk5= 21 (binary: 10101)\nk6= 49 (binary: 110001)\nk7= 76 (binary: 1001100)\nk8= 224 (binary: 11100000)\nk9= 467 (binary: ??? but given as \"???) Actually provided text:\n\"k1= 1 \nk2= 3 \nk3= 7 \nk4= 8 \nk5= 21 \nk6= 49 \nk7= 76 \nk8= 224 \nk9= 467 \nk10=514 \nk11=1155 \nk12=2683 \nk13=5765 \nk14=10544\"\nand then in parentheses, they show binary representations:\n\"1,\n11,\n111,\n1000,\n10101,\n110001,\n1001100,\n11100000,\n467 (binary representation not given?), 514,\n1155,\n2683,\n5765,\n10544\"\n\nWait the question says \"see below\" and then lists keys with their values. It might be that each key has a binary representation, but for some it's omitted in the text here.\n\nMaybe there is a pattern: k1=1, k2=3, k3=7 are of the form (2^n - 1). Then k4=8 which is exactly one more than 7. Then k5=21, then k6=49. Notice that 21 and 49, these numbers appear in sequences sometimes: 49 is 7*7, and 21 is 7*3? Not sure.\nThen k7=76. Then k8=224. 224 is 32*7? Actually 224/7 = 32, yes; 76/7 = ~10.857, not sure.\n\nMaybe differences: 3-1=2, 7-3=4, 8-7=1, 21-8=13, 49-21=28, 76-49=27, 224-76=148, next difference? \nThen k9=467, so difference is 467-224 =243. Then k10=514, diff=47. k11=1155,diff=641; k12=2683,diff=1528; k13=5765,diff=1982; k14=10544,diff=4779.\nMaybe the differences themselves follow a pattern? \n2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,47,641,1528,1982,4779. Not obviously.\n\nWait maybe consider ratios: 3/1=3,7/3\u22482.33,8/7\u22481.14,21/8=2.625,49/21\u22482.333,76/49\u22481.551,224/76\u22482.947,467/224\u22482.085,514/467\u22481.101,1155/514\u22482.247,2683/1155\u22482.323,5765/2683\u22482.148,10544/5765\u22481.83.\nNot clear.\n\nMaybe consider binary representations:\nk1 = 1 = \"1\"\nk2 = 3 = \"11\" (two ones)\nk3 = 7 = \"111\" (three ones)\nSo pattern: k1 has one '1', k2 two '1's, k3 three '1's.\nThen k4 = 8 in binary is \"1000\", which has one '1'. So maybe the count of ones goes 1, then 2, then 3, then back to 1? \nk5 = 21 in binary: given as \"10101\" which has three ones. \nk6 = 49 in binary: \"110001\" which has three ones? Actually count: 1+1+0+0+0+1=3.\nk7 = 76 in binary: \"1001100\": count ones: 1+0+0+1+1+0+0 = 3.\nk8 = 224 in binary: \"11100000\": count ones: 3.\nThen k9 = 467, what is its binary? Let's compute: 467 decimal in binary: 256 + 128=384, remainder 83; then 64 fits into 83 (yes), so 384+64=448, remainder 19; then 16 fits into 19 (yes) gives 464, remainder 3; then 2 and 1. So binary: 111010011? Let's do carefully:\n467/256 =1 remainder 211.\n211/128 =1 remainder 83.\n83/64=1 remainder 19.\n19/32=0,\n19/16=1 remainder 3,\n3/8=0,\n3/4=0,\n3/2=1 remainder 1,\n1/1=1. So binary: 1 (256) then 1(128), 1(64), 0(32), 0(16?), wait recalc:\nActually, 467 = 256 + 128 =384, plus 64 =448, plus 16 =464, plus 2 =466, plus 1=467.\nSo bits for: 256 (bit8), 128 (bit7), 64 (bit6), 32 (bit5): 0 because 467-448=19 <32, bit4: 16 fits so 1, remainder 3; bit3: 8 doesn't fit, so 0; bit2: 4 doesn't fit into 3 so 0; bit1: 2 fits so 1; bit0: 1 fits so 1.\nSo binary = 111010011? Let's write positions:\nBit8:1, bit7:1, bit6:1, bit5:0, bit4:1, bit3:0, bit2:0, bit1:1, bit0:1. That gives count ones= 1+1+1+0+1+0+0+1+1 =6.\nk10 =514 in binary should be 514 =512 +2, so \"1000000010\", which has two ones.\nk11=1155, what's that? 1155=1024+128- - actually 1155 in binary: 1155/512=2 remainder 131, then 256 doesn't fit because 131<256; then 128 fits once remainder 3; then 64 no, 32 no, 16 no, 8 no, 4 no, 2 fits once remainder1, then 1 fits once. So binary: 10010000111, count ones=?\nk12=2683 in binary: maybe similar pattern.\nMaybe the pattern is about the number of ones. k1 has one '1'; k2 has two; k3 has three; k4 (8) has one; k5 (21) has three; k6 (49) has three? Actually let\u2019s recount:\nk1: \"1\" -> count=1.\nk2: \"11\" -> count=2.\nk3: \"111\" -> count=3.\nk4: \"1000\" -> count=1.\nk5: \"10101\" -> count ones: positions 4,2,0 so count=3? Actually \"10101\": digits: 1,0,1,0,1 => three ones.\nk6: \"110001\": digits: 1,1,0,0,0,1 => count=3.\nk7: \"1001100\": count: 1,0,0,1,1,0,0 = 3.\nk8: \"11100000\": count: 1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0 = 3.\nk9: we computed maybe count=6? Let's recompute k9=467: bits: 256+128+64+16+2+1. That is 6 ones.\nk10: \"1000000010\": count ones: two ones.\nk11=1155, let's compute binary properly: 1155/512 =2 remainder 131; 256 >131 so bit8=0? Wait, careful:\n1155 in binary: The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 1155 is 1024 (2^10). So write as 11 bits.\nBit10 (1024): 1, remaining 1155-1024 =131.\nBit9 (512): 0 because 131 <512,\nBit8 (256): 0 because 131<256,\nBit7 (128): 1, remaining 131-128=3,\nBit6 (64): 0,\nBit5 (32): 0,\nBit4 (16): 0? Actually check: 3 is less than 16 so bit4=0.\nBit3 (8): 0,\nBit2 (4): 0,\nBit1 (2): 1, remaining 1,\nBit0 (1): 1.\nSo binary for k11=1155 is \"10000000111\". Count ones: digits: '1', then five zeros, then three ones? Actually count: there's a leading 1 at bit10, then bits9-4 are 00000, then bits3-0: 0111 which has three ones. So total ones=1+3 =4.\nk12=2683 in binary: The largest power is 2048 (2^11). Write as maybe 12 bits:\nBit11: 2048? 2683-2048=635, so bit11=1.\nThen next power: 1024 fits into 635 once, remainder 611,\nNext:512 fits into 611 once, remainder 99,\n256 doesn't fit in 99, so 0,\n128 doesn't fit, so 0,\n64 fits into 99 once, remainder 35,\n32 fits into 35 once, remainder 3,\n16 doesn't fit (3 <16), so 0,\n8 doesn't fit, so 0,\n4 doesn't fit because 3<4? Actually 4 does not fit in 3 so 0,\n2 fits into 3 once, remainder 1,\n1 fits into 1 once.\nSo binary: 1 (2048) , 1(1024), 1(512), 0(256), 0(128), 1(64), 1(32), 0(16), 0(8), 0(4), 1(2), 1(1). Count ones: that's 1+1+1+0+0+1+1+0+0+0+1+1 = 7.\nk13=5765 in binary:\nLargest power: 4096 (2^12) fits, remainder 1669,\nNext: 2048 fits into 1669? No, because 2048 >1669 so bit11=0,\nNext:1024 fits into 1669 once, remainder 645,\nNext:512 fits into 645 once, remainder 133,\nNext:256 doesn't fit (133<256) so 0,\n128 fits into 133 once, remainder 5,\n64 doesn't fit, so 0,\n32 doesn't fit, so 0,\n16 doesn't fit because 5<16, so 0,\n8 doesn't fit, so 0,\n4 fits into 5 once, remainder 1,\n2 fits into 1? No, so 0,\n1 fits.\nSo binary: bits: bit12:1 (4096), bit11:0, bit10:1 (1024), bit9:1 (512), bit8:0, bit7:0, bit6:128? Let's recalc carefully:\n5765 - 4096 =1669.\nBit11 (2048): 0 since 1669<2048.\nBit10 (1024): yes, remainder 645.\nBit9 (512): yes, remainder 133.\nBit8 (256): no, because 133 <256, so bit8=0.\nBit7 (128): yes, remainder 5.\nBit6 (64): no, 5<64 so 0.\nBit5 (32): no,\nBit4 (16): no,\nBit3 (8): no,\nBit2 (4): yes, remainder 1.\nBit1 (2): no,\nBit0 (1): yes.\nSo binary = 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1? Let's count bits from bit12 to bit0:\nbit12:1,\nbit11:0,\nbit10:1,\nbit9:1,\nbit8:0,\nbit7:1,\nbit6:0,\nbit5:0,\nbit4:0,\nbit3:0,\nbit2:1? Wait, we got remainder 5 after subtracting 128 from 133, so bit7=1 then next is bit? Let's recompute:\n5765 =4096 + ? Actually, let me compute in descending order:\nStart with 4096 (bit12) -> used.\nRemaining: 5765 -4096 =1669.\nNext highest power is 2048 (bit11): 1669 < 2048 so bit11=0.\nNext, 1024 (bit10): yes, remainder 1669-1024=645. So bit10=1.\nNext,512 (bit9): 645>=512, yes, remainder 645-512=133. So bit9=1.\nNext,256 (bit8): 133 <256 so bit8=0.\nNext,128 (bit7): 133>=128, yes, remainder 133-128 =5. So bit7=1.\nNext,64 (bit6): 5<64 so bit6=0.\nNext,32 (bit5): 5<32 so bit5=0.\nNext,16 (bit4): 5<16 so bit4=0.\nNext,8 (bit3): 5<8 so bit3=0.\nNext,4 (bit2): yes because 5>=4, remainder 5-4=1. So bit2=1.\nNext,2 (bit1): 1<2 so bit1=0.\nNext,1 (bit0): yes, remainder 0. So bit0=1.\n\nSo binary for k13 = bits from bit12 to bit0: 1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0? Let's list in order:\nBit12:1\nBit11:0\nBit10:1\nBit9:1\nBit8:0\nBit7:1\nBit6:0\nBit5:0\nBit4:0\nBit3:0\nBit2:1\nBit1:0\nBit0:1\n\nThat gives \"101100001001\" but count ones: 1 (bit12) +0+1+1+0+0+0+0+? Let's count properly:\nPositions with 1: bit12, bit10, bit9, bit7, bit2, bit0. That is 6 ones.\nk14=10544 in binary:\nLargest power: 8192 (bit13) because 10544>8192 so bit13=1, remainder =10544-8192=2352.\nNext:4096 (bit12): 2352<4096 so bit12=0.\nNext:2048 (bit11): yes, 2352>=2048, remainder =2352-2048=304. So bit11=1.\nNext:1024 (bit10): 304<1024 so bit10=0.\nNext:512 (bit9): 304<512 so bit9=0.\nNext:256 (bit8): yes, 304>=256, remainder =304-256=48. So bit8=1.\nNext:128 (bit7): 48<128 so bit7=0.\nNext:64 (bit6): 48<64 so bit6=0.\nNext:32 (bit5): yes, 48>=32, remainder =48-32=16. So bit5=1.\nNext:16 (bit4): yes, remainder =16-16=0, so bit4=1.\nThen bits below are 0.\nSo binary for k14 from bit13 to bit0 is: \nBit13:1,\nBit12:0,\nBit11:1,\nBit10:0,\nBit9:0,\nBit8:1,\nBit7:0,\nBit6:0,\nBit5:1,\nBit4:1,\nand then zeros.\nCount ones = 1+? Let's count: bit13=1, bit11=1, bit8=1, bit5=1, bit4=1. So total ones = 5.\n\nSo the counts of ones in binary representations seem to follow a pattern maybe:\nk1: \"1\" -> count 1\nk2: \"11\" -> count 2\nk3: \"111\" -> count 3\nk4: \"1000\" -> count 1\nk5: \"10101\" -> count? Let's re-check k5 =21. 21 in binary is indeed 10101 (16+4+1) so count ones=3.\nk6: \"110001\" for 49: count ones = ? 49 in binary: 32 + 16 + 1, so that's three ones.\nk7: 76: we computed maybe count ones? 76 in binary: 64 + 8 +4 =76, so count ones=3.\nk8: 224: binary \"11100000\": count ones=3.\nk9: 467: count ones= ? (256+128+64+16+2+1) =6 ones.\nk10: 514: \"1000000010\" -> two ones.\nk11: 1155: \"10000000111\" -> count ones = 4.\nk12: 2683: count ones = 7.\nk13: 5765: count ones = 6.\nk14: 10544: count ones = 5.\n\nI see no obvious pattern in number of ones though.\n\nMaybe there is another pattern. Let's list keys and try to find differences between successive terms:\n1, 3, 7, 8, 21, 49, 76, 224, 467, 514, 1155, 2683, 5765, 10544.\nDifferences:\n3-1 =2\n7-3=4\n8-7=1\n21-8=13\n49-21=28\n76-49=27\n224-76=148\n467-224=243\n514-467=47\n1155-514=641\n2683-1155=1528\n5765-2683=3082? Actually 5765-2683 =3082, wait recalc: 5765 - 2683 =3082, but earlier I computed 1982 maybe for k13-k12?\nLet's re-check differences:\nk1=1\nk2=3 => diff=2\nk3=7 => diff=4\nk4=8 => diff=1\nk5=21 => diff=13\nk6=49 => diff=28\nk7=76 => diff=27\nk8=224 => diff=148\nk9=467 => diff=243\nk10=514 => diff=47\nk11=1155 => diff=641\nk12=2683 => diff=1528\nk13=5765 => diff = 5765 -2683 =3082? Let's recalc: 2683 + 2000 would be 4683, plus 1000 =5683, plus 82 =57765? I'm mixing up digits. Let's do k12 to k13 properly:\nk12 = 2683\nk13 = 5765\nDifference = 5765 - 2683 = 3082.\nThen k14=10544, difference = 10544-5765 = 4779.\nNow check differences of differences maybe?\n2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,47,641,1528,3082,4779.\n\nNot obvious pattern.\n\nMaybe the sequence is from a known puzzle: \"Find the pattern\" etc. It might be generated by reading digits in a mirror or something.\n\nI see numbers that are one less than powers of 2 sometimes:\n1 = (2^1 - 1) maybe?\n3 = (2^2 - 1)\n7 = (2^3 - 1)\nBut then 8 is not (2^n -1). 21, 49... these are not Mersenne numbers.\n\nMaybe it's something like: odd terms are one less than powers of 2 and even terms are something else? \nTerm1=1 (2^1-1), term2=3 (2^2-1), term3=7 (2^3-1). Then term4=8 which is 2^3, then term5=21 maybe equals 2^4+5? No.\n\nAlternatively, could it be that the sequence represents the number of strokes to write numbers in English? Unclear.\n\nMaybe the pattern relates to binary representation lengths:\n1 in binary: \"1\" (length 1)\n3 in binary: \"11\" (length 2)\n7 in binary: \"111\" (length 3)\n8 in binary: \"1000\" (length 4) but not all ones.\n21 in binary: \"10101\" (alternating 1 and 0, length 5 maybe)\n49 in binary: \"110001\" (length 6? Actually 49 in binary is 110001 which has length 6)\n76 in binary: \"1001100\" would be length 7? Let's check: 76 in binary = 64+8+4=76, so that's \"1001100\". It has length 7. And 224 in binary = \"11100000\", length 8.\n467 in binary = \"111010011\"? Not sure.\n514 in binary = \"1000000010\" length 10? Actually 514 is 512+2 so \"1000000010\".\n1155 in binary = ? 1024+131=1155, so binary likely length 11 maybe.\n2683 in binary: around 2048 + 635 = 2683, length 12?\n5765 in binary: around 4096+1669 = 5765, length 13?\n10544 in binary: is it 8192+2352=10544, length 14?\n\nMaybe the index of the term corresponds to the number of digits in binary representation? Let's check:\nTerm1 (index 1): 1, which in binary \"1\" has 1 digit.\nTerm2 (index 2): 3, binary \"11\", 2 digits.\nTerm3 (index 3): 7, binary \"111\", 3 digits.\nTerm4 (index 4): 8, but 8 in binary is \"1000\", which has 4 digits. So far so good.\nTerm5 (index 5): should have binary representation of length 5, i.e., between 16 and 31 inclusive. And indeed 21 is between 16 and 31.\nTerm6 (index 6): should be between 32 and 63; 49 qualifies.\nTerm7 (index 7): should be between 64 and 127; 76 qualifies.\nTerm8 (index 8): should be between 128 and 255; 224 qualifies.\nTerm9 (index 9): should be between 256 and 511; 467 qualifies.\nTerm10 (index 10): should be between 512 and 1023; 514 qualifies.\nTerm11 (index 11): between 1024 and 2047; 1155 qualifies.\nTerm12 (index 12): between 2048 and 4095; 2683 qualifies.\nTerm13 (index 13): between 4096 and 8191; 5765 qualifies.\nTerm14 (index 14): between 8192 and 16383; 10544 qualifies.\n\nSo pattern: The nth term is a number whose binary representation has exactly n digits. And it seems to be chosen arbitrarily from that range? But then what is the rule for choosing which number in that range?\n\nMaybe they are picking the smallest or largest numbers with that many binary digits? Let's check:\nFor n=1, numbers with 1 digit: only possibility is 1.\nn=2: Numbers with 2-digit binary: from 2 to 3. But term2 is 3, which is the maximum in that range (since 3 in decimal = 11 in binary).\nn=3: 2-digit? Wait, for n=3, numbers with 3-digit binary are from 4 to 7. The maximum is 7, and indeed term3 is 7.\nn=4: Numbers with 4-digit binary: from 8 to 15. But term4 is 8, which is the minimum in that range.\nSo it alternates: For n=1 (min?), n=2 (max), n=3 (max) but then n=4 (min)? Let's check further:\nn=5: numbers with 5-digit binary: from 16 to 31. Term5 is 21, which is not the min or max; it's kind of in the middle? Actually 16 is min and 31 is max.\nn=6: range is 32 to 63, term6 =49, that's again a middle number (maybe average of 32 and 63 is ~47.5? Not exactly)\nn=7: range 64 to 127, term7=76, which is close to the lower half maybe?\nn=8: range 128-255, term8=224, which is near the high end.\nn=9: range 256-511, term9=467, again high end-ish (since max is 511).\nn=10: range 512-1023, term10=514, very low end? Actually 514 is just above 512.\nn=11: range 1024-2047, term11=1155, which is near the lower quarter maybe?\nn=12: range 2048-4095, term12=2683, which is around 2683, a bit above half (average ~3071.5)? Not sure.\nn=13: range 4096-8191, term13=5765, which is below the midpoint (~6143.5) maybe?\nn=14: range 8192-16383, term14=10544, which is just above the minimum.\n\nMaybe there's another pattern: Could it be that the sequence numbers are those with binary representations that have a certain property? For example, they might be \"prime\" in some base? Let\u2019s check primality:\n1 (not prime),\n3 (prime),\n7 (prime),\n8 (composite),\n21 (composite, 3*7),\n49 (composite, 7^2),\n76 (composite, 2*38 or 4*19),\n224 (composite, 7*32, etc.),\n467: is 467 prime? I think 467 is a prime number.\n514 = 2 *257, and 257 is prime, so 514 is semiprime.\n1155 factors as 3*385 = 3*5*7*11 maybe?\n2683: not sure if prime; 2683 mod small primes? 2683/7=383.285... maybe composite.\n5765: divisible by 5 maybe? 5765/5=1153, so composite.\n10544: even.\n\nNot all are prime.\n\nMaybe the sequence numbers when written in binary have a symmetrical pattern or count of \"1\"s that might follow a rule related to index:\nFor n-digit binary numbers, the maximum number is (2^n - 1) and minimum is 2^(n-1). Notice:\nTerm1: max? Actually for n=1, only option is 1.\nTerm2: 3 which equals 2^2-1.\nTerm3: 7 equals 2^3-1.\nTerm4: 8 equals 2^3 (the minimum of range for 4-digit binary numbers).\nThen term5: 21; the difference from maximum maybe? For n=5, maximum is 31, and 31 - 21 = 10. For n=6, maximum is 63, and 63-49 =14.\nTerm7: in range [64,127], term7=76, difference from minimum 76-64=12.\nMaybe differences: \nFor n=2: max-min=1? Actually for n=2, min=2, max=3, so 3 is chosen.\nn=3: range [4,7] and chosen 7 (max).\nn=4: range [8,15] and chosen 8 (min).\nn=5: range [16,31], chosen 21. That is not min or max. \nMaybe it's like this: odd-indexed terms are near the boundaries? Let's check indices:\nn=1 (odd) gives maximum in its trivial range.\nn=2 (even) gives maximum as well. n=3 (odd) gives maximum, n=4 (even) gives minimum. n=5 (odd) is 21 which is not max (31) nor min (16). \nMaybe the pattern: term = floor((min+max)/2) for even indices and something else for odd indices? Let's test:\nFor n=2: average of 2 and 3 is 2.5, round up to 3. That fits.\nn=3: average of 4 and 7 is 5.5, not 7 though.\nMaybe term = (min + something)? \nAlternatively, maybe it's like this: The nth term's binary representation has n digits, but the number of 1's in that binary representation equals the index of the term if possible? Let's count 1s:\nTerm1: \"1\" has one '1'. That matches index 1.\nTerm2: \"11\" has two 1's. Index 2.\nTerm3: \"111\" has three 1's. Index 3.\nTerm4: \"1000\" has one '1', but index is 4, so not matching.\nMaybe the number of letters when spelled out equals something? \nSpell them:\n1 -> \"one\" (3 letters)\n3 -> \"three\" (5 letters)\n7 -> \"seven\" (5 letters)\n8 -> \"eight\" (5 letters)\n21 -> \"twenty-one\" or \"21\" doesn't match.\nMaybe it's something with prime factors.\n\nLet me check differences between consecutive terms:\n3-1=2,\n7-3=4,\n8-7=1,\n49-8=41,\n76-49=27,\n224-76=148,\n467-224=243,\n514-467=47,\n1155-514=641,\n2683-1155=1528,\n5765-2683=3082,\n10544-5765=4779.\nMaybe these differences themselves have a pattern:\n2,4,1,41,27,148,243,47,641,1528,3082,4779.\nNot obvious.\n\nMaybe the sequence is: 1, 3, 7, 8, 21, 49, 76, 224, 467, 514, 1155, 2683, 5765, 10544,... \nI notice that some numbers are exactly one more than a power of 2? \nFor n=4: 8 = 8, which is 2^3. For n=10: 514 = 512 + 2, so not exactly.\nMaybe it's like this: term(n) = 2^(n-1) + something that alternates between 0 and some fixed offset?\nFor n=2: 2^(1)=2, plus 1 gives 3.\nn=3: 2^(2)=4, plus 3 gives 7.\nn=4: 2^(3)=8, plus 0 gives 8.\nn=5: 2^(4)=16, plus 5 gives 21.\nn=6: 2^(5)=32, plus 17 gives 49.\nn=7: 2^(6)=64, plus 12 gives 76.\nn=8: 2^(7)=128, plus 96 gives 224.\nn=9: 2^(8)=256, plus 211 gives 467? Wait 256+211 =467, but 211 is not a simple number.\nMaybe term(n) = 2^(n-1) + f(n) where f(n) might be the (n-1)th Fibonacci number or something?\nFibonacci: 1,1,2,3,5,8,... For n=2, f(2)=1 works. n=3, f(3)=2 but we need 3. Not matching.\n\nMaybe it's term(n) = (n-th prime) concatenated with something? \nPrimes: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,... doesn't match.\n\nWait maybe the pattern is simply: \"Write down numbers whose binary representation has exactly n digits.\" That seems to be a natural partition of nonnegative integers by the number of bits. And then possibly list them in increasing order? But if we list all numbers with 1 digit (which is just 1), then all numbers with 2 digits, etc., that sequence would start: 1; then 2,3; then 4,5,... but our sequence doesn't match that because it goes: 1,3,7,8,21,49,...\n\nWhat if we list the maximum of each range? That would be:\nFor n=1: max is 1.\nn=2: max is 3.\nn=3: max is 7.\nn=4: max is 15.\nn=5: max is 31.\nThat doesn't match because term4 should be 15, but it's given as 8.\n\nMaybe list the minimum of each range: \nFor n=1: min = 1.\nn=2: min = 2.\nn=3: min = 4.\nn=4: min = 8.\nn=5: min = 16.\nThat would be 1,2,4,8,16,... which is powers of 2. But our sequence is different.\n\nMaybe it's the difference between maximum and minimum? That doesn't match either.\n\nI recall a similar puzzle \"Find the pattern\" that goes like: \na(1)=1,\na(n)= a(n-1) + f(n)\nwhere f(n) are numbers with n digits in binary that have some property. But I'm not aware of any standard sequence matching these numbers.\nLet me check differences again carefully:\nTerm1=1, term2=3 (+2), term3=7 (+4), term4=8 (+1), term5=21 (+13), term6=49 (+28), term7=76 (+27), term8=224 (+148), term9=467 (+243), term10=514 (+47), term11=1155 (+641), term12=2683 (+1528), term13=5765 (+3082), term14=10544 (+4779).\n\nMaybe these increments themselves have binary representations that are suggestive? \n2 in binary: 10,\n4: 100,\n1: 1,\n13: 1101,\n28: 11100,\n27: 11011,\n148: 10010100,\n243: 11110011,\n47: 101111,\n641: 1010000001 (but that's 10 bits, not sure),\n1528: 11000101000 maybe,\n3082: ? and so on.\n\nMaybe they are sums of two consecutive primes? \n3-1=2, which is prime.\n7-3=4, which is not prime.\n8-7=1,\n49-8=41 (prime), \n76-49=27,\n224-76=148,\n467-224=243,\n514-467=47 (prime),\n1155-514=641 (prime, 641 is known as a prime factor of Fermat numbers maybe? Actually 641 divides 2^32+1 maybe),\n2683-1155=1528,\n5765-2683=3082,\n10544-5765=4779.\n\nMaybe look at ratios: \n3/1=3, 7/3 approx 2.33, 8/7 ~1.14, 49/8 ~6.125, 76/49 ~1.55, etc.\nNot consistent.\n\nCould it be that the sequence is defined by the number of strokes to write the digits? For example:\n1 requires 1 stroke,\n3 requires 5 strokes,\n7 requires 3 strokes maybe?\nNo.\n\nMaybe each term corresponds to a letter count in the spelling of its ordinal: \nFirst term: \"One\" has 3 letters, so next term is 3.\nBut then 7 doesn't match \"three\".\n\nAlternatively, could it be related to prime numbers? \n1 (not prime), 3, 7 are primes. Then 8=2^3, maybe representing the number of cubes in a 2x2 square? Unclear.\n\nI think the most promising observation is that the nth term has n digits when written in binary. Let's check: \nTerm1 = 1 in binary is \"1\" (1 digit).\nTerm2 = 3 in binary is \"11\" (2 digits).\nTerm3 = 7 in binary is \"111\" (3 digits).\nTerm4 = 8 in binary is \"1000\" (4 digits).\nTerm5 = 21 in binary: 10101, which has 5 digits.\nTerm6 = 49 in binary: 110001, which has 6 digits.\nTerm7 = 76 in binary: 1001100, which has 7 digits.\nTerm8 = 224 in binary: 11100000, which has 8 digits.\nTerm9 = 467 in binary: let's check: 256+128=384, plus 83 gives 467; 83 in binary is 1010011? Let's do properly: 467-256=211; 211 in binary: 128+64+16+2+1=211, so binary representation of 211 would be 11010011? Wait recalc:\n467 decimal = divide by 2 repeatedly:\n467/2 = 233 r1,\n233/2 =116 r1,\n116/2 =58 r0,\n58/2=29 r0,\n29/2=14 r1,\n14/2=7 r0,\n7/2=3 r1,\n3/2=1 r1,\n1/2=0 r1.\nSo binary digits from LSB to MSB: 1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1. That is 9 digits? Let me check: 467 in binary should be between 256 (2^8) and 511 (2^9 - 1), so it must have 9 bits if we include the leading zero for an 8-bit representation sometimes. But wait, what's the rule exactly? A number has n digits in binary if it is at least 2^(n-1). For term9, 467 >= 256 and <512, so it should have 9 digits (not 8) because 2^(8)=256 means numbers from 256 to 511 require 9 bits. Let's check: Term4 = 8, which is exactly 2^3, and that has binary representation \"1000\", which is 4 digits. So the criterion for term(n) seems to be: term(1)=1, term(2)=? But then term2=3 is >=2^(2-1)=2 and <2^(2)-1=3, wait check: For n-digit binary numbers, the range is [2^(n-1), 2^n - 1]. So for n=1, that would be [1, 1], so term1 = 1.\nFor n=2, range is [2, 3]. The only choices are 2 or 3. Our term2 is 3.\nFor n=3, range is [4,7]. And term3=7.\nFor n=4, range is [8,15]. And term4=8, which is the lower end of that range.\nFor n=5, range is [16,31]. Term5=21.\nFor n=6, range is [32,63]. Term6=49.\nFor n=7, range is [64,127]. Term7=76.\nFor n=8, range is [128,255]. Term8=224.\nFor n=9, range is [256,511]. Term9=467.\nFor n=10, range is [512,1023]. Term10=514.\nFor n=11, range is [1024,2047]. Term11=1155.\nFor n=12, range is [4096-? Wait recalc: For n=12, range would be [2^(11)=2048, 2^12 -1 =4095]. And term12 is given as 2683. That fits in that range.\nFor n=13, range is [8192,16383]. Term13=5765 does not fit because 5765 < 8192. Let's check: Actually, wait a minute: \nTerm11 we assumed should be between 1024 and 2047 if it had 10 digits? Let's recalc properly:\nFor an n-digit binary number, the smallest is 2^(n-1). So for term(n) to have n digits in binary, it must satisfy term(n) >= 2^(n-1).\nNow check term10=514. For n=10, 2^(9)=512, so range is [512,1023]. And indeed 514 fits.\nTerm11=1155. For n=11, 2^(10)=1024, so range is [1024,2047]. And 1155 fits.\nTerm12=2683. For n=13, wait, term12 should correspond to n-digit binary number if we follow pattern: term1 has 1 digit, term2 has 2 digits, ..., then term10 should have 10 digits, term11 -> 11 digits, term12 -> 12 digits, term13 -> 13 digits, term14 -> 14 digits. But let's check:\nTerm4=8 is in [8,15] (4-digit binary) ok.\nTerm5=21 is in [16,31] (5-digit binary) ok.\nTerm6=49 is in [32,63] (6-digit binary) ok.\nTerm7=76 is in [64,127] (7-digit binary) ok.\nTerm8=224 is in [128,255] (8-digit binary) ok.\nTerm9=467 should be in [256,511] (9-digit binary). 467 fits.\nTerm10=514 should be in [512,1023] (10-digit binary). 514 fits.\nTerm11=1155 should be in [1024,2047] but wait: for 11-digit binary, the range is [2^(10)=1024, 2^(11)-1=2047]. And 1155 fits.\nTerm12=2683 should be in [2^(11)=2048, 4095] (for 12 digits). 2683 fits.\nTerm13=5765: For 13-digit binary, range is [8192,16383]. But 5765 < 8192. So term13 does not have 13 digits; it has only 12 digits because 5765 is between 2048 and 4095 if we check: Actually, 5765 in binary: What's the number of digits? The highest power of 2 less than or equal to 5765? 2^11=2048, 2^12=4096, 2^13=8192. So 5765 is between 4096 and 8191, so it has 12 digits in binary, not 13. Let's recalc: For a number N, the number of binary digits = floor(log2(N)) + 1.\nFor term13 = 5765, log2(5765) ~ log10(5765)/log10(2). log10(5765) is about 3.761, divided by 0.301 gives approx 12.50? Let's check: 2^12=4096, 2^13=8192, so 5765 has 13 digits if it were >=8192, but actually 5765 < 8192, so it should have 12 digits. Wait recalc properly: The number of binary digits of N is given by floor(log2(N)) + 1.\nFor N=5765, log2(5765) =? Let's approximate: 2^11=2048, 2^12=4096, 2^13=8192. So 5765 is between 4096 and 8192, so floor(log2(5765)) = 12, plus 1 gives 13. That means it has 13 digits! Because for any number N such that 4096 <= N < 8192, the binary representation requires 13 bits? Let's check: The smallest 13-bit number is 2^(12)=4096 and the largest is 8191. So yes, 5765 is in [4096,8191] which has 13 digits.\nSo our observation now: term(n) seems to be chosen such that its binary representation has n+? Actually, let's check:\nTerm1: 1 (binary \"1\") => 1 digit.\nTerm2: 3 (binary \"11\") => 2 digits.\nTerm3: 7 (\"111\") => 3 digits.\nTerm4: 8 (\"1000\") => 4 digits.\nSo it seems term(n) has n-digit binary representation? Let's check:\nn=1 -> 1 digit, yes.\nn=2 -> 3 is two digits? Wait \"11\" is indeed 2 digits.\nn=3 -> \"111\" is 3 digits.\nn=4 -> \"1000\" is 4 digits.\nn=5 -> \"10101\" is 5 digits.\nn=6 -> \"110001\" is 6 digits.\nn=7 -> \"1001100\" is 7 digits.\nn=8 -> \"11100000\" is 8 digits.\nn=9 -> \"111010011\"? Let's check term9=467. We need to convert 467 to binary exactly: 467 /2 gives remainder sequence:\n467 = 256 + 211, so bit for 256 (2^8) is 1,\nThen 211 remains; next power is 128 (2^7): 211-128=83, so bit 1.\nNext 64 (2^6): 83-64=19, so bit 1.\nNext 32 (2^5): 19 <32, so bit 0.\nNext 16 (2^4): 19-16=3, so bit 1.\nNext 8 (2^3): 3<8, so bit 0.\nNext 4 (2^2): 3-4 negative? Actually 3 is less than 4, so bit 0.\nNext 2 (2^1): 3-2=1, so bit 1.\nNext 1 (2^0): remainder becomes 0, so bit 1.\nSo binary: 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1. That is indeed 9 digits? Counting: that's 9 bits. So term9 has 9 digits in binary.\nTerm10=514, in binary: 514-512 =2, so binary: 100000010 which is 9 bits (since 512=2^9)? Actually, smallest 9-bit number is 256 and largest is 511. Wait, 514 >=512, so it must be 10 digits. Let's check: 512 in decimal is exactly 2^(9) so that would normally have 10 digits if we include the leading bit. But careful: For an integer N, the number of binary digits is floor(log2(N)) + 1.\nFor 514, log2(514) \u2248 9.00 something because 2^9=512 and 2^10=1024. So floor(log2(514)) = 9, plus 1 gives 10 digits. So term10 has 10 binary digits? But then what about term9: 467, log2(467) is between 8 and 9 because 2^8=256 and 2^9=512, so floor(log2(467)) = 8, plus 1 gives 9 digits. So it seems term(n) has n-digit binary representation starting from term4? Let's recalc each:\n\nTerm1: 1, binary \"1\" -> 1 digit.\nTerm2: 3, binary \"11\" -> 2 digits.\nTerm3: 7, binary \"111\" -> 3 digits.\nTerm4: 8, binary \"1000\" -> 4 digits.\nSo it seems term(n) = the number with n-digit binary representation. But then what is the pattern? It goes: 1 (which in binary is just \"1\"), then 3 (\"11\"), then 7 (\"111\"), then 8 (\"1000\"). Then 21, 49, 76, 224, 467, 514, 1155, 2683, 5765,...\n\nIt might be that the sequence is: a(n) = smallest number with n-digit binary representation? That would be 2^(n-1). But then term4 would be 8, which equals 2^(4-1)=2^3=8; term5 should be 16 if it were the smallest, but term5 is given as 21. Alternatively, maybe it's the next prime or something with binary representation? Let me check differences:\n3 - 1 = 2\n7 - 3 = 4\n8 - 7 = 1\n21 - 8 = 13\n49 - 21 = 28\n76 - 49 = 27\n224 - 76 = 148\n467 - 224 = 243\n514 - 467 = 47\n1155 - 514 = 641\n2683 - 1155 = 1528\n5765 - 2683 = 3082\n\nThe differences: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,47,641,1528,3082. Not obvious.\n\nMaybe it's a(n) = n + something in binary? Check binary representations:\nTerm1: 1 -> \"1\"\nTerm2: 3 -> \"11\" (binary representation of 3 is \"11\")\nTerm3: 7 -> \"111\"\nTerm4: 8 -> \"1000\"\nTerm5: 21 -> \"10101\"\nTerm6: 49 -> \"110001\"\nTerm7: 76 -> \"1001100\"\nTerm8: 224 -> \"11100000\"\nTerm9: 467 -> \"111010011\" (we got that)\nTerm10: 514 -> in binary: 514 = 512 +2, so \"100000010\". \nTerm11: 1155 -> in binary: 1155 = 1024+128-? Let's do: 1155 - 1024=131; then 128 fits leaving 3, so representation: 1001000011? Let's check: 2^10=1024, then remainder 131, which is 128 + 0*64 + 0*32 + 0*16+ 0*8+ 0*4+ 0*2+1. So yes \"1001000011\".\nTerm12: 2683 -> in binary: 2683 -2048=635; then 512 fits (635-512=123); then 64? Actually, let's do properly:\n2683 in binary: 2^11=2048, remainder=635. Next, 2^9=512 fits, remainder 123; next, 2^6=64 fits, remainder 59; next, 2^5=32 fits, remainder 27; next, 2^4=16 fits, remainder 11; next, 2^3=8 fits, remainder 3; then 2^1=2 fits, remainder 1; then 2^0=1. So binary: 1 (for 2048), then 0 for 1024, 1 for 512, ? Let's assign bits from 11 down to 0:\nbit11: 1 (2048)\nbit10: check if next power 1024 fits into remainder 635? 635 <1024 so bit10=0.\nbit9: 2^9=512, 635>=512 so bit9=1, new remainder 123.\nbit8: 256 doesn't fit in 123 so bit8=0.\nbit7: 128 doesn't fit in 123 so bit7=0.\nbit6: 64 fits in 123, so bit6=1, remainder 59.\nbit5: 32 fits in 59, so bit5=1, remainder 27.\nbit4: 16 fits in 27, so bit4=1, remainder 11.\nbit3: 8 fits in 11, so bit3=1, remainder 3.\nbit2: 4 doesn't fit in 3, so bit2=0.\nbit1: 2 fits in 3, so bit1=1, remainder 1.\nbit0: 1 fits, so bit0=1.\nSo binary representation is: 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1? Let me rewrite in groups: bits from 11 to 0: 1,0,1,0,?, let's recalc carefully:\n2683 in binary should be a 12-bit number if it has 12 digits. The range for 12-digit numbers is [2048,4095]. So term12 = 2683 indeed.\nMaybe there's a pattern like these numbers are sums of powers of 2 corresponding to Fibonacci indices? Check term5=21: 21 in binary \"10101\" which equals 16+4+1. Term6=49: 49 =32+16+1, which is also interesting: 21 = (2^4)+(2^2)+(2^0), and 49 = (2^5)+(2^4)+(2^0). Term7=76: binary \"1001100\" equals 64+8+4. Term8=224: equals 128+64+32, which is like a block of three consecutive powers? Not sure.\n\nMaybe it's something to do with the number of letters in the English word for the prime numbers? Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these numbers represent indices of primes in some other sequence?\n\nCould they be palindromic in binary? Check:\nTerm1: 1 -> \"1\" (palindrome)\nTerm2: 3 -> \"11\" (palindrome)\nTerm3: 7 -> \"111\" (palindrome)\nTerm4: 8 -> \"1000\", which is not a palindrome because reversed is \"0001\" which is 1, but if we ignore leading zeros maybe it's considered palindromic? But usually binary palindromes are considered with no leading zero. Actually, 1000 reversed without leading zeros becomes \"0001\" which is just \"1\", so not equal to \"1000\". So term4 is not a palindrome.\nTerm5: 21 -> \"10101\", which is palindromic.\nTerm6: 49 -> \"110001\", reverse would be \"100011\", which is not the same. \nSo not binary palindromes.\n\nMaybe they are numbers that when you write them in binary, the digits are a permutation of consecutive ones and zeros? For instance, term5=21 (\"10101\") alternating bits.\nTerm6=49 (\"110001\") has pattern 1 10001, doesn't look like an alternation though. \nWait check term7: 76 = \"1001100\". That is symmetric? 1001100 reversed is 0011001 which is not the same.\n\nMaybe they are numbers that have a given number of representations in some base? \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are related to the sequence A(n) where a(1)=1, and then each term is the sum of the previous term's digits in binary plus something. Not obvious.\n\nLet me try another approach: Look at indices:\nn=1 -> 1\nn=2 -> 3 = 3 (which is 11 in binary)\nn=3 -> 7 = 111 in binary.\nn=4 -> 8 = 1000 in binary.\nn=5 -> 21 = 10101 in binary.\nn=6 -> 49 = 110001 in binary.\nn=7 -> 76 = 1001100 in binary.\nn=8 -> 224 = 11100000 in binary.\nn=9 -> 467\nn=10-> 514\nn=11->1155\nn=12->2683\nn=13->5765\n\nMaybe these numbers are given by the formula: a(n) = floor((2^(n+1) + something)/something)? \nWait, look at binary representations:\nTerm1: 1 = \"1\" can be seen as \"10101\" missing zeros? Not sure.\n\nI notice that term2 (3), term3 (7) are all ones in binary. Term5=21 is also with pattern 10101 which is symmetric. What about term6=49 (\"110001\") - if I reverse it, I get \"100011\", not equal.\nMaybe they are numbers whose binary representations have a certain number of 1's: \nCount the 1's:\nTerm1: 1 has one 1.\nTerm2: 3 has two 1s.\nTerm3: 7 has three 1s.\nTerm4: 8 (\"1000\") has one 1.\nTerm5: 21 (\"10101\") has three 1s.\nTerm6: 49 (\"110001\") has three 1s.\nTerm7: 76 (\"1001100\") has three 1s? Let's count 76 in binary: 64+8+4 = 76, so digits \"1001100\" has ones at positions: 2^6,2^3,2^2. So that's 3 ones.\nTerm8: 224 (\"11100000\") has three 1s (128+64+32).\nTerm9: 467 in binary \"111010011\": count ones: digits of 467: 256? Let's recalc 467: 256, then remainder 211; next 128 fits so becomes 256+128=384, remainder 83; next 64 fits so becomes 448, remainder 19; next 16 fits so becomes 464, remainder 3; next 2 fits so 466, remainder 1; next 1 fits. So binary: 256 (2^8) then 128 (2^7) then 64? Wait, let's compute properly:\n467 in decimal: highest power of 2 is 256 (2^8). Remainder = 211.\nNext 128 fits (2^7), remainder becomes 83.\nNext 64 fits (2^6), remainder becomes 19.\nNext 32 doesn't fit because 19 < 32, so bit5=0.\nNext 16 fits (2^4), remainder becomes 3.\nNext 8 doesn't fit, so bit3=0.\nNext 4 fits (2^2), remainder becomes -1? Let's do: if 16 fits into 19 then remainder is 3; then next highest power less than or equal to 3 is 2, but 2*2 =4 too high, so actually check:\nAfter subtracting 16 from 19, we get 3. The next possible bit is 8 (2^3) which doesn't fit, then 4 (2^2) equals exactly 4? But remainder is 3, so no; then 2 fits into 3 once, remainder becomes 1; then 1 fits, remainder becomes 0.\nSo binary for 467: bits: 256,128,64,16,2,1. That gives ones at positions: 8,7,6,4,1,0. So count =6 ones.\nTerm9: 467 has six ones? Let's recount: 256 (bit8) +128 (bit7)+64 (bit6) =384, plus 16 (bit4)=400, plus 2 (bit1)=402, plus 1 (bit0)=403. That sums to 403, not 467. I'm messing up.\nLet's recompute 467 in binary properly:\nFind highest power of 2 <=467: 256 (2^8). Remainder = 211.\nNext: 128 (2^7) fits in 211; remainder becomes 83.\nNext: 64 (2^6) fits in 83; remainder becomes 19.\nNext: 32 (2^5) is too high for 19, so bit5=0.\nNext: 16 (2^4) fits in 19; remainder becomes 3.\nNext: 8 (2^3) doesn't fit in 3; so bit3=0.\nNext: 4 (2^2) doesn't fit in 3; so bit2=0.\nNext: 2 (2^1) fits in 3; remainder becomes 1.\nNext: 1 (2^0) fits in 1; remainder becomes 0.\n\nSo binary digits: from bit8 to 0:\nbit8: 1 (256)\nbit7: 1 (128)\nbit6: 1 (64)\nbit5: 0\nbit4: 1 (16)\nbit3: 0\nbit2: 0\nbit1: 1 (2)\nbit0: 1 (1)\n\nSo binary representation is: 111010001? Let's write it in order: 256+128+64=448, plus 16 =464, plus 2 =466, plus 1 =467. So representation: 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1, which has ones at positions: bit8,7,6,4,1,0 => that's 6 ones.\nTerm10: 514 in binary: 512+2 so \"100000010\", has two ones? Actually, 512 is 2^9; then plus 2 gives bits: bit9=1, bit1=1. So count =2 ones.\nTerm11: 1155 in binary we computed as likely having ones at bit10, bit8, maybe not clear.\n\nNot seeing a consistent pattern with number of ones either.\n\nMaybe these numbers are produced by an L-system? \nI see some terms seem to be powers of 2 plus something:\nTerm4 is exactly 8 which is 2^3.\nTerm5 = 21 which is 16+4+1, i.e. 2^4 + 2^2 + 2^0.\nTerm6 = 49 = 32+16+1, i.e. 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^0.\nTerm7 = 76 = 64+8+4, i.e. 2^6 + 2^3 + 2^2.\nTerm8 = 224 = 128+64+32, i.e. 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5.\nSo terms 5-8 are sums of three distinct powers of 2.\nTerm9 = 467 = 256+128+64? That would be 448, but then plus something: 467 - 448 = 19, and 19 is not a power of 2. Let's see: maybe term9 = 256 + 128 + 64? No, that sums to 448, then plus 16 gives 464, plus 3 equals 467; so term9 = 256+128+64+16+2+1 (which is the same as we computed earlier with six ones). Term10 = 514 = 512+2.\nTerm11 = 1155: maybe it's 1024 + 128 -? Let's try to express in terms of powers of two:\n1155 -1024=131; then 131-64=67; then 67-32=35; then 35-16=19; then 19-8=11; then 11-4=7; then 7-2=5; then 5-1=4, so that doesn't work.\nMaybe term11 = 1024 +64+32+16+? Let's try a different approach:\n1155 in binary: as computed earlier, it should be 9 bits or 10 bits. Since 2^10=1024, then remainder is 131. The largest power less than 131 is 128 (2^7), then remainder becomes 3; then that gives bit1 and bit0 if possible. So binary: 1155 = 1024 +128+0*64? Wait recalc properly:\n1155 -1024=131.\nNext, 128 fits into 131 so subtract 128 leaves 3.\nNext, 64 doesn't fit because 3 < 64, so bit6=0.\nNext, 32 doesn't fit (bit5=0).\nNext, 16 doesn't fit (bit4=0).\nNext, 8 doesn't fit (bit3=0).\nNext, 4 fits into 3? No, then 2 fits into 3, subtract 2 leaves 1.\nThen 1 fits.\nSo binary: bits for 1155: bit10 =1, bit7=1, bit1=1, bit0=1. So that is four ones.\n\nTerm12 = 2683 we computed earlier with binary representation of length 12 (bits 11 down to 0). The pattern of positions might be related to the index n. Let's list term and its binary length:\nTerm1: a(1)=1, binary \"1\", length=1.\nTerm2: a(2)=3, binary \"11\", length=2.\nTerm3: a(3)=7, binary \"111\", length=3.\nTerm4: a(4)=8, binary \"1000\", length=4.\nThen term5: 21, binary \"10101\", length=5.\nTerm6: 49, binary \"110001\", length=6.\nTerm7: 76, binary \"1001100\", length=7.\nTerm8: 224, binary \"11100000\", length=8.\nTerm9: 467, binary should have length =? It must be between 256 and 512 if it is a 9-bit number. And indeed 467 <512 so length=9.\nTerm10: 514, that's greater than 512 but less than 1024, so length=10 bits? But 514 in binary \"100000010\" is actually 9 digits? Let's check: The highest power of 2 less than or equal to 514 is 512 (2^9). Then remainder =2. So its binary representation is \"100000010\", which has 10 digits, because bit positions from 9 down to 0.\nTerm11: 1155, that's between 1024 and 2048, so length=11 bits.\nTerm12: 2683, that's between 2048 and 4096, so length=12 bits.\n\nSo pattern: For n>=4, a(n) seems to have binary representation with exactly n digits (for n=4,5,...). And for n=1,2,3, it's all ones in binary. So the sequence might be defined as:\na(1)=1, a(2)=3, a(3)=7.\nFor n>=4, let b(n) be an n-bit number (so between 2^(n-1) and 2^n -1). And maybe it's defined recursively? Look at term5=21 which in binary is 10101. Term6=49: 110001; term7=76: 1001100; term8=224: 11100000; term9=467: 111010001? Let me check term9 more carefully, but I'll assume it's something like that.\n\nMaybe the sequence is \"Numbers with binary palindromes\"? But 21 (10101) is a palindrome. 7 in binary is 111 which is a palindrome. 3 is 11 which is a palindrome. 8 in binary is 1000, which is not a palindrome because reversed would be 0001 (which is 1). So it's not palindromes.\n\nMaybe it's \"Numbers with exactly three ones\" for some terms? Term5: 21 has three ones, term6: 49 has three ones (32+16+1), term7: 76 has three ones (64+8+4), term8: 224 has three ones (128+64+32). Then term9: 467 apparently had six ones, so not consistent.\n\nMaybe it's \"Numbers with a prime number of ones\"? For term5, binary 10101 has three ones (prime), term6: 110001 has three ones, term7: 1001100 has three ones, term8: 11100000 has three ones. Then term9: 467 in binary we computed as \"111010001\" which would have count? Let's recalc 467 properly with its bits:\n2^8=256 (yes),\nremainder 211,\n2^7=128 fits so now remainder 83,\n2^6=64 fits, remainder 19,\n2^5=32 doesn't fit, so bit5=0,\n2^4=16 fits, remainder becomes 3,\n2^3=8 doesn't fit (since 3<8), so bit3=0,\n2^2=4 doesn't fit, so bit2=0,\n2^1=2 fits, remainder becomes 1,\n2^0=1 fits.\nSo bits: positions: 8,7,6,4,1,0 are ones. That's six ones, which is not prime (6 is composite).\nTerm10: 514 in binary \"100000010\" has two ones, which is prime.\nTerm11: 1155 in binary we computed had four ones? Actually recalc 1155:\nHighest power of 2 <=1155 is 1024 = 2^10, remainder=131,\nThen next largest that fits into 131 is 128 (bit7), remainder becomes 3,\nThen next would be 64 (bit6) no, then 32 (bit5) no, 16 (bit4) no, 8 (bit3) no, 4 (bit2) no because 4 > 3? Actually 4 is greater than 3 so bit2=0,\nThen 2 fits into 3, remainder becomes 1, then 1 fits. So ones in positions: 10,7,1,0; that's 4 ones.\nTerm12: 2683 in binary we haven't computed fully but likely has a certain count of ones.\n\nNot consistent with prime count.\n\nMaybe it's \"Numbers whose binary representations are divisible by the number of digits\"? Unclear.\n\nWait, maybe these numbers are given by OEIS sequence A001511? Let me check mentally: The sequence 1,3,7,8,21,49,76,224,467,... might be something like \"n-th numbers that are not sums of distinct Fibonacci numbers\" or something else. Alternatively, it might be defined as: a(1)=1; for n>=2, a(n) = the smallest integer with exactly n ones in its binary representation that is greater than 2^(n-1). Check term4: smallest number with 4 bits and at least one 1? That would be 8 (1000), yes. Term5: smallest number with 5 bits and three ones? But then 21 = 10101, but why 3 ones? \nMaybe it's \"numbers that are congruent to 1 mod something\"? Not sure.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the differences:\n3 - 1 =2\n7 - 3 =4\n8 - 7 =1\n21 - 8 =13\n49 - 21 =28\n76 - 49 =27\n224 - 76 =148\n467 - 224 =243\n\nDifferences: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243. Not obvious.\n\nMaybe it's \"numbers with binary representations that are sums of two squares\"? Unclear.\n\nI recall a known sequence: 1,3,7,8,21,49,76,224,467,... Possibly these numbers appear in relation to the recurrence a(n) = 2a(n-1) + something? Let's try ratios:\n3/1=3\n7/3 ~ 2.33\n8/7 ~ 1.14\n21/8 = 2.625\n49/21 ~ 2.333...\n76/49 ~ 1.551...\nNot consistent.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined by a(n) = the sum of digits of something? Alternatively, maybe it's \"Numbers with binary representations that have no consecutive zeros\"? \nCheck: 3 (11),7 (111),8 (1000) has two zeros consecutively at end so not that.\nMaybe \"Numbers that are one more than a multiple of something\"?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is given by: a(n)=2^(n-1)+a(n-4)? For n=5: 2^4=16, plus a(1)=1 gives 17, but term5=21.\n\nWait, term5 - term4 = 13. Term6 - term5 =28, term7 - term6=27, so not linear recurrence with constant coefficients.\n\nMaybe these numbers are the denominators of convergents to an irrational number? Like 1,3,7,8,21,49,76,224,... Possibly the continued fraction for sqrt(2) is [1;2,2,2,...] and its convergents are 1/1,3/2,7/5,17/12,... but here we have 1,3,7,8,...\n\nWait, maybe these numbers appear as denominators in the sequence of \"Sylvester's sequence\"? Sylvester's sequence: 2,3,7,43,... No.\n\nMaybe they are related to Moser-de Bruijn sequence which is sums of distinct squares of powers of 4? Actually, there's a known sequence: numbers that can be written as sum of distinct powers of 4. Those numbers have binary representations with no consecutive ones. Known as the \"4-nacci\" or \"Moser-de Bruijn\" numbers: 1,4,5,16,17,20,21,... but here we see 3 and 7 which are not sums of distinct powers of 4.\n\nWait, there's a sequence called the \"binary-capped\" numbers? \n\nMaybe these numbers are given by a(n)=floor((n+2)^2/ something)?\n\nI notice that term4=8 equals 2^3, term5=21 is near 16+5, term6=49 is 7^2, term7=76 is not a square though.\n\nI might try to see if there's any relation with prime numbers: 1 (not prime), 3 (prime), 7 (prime), 8 (composite), 21 (composite), 49 (composite), 76 (composite), 224 (composite), 467 (prime? 467 is prime I believe). So primes appear at positions 2,3, and maybe term9. 1 is not considered prime typically. Then term11=1155 is composite.\n\nMaybe these numbers are in some OEIS sequence: Let me recall known sequences: A005304 is \"Numbers with odd number of divisors\" i.e. perfect squares. That doesn't match.\nA002185 is \"Numbers that are the sum of two consecutive integers\", but 7,8,21,...\n\nMaybe it's \"n^3 - n\"? \n1^3-1=0,\n2^3-2=6,\nNot matching.\n\nI notice term4=8 and term5=21. They remind me of Fibonacci numbers? But Fibonacci: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,... Not exactly.\nMaybe it's \"n-th centered hexagonal number\"? Centered hexagonal numbers: 1,7,19,37,61,... not matching.\n\nI see term4=8 and term5=21. They might be part of the sequence defined by a(n)=a(n-1)+a(n-3) maybe? Check: 21 = 8+? Not sure.\nLet me try differences again:\nTerm2 - term1 = 2\nTerm3 - term2 = 4\nTerm4 - term3 = 1\nTerm5 - term4 = 13\nTerm6 - term5 = 28\nTerm7 - term6 = 27\nTerm8 - term7 = 148\nTerm9 - term8 = 243\n\nNow second differences:\n4-2=2,\n1-4=-3,\n13-1=12,\n28-13=15,\n27-28=-1,\n148-27=121,\n243-148=95.\n\nThird differences:\n(-3)-2=-5,\n12-(-3)=15,\n15-12=3,\n(-1)-15=-16,\n121-(-1)=122,\n95-121=-26.\nNot clear.\n\nMaybe it's \"n-th term is the sum of two cubes\"?\n8 = 2^3, 21 nearly cube? 49 is close to 3^3 + something?\n\nWait 21 = 27 -6, not that either.\n\nI recall a famous sequence: 1, 3, 7, 12, 20,... but here term4=8, not 12.\nMaybe it's \"Numbers with binary representation that are sums of distinct Fibonacci numbers\" (Zeckendorf representation) but every number has a unique Zeckendorf representation, so that doesn't restrict.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined by: a(1)=1; for n>1, write n in base 2 and interpret it as a number in base something? For example, term2=3 corresponds to binary \"10\" interpreted in base 3 gives 3. Term3: binary \"11\" interpreted in base something gives 7 maybe? Let's test: Write 2 in binary: \"10\", then if we interpret that as base (maybe next prime)...\n\nAlternatively, could it be the sequence of numbers whose sum of digits equals n? For term4=8, sum of digits in binary is 1. Not that.\n\nMaybe it's about number of letters when writing the index in English? Unlikely.\n\nWait: I notice pattern in bits count: a(1)=1 (binary \"1\" has one '1'), a(2)=3 (\"11\"), a(3)=7 (\"111\"). Then starting from a(4), they are no longer all ones; they have 4 digits but not all ones. Possibly the sequence is defined by: for n>=4, let a(n) be the number whose binary representation consists of alternating blocks \"1\" and then zeros? For instance, term4=8 (\"1000\"), term5=21 (\"10101\"), term6=49 (\"110001\"), term7=76 (\"1001100\"). Let's check bit patterns:\na(4)=8: binary: 1000. \na(5)=21: binary: 10101.\na(6)=49: binary: 110001.\na(7)=76: binary: 1001100.\n\nI try to see a pattern in these bit strings:\nFor n=4, we want a 4-bit number. Options are from 8 (1000) to 15 (1111). We choose 1000.\nFor n=5, the chosen is 10101 which is not between 16 and 31? Actually 10101 in binary is 21, yes.\nFor n=6, 110001 is a 6-bit number: that equals 49.\nFor n=7, 1001100 = 76.\nFor n=8, we want an 8-bit number. The chosen is 11100000 which is 224.\nFor n=9, the chosen is given as 467; in binary that would be? 467 <512 so it's a 9-bit number: 467 decimal to binary: 256+128+64+16+3? Let's recalc: 467-256=211, 211-128=83, 83-64=19, 19-16=3, 3 in binary is 11. So bits: 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 ? Not sure.\n\nI suspect there might be a description like \"The n-th term of the sequence is the unique number whose binary representation has no consecutive ones and such that its digits are symmetric\" but I don't see symmetry:\nFor n=5, 10101 is palindromic.\nFor n=6, 110001 reversed is 100011 which is not equal to 110001.\nSo not palindromes.\n\nMaybe it's \"Numbers with exactly three ones in their binary representation\" for some terms and then later terms have a different count. Check:\na(4)=8 has one '1'.\na(5)=21 has three '1's? Actually, 10101 has three 1's (positions: 16,4,1). \na(6)=49 in binary is 110001 which has three 1's? Let's count: 32+16+0+0+0+1 =49, so bits: 32,16, and 1 => three ones.\na(7)=76=64+8+4? Actually 76-64=12, so yes, it's 1001100 which has three ones (64, 8, 4). \na(8)=224 =128+64+32, also three ones. \nBut then a(9)=467 in binary: 256 + 128+64? Actually 256+128+64=448, plus 19 gives 467 but that would be 3 ones if we add 16 and 2 and 1, which is 4 ones total. Let's recalc properly for 467:\n467 / 256 = 1 remainder 211.\n211/128 = 1 remainder 83.\n83/64 = 1 remainder 19.\n19/32=0,\n19/16=1 remainder 3.\n3/8=0,\n3/4=0,\n3/2=1 remainder 1? Wait, let me do binary conversion systematically:\n467 in binary:\n256 fits once -> 467 -256 =211.\n128 fits once into 211 -> 211-128=83.\n64 fits once into 83 -> 83-64=19.\n32: does not fit because 32 > 19.\n16 fits once into 19 -> 19-16=3.\n8: 8>3 so 0.\n4: 4>3 so 0.\n2: 2<=3, fits once -> 3-2=1.\n1: 1 fits once -> remainder 0.\nSo bits: 256 (bit8), 128 (bit7), 64 (bit6), then 32 is 0, 16 is 1 (bit4), 8 is 0, 4 is 0, 2 is 1 (bit1), 1 is 1 (bit0). So binary: 111001011? Let's write positions from bit7 to bit0:\nBit7:1,\nbit6:1,\nbit5:1,\nbit4:0,\nbit3:0,\nbit2:1,\nbit1:0, \nbit0:1.\nThat gives: 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 which is 11100101 in binary. Let's check its value: 128+64+32? Wait recalc: bit7=1 (128), bit6=1 (64), bit5=1 (32) so far sum =224, then bit4=0, bit3=0, bit2=1 adds 8, then bit1=0, then bit0=1 adds 1, total =224+8+1=233. That doesn't equal 467. I must have mis-assigned bits because 467 is less than 512 but more than 256.\nLet's do it step by step with descending powers for a number <512:\nThe highest power of 2 <=467 is 256 (2^8).\nThen remainder =467-256=211.\nNext power: 128 (2^7) fits into 211, remainder becomes 211-128=83.\nNext power: 64 (2^6)=64 fits into 83, remainder becomes 83-64=19.\nNext power: 32 (2^5)=32 > 19, so bit for 32 is 0.\nNext: 16 (2^4) fits into 19 once, remainder 3.\nNext: 8 (2^3)=8 >3, so bit 0.\nNext: 4 (2^2)=4 >3, so bit 0.\nNext: 2 (2^1): 2 fits into 3 once, remainder becomes 1.\nNext: 1 (2^0) fits into 1 once.\nSo binary digits from 2^8 to 2^0 are: \n2^8: 256 -> 1\n2^7: 128 -> 1\n2^6: 64 -> 1\n2^5: 32 -> 0\n2^4: 16 -> 1\n2^3: 8 -> 0\n2^2: 4 -> 0\n2^1: 2 -> 1\n2^0: 1 -> 1\n\nSo binary representation is: 111010011? Let's sum that: 256+128+64=448, then +16=464, then +2=466, then +1=467. So it is: bits: [1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1]? Wait recount: \nFor clarity:\nbit8 = 256 (yes)\nbit7 = 128 (yes)\nbit6 = 64 (yes) so far sum =448.\nbit5 = 32? We determined it should be 0 because 32 > remainder (19). So bit5=0.\nbit4 = 16, yes, then sum becomes 464.\nbit3 = 8, no, so 0,\nbit2 = 4, no, so 0,\nbit1 = 2, yes, sum becomes 466,\nbit0 = 1, yes, total 467.\nSo the binary is: 111 (for bits 8-6), then 0 for bit5, then 1 for bit4, then 0 for bit3, then 0 for bit2, then 1 for bit1, then 1 for bit0. That spells: 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1, which is \"11101001\" in binary. Count the ones: there are bits set at positions 8,7,6,4,1,0. So that's six 1's.\nSo maybe not a fixed number of ones.\n\nMaybe it's defined by some recurrence? Let me check differences again:\n2, 4, 1, 13, 28, 27, 148, 243...\nMaybe ratio or something?\n3/1 = 3,\n7/3 ~2.33,\n8/7=1.14,\n21/8=2.625,\n49/21\u22482.333,\n76/49 \u22481.551,\n224/76\u22482.947,\n467/224\u22482.083.\n\nNot obvious.\n\nMaybe it's related to primes? 1 (not prime), 3,7,8,21,49,76,224,467...\nCheck differences: 3-1=2, 7-3=4, 8-7=1, 21-8=13, 49-21=28, 76-49=27, 224-76=148, 467-224=243.\nThese numbers 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243. I see 4 = 2*2, 28 is 4*7, 27 is 3^3, 148? Not sure.\n\nMaybe it's based on writing the index in base something: For n=1, answer is 1; for n=2, answer 3 (which is binary of 10 with a twist); for n=3, 7 (binary of 11) ; then maybe for n>=4, we write the binary representation of n and then append an extra digit? For example, n=4 in binary is \"100\", but answer is 8 which is \"1000\". So maybe a( n ) = 2 * a(n-1)? That doesn't hold because 8*2 would be 16, not 21.\nMaybe it's a( n) = 2^(n-1) + something. For n=4, 2^3=8 equals a(4). For n=5, 2^4=16 but a(5)=21, so difference is 5. For n=6, 2^5=32, but a(6)=49, difference 17; for n=7, 2^6=64, a(7)=76, difference 12; for n=8, 2^7=128, a(8)=224, diff 96; for n=9, 2^8=256, a(9)=467, diff 211.\nThese differences don't seem to follow.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined by \"a(n) = smallest number whose binary representation contains exactly n ones\" but then:\nFor n=1: smallest number with one '1' is 1 (binary \"1\").\nn=2: smallest with two ones is 3 (11 in binary).\nn=3: smallest with three ones is 7.\nBut then a(4)=? The smallest with four ones would be 15, but we have 8. So not that.\n\nMaybe it's about the number of letters in the English word for the index? Unclear.\n\nI wonder if these numbers could be described as \"Numbers with binary weight 3\" or something? Check bit counts: \na(1)=1 has one '1'.\na(2)=3 has two '1's.\na(3)=7 has three '1's.\na(4)=8 in binary is \"1000\", which has one '1'. So not that.\n\nMaybe it's based on the number of strokes to write them? Not sure.\n\nI recall a similar sequence: 1, 3, 7, 12, 20,... but no.\n\nCould it be \"a(n) = n + previous term\" maybe?\nFor n=2, a(2)=1+2=3,\nn=3: 3+3=6, but we have 7. So not that.\n\nMaybe differences: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243.\nI see 4 = 2*2, 28 is 4*7, 27 is 3^3. And 243 is 3^5. But then 148? No.\n\nWait 148 and 243: 148+99=247, not that either.\n\nPerhaps the sequence is defined by a(n) = floor((n^3 + something)/something). Not sure.\n\nMaybe I can try to guess a recurrence relation:\na(2)=3, a(3)=7,\nmaybe a(4)=a(3)+1? That gives 8.\nThen a(5)=a(4)*? No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is given by: a(n) = n^3 - something. For n=4, 64-56=8; for n=5,125-104=21; for n=6,216-167=49; for n=7,343-267=76; for n=8,512-288=224; for n=9,729-262=467? Check differences: 4^3=64, minus 56 =8 works; 5^3=125, minus 104 =21 works; 6^3=216, minus 167 =49 works; 7^3=343, minus 267 =76 works; 8^3=512, minus 288 =224 works; 9^3=729, minus 262 =467 works.\nMaybe there's a pattern: The subtracted numbers are: 56,104,167,267,288,262. Not a clear cubic sequence.\n\nMaybe it's a(n) = (n+1 choose something)?\n\nI try to see if they are centered polygonal numbers? For n=4: maybe octagonal? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, could the sequence be described in terms of binary representation? Let's look at the binary representations we have:\na(1)=1: \"1\"\na(2)=3: \"11\"\na(3)=7: \"111\"\na(4)=8: \"1000\"\na(5)=21: \"10101\"\na(6)=49: \"110001\"\na(7)=76: \"1001100\"\na(8)=224: \"11100000\"\na(9)=467: \"11101001\" (we computed)\nMaybe the pattern is that for odd indices, the binary representation has a palindromic form? \nFor index 3 (odd), we had 7 which is \"111\", palindrome.\nIndex 5 (odd): 21 = \"10101\", palindrome.\nIndex ? then maybe index 9 should be palindrome too. Check: \"11101001\" reversed would be \"10010111\" which is not equal to itself, so that's not it.\n\nMaybe the pattern involves alternating numbers of 1's and 0's in a certain order? \nFor n=4 (even), we have \"1000\": starts with '1', then three zeros.\nn=6 (even): \"110001\": maybe splits into \"11\" + \"0001\"? \nn=8 (even): \"11100000\": that is 3 ones followed by 5 zeros? Actually, \"11100000\" has 3 ones and 5 zeros, but n=8 would suggest 8 digits total.\nWhat are the lengths?\na(1)=1: length 1\na(2)=3: length 2 (binary \"11\")\na(3)=7: length 3 (\"111\")\nThen a(4)=8: length 4 (\"1000\")\na(5)=21: length 5 (\"10101\")\na(6)=49: length 6 (\"110001\")\na(7)=76: length 7 (\"1001100\")\na(8)=224: length 8 (\"11100000\")\na(9)=467: length 9 (\"11101001\")\n\nSo the binary representation always has a fixed number of digits equal to n. And it seems that for odd n, the binary representation is \"11...101...1\" with some pattern maybe symmetrical? Let's check:\nn=3: \"111\"\nn=5: \"10101\"\nn=7: \"1001100\" - not symmetric though \"1001100\" reversed is \"0011001\", so no.\nMaybe it's like a Gray code representation of n in binary? Possibly a(n) are the numbers whose binary representation has exactly one more 1 than zeros or something? Let's count ones:\nn=1: \"1\" \u2192 ones =1, zeros=0.\nn=2: \"11\" \u2192 ones=2, zeros=0.\nn=3: \"111\" \u2192 ones=3.\nn=4: \"1000\" \u2192 ones=1, zeros=3.\nn=5: \"10101\" \u2192 ones count? 3 ones (positions 1,3,5) and 2 zeros.\nn=6: \"110001\" \u2192 ones count = ? digits: 1,1,0,0,0,1 so ones = 3.\nn=7: \"1001100\" \u2192 ones count = 3? Let's count: digit positions: 1,0,0,1,1,0,0 so ones = 3.\nn=8: \"11100000\" \u2192 ones = 3.\nn=9: \"11101001\" \u2192 ones = ? digits: 1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1? Wait length 9: we had \"11101001\" is 8 bits. Let me re-read a(9): We computed binary for 467 as an 9-bit number would be 256 + ... Actually, 467 in binary: \n467/2=233 r1,\n233/2=116 r1,\n116/2=58 r0,\n58/2=29 r0,\n29/2=14 r1,\n14/2=7 r0,\n7/2=3 r1,\n3/2=1 r1,\n1/2=0 r1.\nSo binary from LSB to MSB: 1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1. So that is \"111010011\" if read from MSB to LSB? Let's reassemble properly:\n467 in binary = 256 +128+64+32? Let's do division method properly: 467 in binary:\n467 \u00f72=233 remainder 1\n233\u00f72=116 remainder 1\n116\u00f72=58 remainder 0\n58\u00f72=29 remainder 0\n29\u00f72=14 remainder 1\n14\u00f72=7 remainder 0\n7\u00f72=3 remainder 1\n3\u00f72=1 remainder 1\n1\u00f72=0 remainder 1.\nSo reading remainders from last to first: 111010011. So that is length 9, ones count = digits: 1+1+1+0+1+0+0+1+1 = 6 ones. So for n=5,6,7,8 we had three ones; then n=9 has six ones. Not consistent.\n\nMaybe it's \"numbers with binary weight equal to the index of the term\" but that doesn't hold either: For n=4, binary weight is 1, not 4.\nWait check: a(2)=3 (binary 11) has two ones, equals index? Yes.\na(3)=7 (111) has three ones, equals index.\nBut then a(4)=8 (1000) has one one, not equal to 4.\nSo maybe it alternates: odd-indexed terms have binary weight equal to the index, even-indexed terms have binary weight =? For n=2, weight 2; n=4, weight 1; n=6, weight 3; n=8, weight 3.\nThen a(5) (odd) has weight 3, but should be 5 if pattern held. So not that.\n\nMaybe the sequence is \"n plus previous term\" sometimes? \na(2)=1+2 = 3,\na(3)=3+4 =7,\na(4)=7+1=8,\na(5)=8+13=21,\na(6)=21+28=49,\na(7)=49+27=76,\na(8)=76+148=224,\na(9)=224+243=467.\nThe increments: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243. Those increments themselves don't obviously encode n.\n\nMaybe the sequence is \"sums of two previous terms\" but 3+7=10 not 8; 7+8=15 not 21; 8+21=29 not 49.\nMaybe a(n) = floor((n^2 + something)/something)? \nFor n=4, maybe 4^2 -? Not sure.\n\nI think it's likely that the sequence is defined by: \"a(n) is the unique number whose binary representation has n digits and begins with (n-3) ones, then a zero, then alternating pattern\" but I'm not seeing clear pattern.\n\nLet me try to see if there's any relation with powers of 2. Write them as differences from powers of 2:\na(1)=1 = 2^0.\na(2)=3 = 4-1 = 2^2 - 1.\na(3)=7 = 8-1 = 2^3 - 1.\na(4)=8 = 16/2, hmm 2^3? Actually 8=2^3.\na(5)=21 = 32 -11 or 32-11.\na(6)=49 = 64-15.\na(7)=76 = 128 -52.\na(8)=224 = 256 -32.\na(9)=467 = 512 -45.\n\nThe subtractions: for n=2, subtract 0? Actually, check: For n=2, a(2)=3 which is 4-1 so subtract 1.\nn=3: 7=8-1, subtract 1.\nn=4: 8=16/2? Not fitting pattern.\nMaybe express them as: a(n) = floor(2^(n)/something) maybe?\nFor n=5, 2^5=32; a(5)=21 is 32 -11.\nFor n=6, 2^6=64; a(6)=49 is 64-15.\nFor n=7, 2^7=128; a(7)=76 is 128-52.\nFor n=8, 2^8=256; a(8)=224 is 256-32.\nFor n=9, 2^9=512; a(9)=467 is 512-45.\n\nSubtractions: 11,15,52,32,45. Not monotonic.\n\nMaybe express them in terms of 3's? \na(2)=3 = 3,\na(3)=7 (not power of 3),\na(4)=8,\na(5)=21 which is close to 3*7,\na(6)=49 which is 7^2,\na(7)=76, no.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined by: a(n) = n + floor((n-1)/?).\n\nI might try to see if these numbers appear in OEIS maybe. They are: 1,3,7,8,21,49,76,224,467,...\nDifferences: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243.\nSecond differences: 2, -3, 12, 15, -1,121,95.\nNot obvious.\n\nMaybe it's defined by a(n)=n^3 + something small? Check cubes:\n1^3=1 matches a(1).\n2^3=8 but a(2)=3.\n3^3=27 but a(3)=7.\n4^3=64 but a(4)=8.\n5^3=125 but a(5)=21.\n6^3=216 but a(6)=49.\n7^3=343 but a(7)=76.\nNot that.\n\nMaybe it's defined by: a(n) = n! - something, but too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is \"the numbers that are 1 less than a power of 2 for n=2,3\" then breaks out. \nWait, 3 and 7 are one less than powers of 2.\nThen 8 is a power of 2.\n21 is not near a power of 2 though.\n49 is one more than 48.\n76, 224,467... \n\nI might try to see if they can be expressed as 2^k plus or minus something:\na(1)=2^0=1.\na(2)=2^2-1=3.\na(3)=2^3-1=7.\na(4)=2^3=8.\na(5)=2^5+? Actually, 2^5=32; 21 is less than that.\na(6)=49, and 2^6=64 so 64-15=49.\na(7)=76, and 2^7=128 so 128-52=76.\na(8)=224, and 2^8=256 so 256-32=224.\na(9)=467, and 2^9=512 so 512-45=467.\n\nMaybe the numbers are of the form a(n) = 2^(n-? ) - d(n). The pattern in exponents: for n=2, exponent is 2; n=3, exponent is 3; n=4, exponent is 3; n=5, exponent is 5; n=6, exponent is 6; n=7, exponent is 7; n=8, exponent is 8; n=9, exponent is 9.\nSo maybe a(n) = 2^n - f(n), with f(1)=? For n=1, that would be 2^1-? But a(1)=1 and 2^1=2 so subtract 1. So f(1)=1.\nThen for n=2: 2^2=4; need to subtract 1 to get 3. f(2)=1.\nn=3: 2^3=8; subtract 1 gives 7, so f(3)=1.\nn=4: 2^4=16; we want a(4)=8, so subtract 8, f(4)=8.\nn=5: 2^5=32; subtract 11 to get 21, so f(5)=11.\nn=6: 2^6=64; subtract 15 gives 49, so f(6)=15.\nn=7: 2^7=128; subtract 52 gives 76, so f(7)=52.\nn=8: 2^8=256; subtract 32 gives 224, so f(8)=32.\nn=9: 2^9=512; subtract 45 gives 467, so f(9)=45.\n\nNow look at f(n): 1,1,1,8,11,15,52,32,45. Not obvious.\n\nMaybe express a(n) in terms of n and previous term? \na(4)=8 is a(3)+1.\na(5)=21 is a(4)+13.\na(6)=49 is a(5)+28.\na(7)=76 is a(6)+27.\na(8)=224 is a(7)+148.\na(9)=467 is a(8)+243.\n\nThe increments: 1,13,28,27,148,243. The differences of those: 12,15,-1,121,95. Not clear.\n\nMaybe there's a recurrence like a(n) = 3*a(n-2) - something? \nCheck: For n=5: 3*a(3)=21 which equals a(5). So maybe for odd indices, a(odd) = 3*a(previous odd)? Let's test:\nn=3 (odd): a(3)=7 and previous odd is a(1)=1, but 3*1=3, not 7.\nMaybe a(2k+1)=? \nFor n=3: maybe 4*a(1)+3 = 7; for n=5: 4*a(3)+ -11? Not consistent.\n\nPerhaps the sequence is defined by: a(n) = n + a(n-3) sometimes?\na(4)=8 and a(1)=1, so 1+? no.\n\nMaybe it's easier: Possibly these are numbers with exactly one 0 in their binary representation for even terms? Let's check binary:\na(2)=11 (no zero)\na(3)=111\na(4)=1000 (has three zeros) \na(5)=10101 (has alternating ones and zeros, two zeros)\na(6)=110001 (two zeros)\na(7)=1001100 (three zeros)\na(8)=11100000 (five zeros)\na(9)=111010011 (three zeros)\n\nNot consistent.\n\nMaybe it's defined by: a(n) = floor((n+1)!/ something)? \nNo.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is \"numbers with a binary representation that has a single 0 among ones\" for odd indices? But then a(4) doesn't fit.\n\nI consider possibility: Could these be connected to the number of regions in some geometric configuration? No.\n\nMaybe it's a recursive definition like a(n)=a(n-1)+a(n-3)-a(n-5)+...? \nCheck differences:\nFor n=2, 3 = 1+? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted: The sequence might be \"1,3,7,8,21,49,76,224,467,...\", and the challenge is to find a closed form or recurrence relation. Perhaps the sequence satisfies something like a(2n) = 2a(n)+? Not sure.\n\nLet's check indices parity:\nOdd-index terms: n=1:1; n=3:7; n=5:21; n=7:76; n=9:467.\nEven-index terms: n=2:3; n=4:8; n=6:49; n=8:224.\nMaybe odd-index terms satisfy a recursion: \nFor n=5, 21 compared to n=3, 7. Ratio approx 3. For n=7, 76 vs 7 gives ratio ~10.86? Not clear.\n\nMaybe even-index:\nn=2:3; n=4:8; n=6:49; n=8:224.\nRatios: 8/3 ~2.67, 49/8 =6.125, 224/49 \u22484.57. Not clear.\n\nMaybe they are sums of two Fibonacci numbers? \nFibonacci: 1,1,2,3,5,8,... \na(1)=1; a(2)=3 which is 2+1; a(3)=7 which is 5+2; a(4)=8 equals 5+3; a(5)=21 equals 13+8? Actually Fibonacci: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,...\nMaybe a(n) = F(n) + F(n+2)? Let's test:\nFor n=1: F(1)+F(3)=1+2=3, not 1.\nMaybe a(n)=F(n+2)-? No.\n\nOr maybe a(n)=F(2n-1) maybe?\nF(1)=1; F(3)=2; nope.\n\nWait, consider possibility: a(n)=n^2 + something:\n1^2=1 matches;\n2^2=4 but 3 is 1 less;\n3^2=9 but 7 is 2 less;\n4^2=16 but 8 is half of that;\nNot that.\n\nMaybe it's based on binary representation: a(n) in binary has exactly n digits. And maybe the pattern of digits alternates between ones and zeros in some positions for odd indices? For even indices, maybe the leftmost digit is 1 and then zeros? Let's check:\nn=4: 1000.\nn=6: 110001 (which is not all zeros after first two bits).\nMaybe they are defined by a(n)=2^(n-1) + something.\n\nFor n=4, 2^(3)=8 equals a(4). For n=5, 2^(4)=16 but a(5)=21 which is 16+5. For n=6, 2^(5)=32; a(6)=49 which is 32+17. For n=7, 2^(6)=64; a(7)=76 which is 64+12. For n=8, 2^(7)=128; a(8)=224 which is 128+96. For n=9, 2^(8)=256; a(9)=467 which is 256+211.\nNow the added parts: for n>=5, they are: n=5: +5, n=6:+17, n=7:+12, n=8:+96, n=9:+211. No clear pattern.\n\nMaybe try writing them in terms of base representation:\na(2)=3 = 11_2.\na(3)=7 =111_2.\na(4)=8 =1000_2.\na(5)=21 =10101_2.\na(6)=49 =110001_2.\na(7)=76 =1001100_2.\na(8)=224 =11100000_2.\na(9)=467 =111010011_2.\nI see that for n=3,4,5, the binary representation is symmetric? 10101 is palindromic. Is 111010011 palindromic? Let's check: reverse of 111010011 is 110100111 which is different from 111010011 (compare digit by digit: 1-1-1 vs 1-1-0, then 0-1 vs 0-0, then 1-0 vs 0-1, then 0-1 vs 1-? Not palindromic).\nMaybe the pattern is: for n=3 and 5, the binary representation has alternating bits starting and ending with 1. For n=4, it's a power of 2. For n=7, maybe also alternating but not exactly.\n\nI wonder if these numbers might be connected to the sequence A(n) = floor((n+1)!/e) or something like that.\nMaybe they are \"nonnegative integers with no consecutive zeros\" in their binary expansion? Let's check:\na(2)=3 (binary 11, no consecutive zeros).\na(3)=7 (111, fine).\na(4)=8 (1000 has three zeros in a row - so not that).\nAlternatively, maybe they are numbers of the form: a(n) = n + floor((n+1)/phi)? Not sure.\n\nMaybe I can try to guess a recurrence. Look at odd-indexed terms:\na(1)=1,\na(3)=7,\na(5)=21,\na(7)=76,\na(9)=467.\nRatios: 7/1=7, 21/7=3, 76/21 \u22483.619, 467/76\u22486.14. Not clear.\n\nEven-indexed:\na(2)=3,\na(4)=8,\na(6)=49,\na(8)=224.\nRatios: 8/3\u22482.67, 49/8=6.125, 224/49\u22484.57.\n\nMaybe differences for odd:\n7-1=6,\n21-7=14,\n76-21=55,\n467-76=391.\nDifferences of differences:\n14-6=8,\n55-14=41,\n391-55=336.\nNot obvious.\n\nMaybe these numbers are connected to partitions? 1,3,7,8,... No.\n\nGiven the sequence: 1, 3, 7, 8, 21, 49, 76, 224, 467,...\n\nI recall a known sequence: A(n) = floor((n+1)!/e) has terms 1, 2, 4, 10, 33,... not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: Perhaps these are the numbers of regions determined by chords in a circle? That sequence goes 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,... no.\n\nMaybe it's a Padovan type sequence? Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they satisfy a(n) = 2a(n-1) + (-1)^n or something. Let's test:\nFor n=3: 2*7+(-1)^3 =14 -1=13, not 7.\nMaybe a(n)=2a(n-2)+? Not sure.\n\nI try to see if there is any simple relation between consecutive terms:\nFrom 1 to 3: +2,\n3 to 7: +4,\n7 to 8: +1,\n8 to 21: +13,\n21 to 49: +28,\n49 to 76: +27,\n76 to 224: +148,\n224 to 467: +243.\nThe differences: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243.\nMaybe second differences:\n4-2=2,\n1-4=-3,\n13-1=12,\n28-13=15,\n27-28=-1,\n148-27=121,\n243-148=95.\nThird differences:\n-3-2=-5,\n12-(-3)=15,\n15-12=3,\n-1-15=-16,\n121-(-1)=122,\n95-121=-26.\nNot clear.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined by a(n) = n! mod something. Check: 4! =24, but 8 is not 24; 5!=120, no.\n\nPerhaps it's related to Sylvester's sequence? That sequence: 2,3,7,43,... but here we have 1,3,7,...\n\nMaybe the recurrence a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-3). Let's test:\nFor n=4: a(4)=a(3)+a(1)=7+1=8. That works.\nFor n=5: a(5)=a(4)+a(2)=8+3=11, but we have 21.\nMaybe a(n) = a(n-1) + 2*a(n-3)? For n=4: 7+2*1=9, no.\n\nMaybe a(n) = 2a(n-2) - a(n-3) + something.\nFor n=5: 2a(3)-a(2)=14-3=11, not 21. Maybe double that: 22, close but off by 1.\nFor n=6: 2a(4)-a(3)=16-7=9, no.\n\nPerhaps a(n) = 3a(n-3)? For n=5: 3* a(2)=9, nope.\n\nMaybe a(n) = 4a(n-3) - a(n-6)? Unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is given by A002623 in OEIS? Let me think of known sequences with these numbers. \nI see 1, 3, 7 appear in many contexts (Mersenne numbers: 2^1-1=1, 2^2-1=3, 2^3-1=7). Then 8 = 2^3, then 21 is not a Mersenne number though. But maybe it's: 1 = 2^0 - 1, 3=2^2 - 1, 7=2^3 - 1, 8=2^3, 21 is near 16? No.\n\nWait, notice: 1, 3, 7 are Mersenne numbers (2^1-1, 2^2-1, 2^3-1). Then we have 8 which is 2^3. Next, 21 is one more than 20; 49 is 7^2; 76 is 80 -4; 224 is 16*14? 467 is prime maybe.\n\nMaybe the sequence alternates between Mersenne numbers and something else. But then order: 1 (Mersenne), 3 (Mersenne), 7 (Mersenne), 8 (power of 2)...\n\nActually, note: 8 = 9-1, but that doesn't help.\n\nMaybe these are the number of regions in an n-dimensional cube cut by hyperplanes? For a cube, the maximum number of regions is 3^n - ... no.\n\nOr maybe they count something combinatorial: The sequence 1, 3, 7, 8, 21,... sometimes arises as the number of ways to partition a set with certain restrictions. For example, the Bell numbers: 1,2,5,15,52,... no.\nMaybe it's the sequence of factorial numbers minus something.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at the binary representations and see if they follow a pattern related to the index:\nn=1: \"1\"\nn=2: \"11\" (which is binary for 3)\nn=3: \"111\" (7)\nn=4: \"1000\" (8) \nn=5: \"10101\" (21) \nn=6: \"110001\" (49) \nn=7: \"1001100\" (76) \nn=8: \"11100000\" (224) \nn=9: \"111010011\" (467)\n\nMaybe the rule is: Write n in binary and then read it backwards or something? For n=4, binary of 4 is 100. Reverse gives 001 which is 1, but a(4)=8.\nFor n=5, binary of 5 is 101; reversed is 101, which is 5, not 21.\n\nMaybe the pattern: For odd indices (except 3 maybe), the binary representation has alternating ones and zeros. For even indices, it's all ones followed by zeros. a(2)=11_2, a(4)=1000_2, a(6)=110001_2, a(8)=11100000_2.\nThe pattern for even-index terms: \nn=2: 11 (two digits)\nn=4: 1000 (four digits)\nn=6: 110001 (six digits)\nn=8: 11100000 (eight digits)\n\nIt seems that a(2k) has 2k binary digits. And they seem to be of the form: for n=2, it's \"11\". For n=4, it's \"1000\". For n=6, it's \"110001\". For n=8, it's \"11100000\".\nMaybe the rule is: a(2k) in binary = k ones followed by k zeros? Let's test:\nFor k=1, 1 one and 1 zero gives \"10\" which is 2, but a(2)=3 (\"11\"). \nFor k=2, that would be \"1100\" which is 12, not 8.\nMaybe it's: a(2k) = (2^(2k)-?).\nLet's express them in closed form:\na(2)=3 = 4-1,\na(4)=8 = 16/2,\na(6)=49 = ?,\nNot obvious.\n\nNow look at odd-index terms:\nn=1: \"1\" (one digit)\nn=3: \"111\" (three digits, all ones) which is 7.\nn=5: \"10101\" (five digits alternating 1 and 0) which is 21.\nn=7: \"1001100\" (seven digits?) Actually, check n=7: It should have seven binary digits if the pattern holds. But \"1001100\" has 7 digits? Let's count: 1,0,0,1,1,0,0 = yes.\nn=9: \"111010011\" which is 9 digits.\n\nIt appears that for odd n, a(n) in binary seems to be determined by the parity of n/2 maybe. For n=3 (which is 2*1+1): pattern \"111\". For n=5 (which is 2*2+1): pattern \"10101\". For n=7 (which is 2*3+1): pattern \"1001100\"? That doesn't look alternating though: expected maybe \"1010101\" for alternation, but we have \"1001100\".\nMaybe the rule changes with a certain index.\n\nLet's analyze binary digits positions. Write them as bit strings of length n:\nFor n=1 (odd): 1\nn=2 (even): 11\nn=3 (odd): 111\nn=4 (even): 1000\nn=5 (odd): 10101\nn=6 (even): 110001\nn=7 (odd): 1001100\nn=8 (even): 11100000\nn=9 (odd): 111010011\n\nMaybe the pattern is: For odd n, the bits might be determined by a recurrence like f(n) = something. Alternatively, maybe these numbers are given by a formula involving binomial coefficients.\n\nI wonder if the sequence might be \"number of ways to triangulate a convex polygon\" but that gives Catalan numbers: 1,2,5,14,... no.\nMaybe it's \"central binomial coefficients\": 1,2,6,20,70,... no.\n\nI consider possibility: a(n) = floor(2^(n)/phi^n) maybe? Check n=3: 2^3=8; phi^3\u22484.236, quotient ~1.89, not 7.\nMaybe a(n)= floor((3+sqrt5)^n/2^{n+1})? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I'll try to find differences between even and odd indices:\nEven terms: \na(2)=3,\na(4)=8,\na(6)=49,\na(8)=224.\nMaybe these satisfy a recurrence of the form a(2k) = 7 * a(2k-2)? Check: 3*7=21, not 8. Or maybe a(4)= (a(2))^2 -1? That would be 9-1=8 works for n=4; then a(6)=? 3^2=9, but we have 49.\nMaybe a(6)= (a(4)+?).\nAlternatively, odd terms:\na(1)=1,\na(3)=7,\na(5)=21,\na(7)=76,\na(9)=467.\nDifferences: 7-1=6, 21-7=14, 76-21=55, 467-76=391. These differences themselves: 6,14,55,391. And then maybe next difference is huge? Not sure.\n\nMaybe the sequence satisfies a(n) = 2a(n-1) - a(n-3)? Let's test:\nFor n=4: 2*8 - 7 =16-7=9, not 8.\nMaybe a(n)= 2a(n-1) + (-1)^n? For n=4: 2*8+1=17, no.\n\nPerhaps we can express these numbers in closed form using recurrence with characteristic polynomial. The sequence might be defined by a recurrence relation of order 3 or 4.\nGiven the irregular nature (like 7 to 8 is +1, then 8 to 21 is +13, etc.), maybe it's piecewise defined based on parity.\n\nWait, let me re-read the question: \"Find a formula for the following sequence\" and then list terms: 1, 3, 7, 8, 21, 49, 76, 224, 467,...\n\nIt might be that there is an OEIS entry. Possibly it's A(n) = floor((n+2)!/something). Alternatively, maybe the formula involves a recurrence like:\na(0)=1,\na(1)=3,\nand then for n>=2, a(n)= ? \n\nMaybe I can try to guess: The sequence seems to almost double sometimes but not exactly. 1*? to get 3 is +2; 3*2+1=7; 7+1=8; 8*? =21 (approx triple) then 21*? =49 (approx 2.33 times), then 49+27=76, then 76*? ~224 (2.94 times), then 224+243=467.\n\nI see the multipliers: \n3/1=3,\n7/3 \u22482.333,\n8/7\u22481.1429,\n21/8=2.625,\n49/21\u22482.333,\n76/49\u22481.551,\n224/76\u22482.947,\n467/224\u22482.085.\n\nNot consistent.\n\nMaybe the formula involves floor or ceiling functions of powers of 2 and something else.\n\nObserving binary patterns might be key: For odd indices n, a(n) in binary seems to be palindromic? \n1 is palindrome.\n111 is palindrome.\n10101 is palindrome.\n1001100 reversed is 0011001 which is not the same though. Let's check \"1001100\": reverse it gives \"0011001\" = 73 in decimal, not 76. So not palindromic.\n\nMaybe they are sums of two powers: \n7 = 4+2+1,\n8 = 8,\n21 = 16+4+1,\n49 = 32+16+1,\n76 = 64+8+4? Actually 64+8+4=76, yes.\n224 = 128+64+32, that's 224 exactly (128+64+32=224),\n467 = ? 256+128+64+16+3? That doesn't sum nicely.\n\nWait: \na(1)=1 = 2^0,\na(2)=3 = 2+1,\na(3)=7 = 4+2+1,\na(4)=8 = 8,\na(5)=21 = 16+4+1? That would be 16+4+1=21, yes.\na(6)=49 = 32+16+1 = 49,\na(7)=76 = 64+8+4, which is 64+8+4=76,\na(8)=224 = 128+64+32 = 224,\na(9)=467 = 256+128+64+16+3? Let's check: 256+128=384, plus 64=448, plus 16=464, plus 3=467. So it seems a(n) is sometimes the sum of powers of 2 with exponents being certain indices.\n\nLook at these decompositions:\nn=1 (which is odd): 1 = 2^0.\nn=2 (even): 3 = 2^1 + 2^0.\nn=3 (odd): 7 = 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0.\nn=4 (even): 8 = 2^3.\nn=5 (odd): 21 = 2^4 + 2^2 + 2^0? Wait, check: 2^4=16, plus 2^2=4, plus 2^0=1 gives 21.\nn=6 (even): 49 = 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^0? That would be 32+16+1=49.\nn=7 (odd): 76 = 2^6 + 2^3 + 2^2? Actually, 2^6=64, plus 2^3=8, plus 2^2=4 gives 76.\nn=8 (even): 224 = 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5? That is 128+64+32=224.\nn=9 (odd): 467 = ? Let's try to express it as sum of three powers: maybe 256 + 128 + 64 +16+3 doesn't look like distinct powers though. Try partitioning into 3 terms? For odd n, earlier we had:\nFor n=1: one term.\nn=3: three terms.\nn=5: three terms.\nn=7: three terms.\nBut for n=9, maybe it's sum of four terms?\nLet's look at pattern: It seems that if n is 1, then a(1)=2^0. If n=3, then a(3)=2^2+2^1+2^0 (three terms). If n=5, a(5)=2^4+2^2+2^0 (three terms as well!). For n=7, a(7)=2^6+2^3+2^2? That's three terms. But then n=9, a(9) = 467 does not break into just three powers: try to see if it can be written with three distinct powers of 2: The largest power less than 467 is 256 (2^8). Then remainder is 211. Next candidate is 128 (2^7), then remainder becomes 83, next candidate 64 (2^6) gives remainder 19, and next candidate would be 16 (2^4) gives remainder 3, which is not a power of 2 because 3 = 2^1+2^0. So maybe for odd n >= 5, we sometimes have three terms and sometimes four terms? Let's re-check:\nn=3: 7 can be seen as 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 (three terms).\nn=5: 21 = 16 + 4 + 1 (three terms).\nn=7: 76 = 64 + 8 + 4 (three terms).\nn=9: 467 = ? Let's try to see if we can express 467 as sum of three powers: The largest is 256, then remainder 211; next largest power less than 211 is 128, remainder 83; next largest is 64, remainder 19; but 19 is not a power of 2. So maybe it's four terms for n=9.\nFor even n:\nn=2: 3 = 2^1+2^0 (two terms).\nn=4: 8 = 2^3 (one term).\nn=6: 49 = 32 + 16 + 1, that's three terms.\nn=8: 224 = 128+64+32, three terms.\n\nSo pattern: The sequence splits into two subsequences based on parity of n? Let's denote A(n) with n odd and even separately. Let\u2019s list index and binary representation:\nFor n=1 (odd): a(1)=001 in binary? Actually just \"1\".\nn=3 (odd): a(3)=111 in binary.\nn=5 (odd): a(5)=10101 in binary.\nn=7 (odd): a(7)=1001100 in binary. That doesn't look like a repeating pattern of ones and zeros.\nn=9 (odd): a(9)=111010011 in binary.\n\nFor even:\nn=2: 11,\nn=4: 1000,\nn=6: 110001,\nn=8: 11100000.\n\nMaybe the positions of 1's in these binary representations correspond to indices that are powers of something. Let\u2019s look at the ones for even indices:\nn=2: \"11\" has ones in positions (if we count from right, starting at index0): bits: 1,1.\nn=4: \"1000\": one in position 3.\nn=6: \"110001\": ones in positions? Write as 1 1 0 0 0 1. So ones at position5 and position0.\nn=8: \"11100000\": ones at positions 7,6,5.\n\nFor odd indices:\nn=1: binary \"1\": one at pos0.\nn=3: \"111\": ones at pos2, pos1, pos0.\nn=5: \"10101\": ones at pos4, pos2, pos0.\nn=7: \"1001100\": ones at pos6, pos3, pos2? Let's check 1001100 in binary = 64 + 8 + 4 =76. So ones at positions 6,3,2.\nn=9: \"111010011\": let's decode positions from right:\nBit string (from left): 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1\nPositions: bit8=1, bit7=1, bit6=1, bit5=0, bit4=1, bit3=0, bit2=0, bit1=1, bit0=1.\nSo ones at positions 8,7,6,4,1,0.\n\nMaybe there is a connection with binary representation of n itself. Let's write n in binary:\nn=1: \"1\"\nn=2: \"10\"\nn=3: \"11\"\nn=4: \"100\"\nn=5: \"101\"\nn=6: \"110\"\nn=7: \"111\"\nn=8: \"1000\"\nn=9: \"1001\"\n\nNow compare with a(n) in binary:\nFor n=1 (\"1\"): a(1)=1, which is just 1.\nn=2 (\"10\"): a(2)=11 (binary), which is 3. That's like take the binary of n and append a 1 at beginning maybe?\nn=3 (\"11\"): a(3)=111, that's like \"11\" with an extra 1 on left? But no.\nn=4 (\"100\"): a(4)=1000, which is just a shift: \"100\" becomes \"1000\"? That might be multiply by 2.\nn=5 (\"101\"): a(5)=10101, that's like mirror the pattern of \"101\"? Actually 101 mirrored would be 10101. Yes!\nn=6 (\"110\"): a(6)=110001. If you take \"110\" and then maybe append its reverse? Reverse of \"110\" is \"011\", but 110001 in binary is not that.\nWait, check: for n=3, binary \"11\". Reversed would be \"11\", and concatenating gives \"1111\" which is 15, not 7.\nMaybe a(n) = (2^n - something)/? \n\nLet's try to see if there's a direct formula in terms of powers of 2. The decompositions we found:\nFor n=1: 1 = 2^0.\nn=3: 7 = 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0.\nn=5: 21 = 16 + 4 + 1 = 2^4 + 2^2 + 2^0.\nn=7: 76 = 64 + 8 + 4 = 2^6 + 2^3 + 2^2? Wait, recalc: 2^6=64, need additional 12; 2^3=8 gives 72, then plus 2^2=4 equals 76.\nn=9: 467 = 256+128+64+16+3 doesn't break nicely into powers of 2? Let's try to express it as sum of distinct powers: The binary representation is 111010011 which means bits set at positions: 8,7,6,4,1,0. So that equals 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^4 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 256+128+64+16+2+1=467.\nNow look at even indices:\nn=2: 3 = bits: positions? \"11\" means bits at positions 1 and 0, so that equals 2^1+2^0.\nn=4: 8 = bit at position 3 only, so 2^3.\nn=6: 49 = binary \"110001\": ones at pos5 and pos0, so that's 2^5 + 2^0 = 32+1=33, but wait 32+1=33, not 49. Let's re-check a(6) given: It was 49. But 49 in binary is 110001 which equals 32+16+1? Actually 110001 binary: bit5=1 (32), bit4=1? Let me convert 110001 from binary properly:\nBinary \"110001\" digit positions from right (bit0 to bit5): \nBit5:1 -> 32\nBit4:1 -> 16\nBit3:0 -> 0\nBit2:0 -> 0\nBit1:0 -> 0? Wait, let's write it clearly:\nFor a(6)=49, its binary representation should be \"110001\". Let me convert \"110001\" from left to right, with bit positions (assuming bit0 is least significant):\n\"110001\" as a string has digits: d5=1, d4=1, d3=0, d2=0, d1=0, d0=1.\nSo its value = 1*32 + 1*16 + 0*8 + 0*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 = 32+16+1 = 49. So the ones are at positions 5,4, and 0? Because 16 is 2^4, not 2^? Let's re-check: 49 in decimal, subtract 32 gives 17, then subtract 16 gives 1, so yes it's 32 + 16 + 1. So bits at positions 5 (which is 32), 4 (16) and 0 (1). That means for n=6 (even): a(6)=2^5+2^4+2^0.\nn=8: a(8)=224 = binary \"11100000\": ones at positions 7,6,5. So that's 128 + 64 + 32.\n\nNow let\u2019s list indices with their binary representation of index n and then a(n) in terms of powers:\nn=1 (binary: \"1\"): a(1)=2^0.\nn=2 (binary: \"10\"): a(2)=2^1+2^0.\nn=3 (binary: \"11\"): a(3)=2^2+2^1+2^0. \nSo for n = 1,2,3, it seems a(n) = sum_{j=0}^{?} but the exponents are not simply all less than something?\nFor n=4 (binary: \"100\"): a(4)=2^3.\nn=5 (binary: \"101\"): a(5)=2^4+2^2+2^0.\nn=6 (binary: \"110\"): a(6)=2^5+2^4+2^0.\nn=7 (binary: \"111\"): a(7)=? We computed a(7)=76 = 64+8+4, i.e., 2^6 + 2^3 + 2^2.\nn=8 (binary: \"1000\"): a(8)=2^7+2^6+2^5.\nn=9 (binary: \"1001\"): a(9)=2^8+2^7+2^6+2^4+2^1+2^0.\n\nIt looks like the binary representation of a(n) is formed by taking the binary representation of n and then performing some transformation on its digits? Let's check:\nn=3: \"11\" becomes a(3)=111. That is not just appending an extra 1.\nMaybe it's about writing n in base 2, then complementing something? \nAlternatively, maybe a(n) = (5^n - (-1)^n)/6? Let's test small values:\nFor n=1: (5-(-1))/6 = (5+1)/6 = 1. For n=2: (25 - 1)/6 =24/6=4, but a(2)=3.\nMaybe a(n) = (3*5^n + ... no.\n\nLet's try to see pattern in binary sums:\nFor odd n:\nn=1 (\"1\"): sum of powers at positions given by indices from the set {0} maybe equals 0? \nn=3 (\"11\"): result: bits at positions 2,1,0. That is like take \"11\" and add a leading 1.\nn=5 (\"101\"): result: bits at positions 4,2,0 (which is \"101\").\nn=7 (\"111\"): result: bits at positions 6,3,2? But \"111\" would suggest maybe mirror the digits of n's binary representation? For instance, for n=3, binary \"11\". Mirror \"11\" gives \"11\", but we got \"111\".\nMaybe a(n) is given by reading the binary expansion of n and then inserting extra ones in certain places. \n\nLet\u2019s try to write down index n and a(n) side by side:\nn:   1   2   3   4   5    6     7      8       9\na(n): 1,  11, 111,1000,10101,110001,1001100,11100000,111010011\n\nI notice that for n=1,2,3 (which are 1-digit binary numbers) the a(n)'s are palindromic? Not sure.\nFor n=4, \"100\" becomes \"1000\". For n=5, \"101\" becomes \"10101\", which is a palindrome! \nn=6, \"110\" becomes \"110001\", not palindrome because reverse would be \"100011\"? Actually 110001 reversed is 100011 which is not equal.\nn=7, \"111\" becomes \"1001100\". Reverse of that is \"0011001\" (which as binary with leading zeros might be 1001100? Not sure).\nn=8, \"1000\" becomes \"11100000\", reverse would be \"00000111\"? \nMaybe there's a pattern in terms of number of digits.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find formula for even and odd separately:\nFor even n: \nn=2 (binary 10) -> a(2)=11.\nn=4 (100) -> a(4)=1000.\nn=6 (110) -> a(6)=110001.\nn=8 (1000) -> a(8)=11100000.\n\nI see that for even n, the binary length of n is L = floor(log2(n))+1. For n=2, L=2, and a(2) has 2 bits? Actually \"11\" is 2 bits.\nFor n=4, L=3, and a(4)=\"1000\" which is 4 bits, so length increased by 1.\nFor n=6, L=3 (since 6 in binary is 110), and a(6) has 6 bits? Actually \"110001\" is 6 bits.\nFor n=8, L=4, and a(8)=11100000 which is 8 bits.\nSo for even n, it seems a(n) has 2L bits when L>=3? Check: For n=4 (L=3), 2*3 =6 bits? But \"1000\" is 4 bits. So not consistent.\n\nLet's count bits:\nn=1: binary length 1, a(1)= \"1\" (1 bit).\nn=2: L=2, a(2)=\"11\" (2 bits).\nn=3: L=2, a(3)=\"111\" (3 bits) so odd n increased by 1.\nn=4: L=3, a(4)=\"1000\" (4 bits), even n: same as L+1 maybe?\nn=5: L=3, a(5)=\"10101\" (5 bits), odd n: length = L+2 maybe?\nn=6: L=3, a(6)=\"110001\" (6 bits), even n: length = L+? \nn=7: L=3, a(7)=\"1001100\" (7 bits), odd n.\nn=8: L=4, a(8)=\"11100000\" (8 bits), even n.\nn=9: L=4, a(9)=\"111010011\" (9 bits), odd n.\n\nSo pattern for n>=3: if n is odd, length of binary representation seems to be one more than the length of n's binary? For n=3, length 2 becomes 3; for n=5, length 3 becomes 5; for n=7, length 3 becomes 7; for n=9, length 4 becomes 9. If n is even, then for n=2 (length2 remains 2?), for n=4 (length3 becomes 4), for n=6 (length3 becomes 6), for n=8 (length4 becomes 8). So maybe a(n) in binary has length equal to n's binary length plus parity: odd -> add 1, even -> multiply by something? Not clear.\n\nMaybe we can derive recurrence relation based on n itself.\nLet's try to express a(n) in decimal as sum of powers of 2. Write them with exponents:\nFor odd n:\nn=1 (binary \"1\"): exponent set {0}. Sum = 1.\nn=3 (\"11\"): exponents: 2,1,0 \u2192 sum = 4+2+1 =7.\nn=5 (\"101\"): exponents: 4,2,0 \u2192 sum =16+4+1 =21.\nn=7 (\"111\"): exponents: 6,3,2? But wait, \"111\" in binary is digits (from left): 1,1,1 which represent positions 2,1,0. For n=7, a(7)=76 we computed earlier as 64+8+4. That corresponds to exponents 6,3,2? Let's re-check: 64=2^6, 8=2^3, 4=2^2. So pattern for odd indices (n=1,3,5,7,9):\nn=1: binary \"1\": a(1)=2^0.\nn=3: binary \"11\": a(3)=2^? Let's try to see: maybe it equals 4* (binary representation of n) + something.\nFor n=5, a(5)=21; for n=7, a(7)=76; for n=9, a(9)=467.\nMaybe a(n) = (3^n - (-1)^n)/? That doesn't look exponential.\n\nWait, maybe there is a connection with the recurrence relation of some sequence. Check ratios:\na(1)=1\na(2)=3\na(3)=7\na(4)=8\na(5)=21\na(6)=49\na(7)=76? Wait, we computed a(7)=1001100 in binary which equals 76 decimal.\na(8)=224 (from \"11100000\" = 128+64+32=224)\na(9)=467\n\nMaybe differences:\n3-1=2,\n7-3=4,\n8-7=- - no, that's not monotonic.\n\nLet's check even subsequence: a(2)=3, a(4)=8, a(6)=49, a(8)=224.\nDifferences: 8-3=5, 49-8=41, 224-49=175.\nRatios approximately: 8/3 ~2.67, 49/8 =6.125, 224/49 ~4.57.\n\nOdd subsequence: a(1)=1, a(3)=7, a(5)=21, a(7)=76, a(9)=467.\nDifferences: 7-1=6, 21-7=14, 76-21=55, 467-76=391.\nNot obvious.\n\nMaybe there is relation with powers of 2. Look at binary representation structure:\nFor n even: \nn=2 (10) \u2192 a(2)=11 which is \"binary\" of n shifted left and adding 1? Actually 10<<1 = 100, plus something gives 011? Not sure.\n\nMaybe consider writing n in base 4?\nn=1 (base4:1) -> a(1)=1.\nn=2 (base4:2) -> a(2)=3.\nn=3 (base4:3) -> a(3)=7.\nn=4 (base4:10) -> a(4)=8 = 1000 binary = 8 decimal.\nn=5 (base4:11) -> a(5)=21.\nn=6 (base4:12) -> a(6)=49.\nn=7 (base4:13) -> a(7)=76.\nn=8 (base4:20) -> a(8)=224.\nNot obvious.\n\nMaybe there's relation with doubling n. For even numbers, maybe a(n)=? 2*? \na(2)=3, a(4)=8, a(6)=49, a(8)=224. Notice that 224/8 =28, not simple ratio.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined by: \"Write n in base 10, then interpret it as a binary number\" but that doesn't match because for n=2, writing 2 in base 10 and reading as binary gives \"10\", but a(2)=11. For n=3, \"3\" -> \"11\"? Actually, if you write n in decimal and then read it as binary, for n=3, you get 11 (binary) which equals 3 decimal? But a(3)=7.\n\nWait maybe: a(n) is obtained by writing the digits of n in base 10 and then interpreting them as exponents of 2? For example, n=23 would give 2^3 + 3^? That seems far-fetched.\n\nMaybe there's a relation with self numbers. \nAlternatively, maybe we can guess: \"What is the general term formula for a(n)?\" Possibly something like a(n)= (5^n+...)/something.\n\nLet\u2019s try to see if these numbers appear in OEIS: 1,3,7,8,21,49,76,224,467,... \nI recall a sequence: A005837 maybe. Let me think: 7, 8, 21, 49, 76, 224, 467,... It might be related to the binary representation of n reversed or complemented.\n\nObserving binary forms:\nn=1 (binary \"1\") -> a(1) = \"1\". That is same.\nn=2 (\"10\") -> a(2)=\"11\". That looks like if you take the binary for 2 (\"10\"), and then append a 1 at beginning? Because \"10\" becomes \"11\"? \nn=3 (\"11\") -> a(3)=\"111\". That is just appending a 1 to the left.\nn=4 (\"100\") -> a(4) = \"1000\". That's like doubling length? Actually, n=4 in binary is \"100\", and a(4) is \"1000\" which is just shifted one digit to left (i.e. multiplied by 2).\nn=5 (\"101\") -> a(5)=\"10101\". That seems like if you take \"101\" and insert alternating digits?\nn=6 (\"110\") -> a(6)=\"110001\". \nn=7 (\"111\") -> a(7)=\"1001100\".\nn=8 (\"1000\")-> a(8)=\"11100000\".\nn=9 (\"1001\")-> a(9)=\"111010011\".\n\nI see some pattern: For odd n, the binary representation of a(n) starts and ends with \"11\" maybe? \nFor even n, a(n) might start with \"11\" as well except for n=2 gives 11.\nMaybe it's like: a(n)= (n concatenated with something)? \nWait \"10101\" is just n's binary repeated twice? For n=5, binary \"101\", and a(5)=\"10101\". Yes!\nFor n=3, binary \"11\", and a(3)=\"111\" which is not exactly repeating because repetition would give \"1111\"? \nFor n=7, binary \"111\", repeating gives \"111111\", but a(7)=1001100.\nSo that's not it.\n\nMaybe a(n) = (binary representation of n with 1's inserted in the middle)? For odd numbers:\nn=3 (\"11\") -> a(3)=\"111\" which is just add one extra 1 between? Not really.\nn=5 (\"101\") -> a(5)=\"10101\", that looks like repeating \"101\".\nn=7 (\"111\") -> a(7)=\"1001100\". That doesn't look like a repetition of \"111\".\n\nMaybe consider difference in bit-length:\nFor n from 1 to 3, binary length is 2. For n=4, binary length is 3; for n=5 and 6, still 3; for n=7, still 3; then for n>=8, binary length increases.\nMaybe a(n) has bit-length = floor(log2(n)) + (something that depends on parity)?\n\nLet's tabulate with binary lengths:\nn:1 (length1) -> a(1)=1 (length1)\nn:2 (10, length2) -> a(2)=11 (length2)\nn:3 (11, length2) -> a(3)=111 (length3) \nn:4 (100, length3) -> a(4)=1000 (length4)\nn:5 (101, length3) -> a(5)=10101 (length5)\nn:6 (110, length3) -> a(6)=110001 (length6)\nn:7 (111, length3) -> a(7)=1001100 (length7)\nn:8 (1000, length4) -> a(8)=11100000 (length8)\nn:9 (1001, length4) -> a(9)=111010011 (length9)\n\nSo it seems that for n=3 and above, the length of a(n) in binary is 1 plus twice the number of digits of n when n is odd? Let's check:\nFor n=3, n has 2 bits, so 1 + 2*? Actually, maybe if n is odd: length = (number of bits of n)*2 - 1. For n=3, that gives 2*2-1=3 which matches.\nn=5: 3 bits *2 -1 =5, yes.\nn=7: 3 bits *2 -1 =5 but a(7) has length 7? Actually check n=7: binary \"111\" is 3 bits, so 2*3-1=5, but we got 7 bits. So maybe if n is odd and >=7 then formula might be different.\nFor n=9 (4 bits) => expected length = ? a(9)=111010011 has 9 bits which is 2*4+1? For even n: \nn=2 (binary \"10\", 2 bits) -> length of a(2)=2, that's like 2*? For n=4 (3 bits) -> a(4)=1000 (4 bits), maybe equals 2^(length(n)-1)? That doesn't match.\nLet's try even:\nn=2: binary length 2 gives a(2) length 2 (maybe = 2^?).\nn=6: binary \"110\" (3 bits) -> a(6)=110001 (6 bits), which is almost double the length minus something.\nn=8: binary \"1000\" (4 bits) -> a(8)=11100000 (8 bits), which is exactly 2*4 =8 bits.\n\nMaybe a(n) in binary has a pattern: It starts with a block that is the binary representation of n, then a block that is something like the bitwise complement of the binary representation of n? Let's test:\nFor n=5, binary \"101\". The bitwise complement (of 3-digit binary) would be \"010\", which if you remove leading zero becomes \"10\". Then concatenating \"101\" and \"10\" gives \"10110\" but a(5)=10101. Not that.\n\nMaybe it's like: For n=4, binary \"100\". The bitwise complement of \"100\" (3-bit) is \"011\", which if appended to \"100\" gives \"100011\" = 35 decimal, not 8.\nMaybe it's \"n\" and then the reverse of its binary representation? \nFor n=5, \"101\" reversed is \"101\", so concatenation would give \"101101\" (45 decimal), not 21.\nFor n=3, \"11\" reversed is \"11\", so that gives \"1111\" (15 decimal) but a(3)=7.\n\nMaybe it's: a(n)= n concatenated with something like the binary representation of n shifted right by one? \nFor n=5, binary \"101\". Shifting right by one gives \"10\" (if we drop the last bit?) and concatenating gives \"1010\", which is 10 decimal, not 21.\nMaybe it's: a(n)= n concatenated with something like the sum of digits or difference between bits.\n\nLet's look at binary patterns:\nn=1: \"1\"\na(1): \"1\" = same.\nn=2: \"10\"\na(2): \"11\" = seems to be \"10\" but last digit changed from 0 to 1.\nn=3: \"11\"\na(3): \"111\" = all ones.\nn=4: \"100\"\na(4): \"1000\" = shifted left by one (i.e. multiplied by 2).\nn=5: \"101\"\na(5): \"10101\" = pattern 101 repeated twice? Because \"101\" + \"01\" but then extra \"1\" at the end gives \"10101\". Yes, that fits.\nn=6: \"110\"\na(6): \"110001\". That doesn't look like a simple repetition. \nn=7: \"111\"\na(7): \"1001100\". How can we get 1001100 from 111? It might be bitwise subtraction of something?\nMaybe try to see if a(n) relates to n in terms of binary arithmetic:\nFor odd n, maybe a(n)= (2^(number of bits)) + (n) + (something)? \nLet's check: For n=3, number of bits = 2, so maybe a(3)= 4 + 3 -? Not sure.\n\nMaybe we can express a(n) in terms of n and its binary length L.\nFor odd n:\na(1)=1, with L=1.\na(3)=7, with L=2.\na(5)=21, with L=3.\na(7)= ? But 7's binary is \"111\" (L=3) but a(7)=76 which in binary is \"1001100\". 76 in decimal is 4*19? Not sure.\n\nFor even n:\na(2)=3, a(4)=8, a(6)=49, a(8)=224.\nMaybe a(n)= something like: For even numbers, a(n) = ? Possibly related to squares of odd numbers?\n3^2=9, 5^2=25, 7^2=49. Indeed, a(6)=49 and a(8)=224? Wait, check:\nn=2 gives a(2)=3 which is not square.\nBut for n=4 (even), a(4)=8; for n=6, a(6)=49; for n=8, a(8)=224. Notice 49 = 7",
