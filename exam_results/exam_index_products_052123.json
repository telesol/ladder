Possibly the question is asking \"calculate f(n)\" maybe from some given values? It says: \"HYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\" Then check points:\n\n- k7 = ? x 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not integer) \n- k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28, that is k8 / 8 equals to 28.\n- k9: \"467/9 = 51.89\" not clean.\n- k11: \"1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\"\n- k12: \"2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\n\nSo apparently, it is observed that for some keys, if we divide the key value by n, f(n) equals an integer. For instance:\nk8 / 8 = 28, k11 / 11 = 105.\n\nIt then asks: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" I'm reading that the question wants to extract a function f from the keys?\n\nI think what's happening is we have some pattern: maybe there exists an index pattern where: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). Then using observations: For n=8, k8 = 28*8; for n=11, k11 =105*11.\n\nBut then also note that \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" i.e., k12 is given by (k8 * 12) minus 5. And also maybe k2 and k3? Let me re-read the question text: \n\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n\nIs there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)?\n\nCalculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nWe have keys: k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. And the observed ones are:\nk2 is used in the product with k3 to form k5? Actually statement \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" means that key 5 equals product of keys for indices 2 and 3. But then next observation: \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\", which implies k12 formula is from k8 multiplied by index, minus constant 5.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- It appears that the numbers provided correspond to keys in a sequence of primes? Possibly these keys represent prime numbers?\nBut then check: k2 = ? what is it? The question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" implies that maybe f(2), f(3), etc. But we only know some values: \nWe have:\nk8 / 8 = 28, so f(8)=28.\nk11/11=105, so f(11)=105.\n\nWhat about k7? They gave \"76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\" so not integer. k9 similarly is not an integer division result.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern that f(n) appears only when n divides k_n evenly. Then what keys have that property? According to check, we see:\nk8: 224/8=28 (f(8)=28)\nk11: 1155/11 =105 (f(11)=105)\n\nAlso they mention \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ?\" but then say k12 = k8\u00d712 -5. So if we write k12 in form f(12)*12+g(12) then f(12) would be what? They already computed that 2683/12 is not an integer. But since k12 equals k8*12-5, and k8=224 so then k12 = (28\u00d712)-5 = 336 - 5 = 331, but wait check: Actually they said \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" which gives 28 * 12 - 5 = 336 - 5 = 331. But then later \"2683/12 =223.58...\". Wait, there's a mismatch: They computed 2683/12=223.58 but then they claim k8\u00d712-5 equals 2683? Let's recalc: if k8 =224 then 224*12 = 2688 then minus 5 gives 2683 indeed. But 2683 divided by 12 is not an integer because 2688 would be divisible by 12, so it's one less than that? Let me check: 224*12=2688, subtracting 5 yields 2683, and 2683/12 equals 223 remainder something, so not integer.\n\nSo maybe there's a pattern for some keys that are multiples of n plus something. \nI see the question is ambiguous: \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" But which keys? Possibly we have keys k2, k3, etc.\n\nMaybe I'm supposed to look at the pattern: \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\". For some keys maybe f(n) might be computed as (k_n - g(n))/n. But then given examples:\nFor n=8, k8 is 224, so f(8)=28.\nFor n=11, k11 is 1155, so f(11)=105.\n\nI need to see if there's a relation among the indices that give integer quotient when divided by index.\n\nWe know k2 and k3 are used in product for k5. So maybe we have: k2 = ? Possibly these keys correspond to some sequence like factorial numbers? \nMaybe they are computed from prime indices or something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can deduce f(n) formula if there is a pattern.\nThe given example: k8 = 224 = 28\u00d78. And k11 = 1155 = 105\u00d711.\n\nI wonder if we have the following keys:\nk2 might be 3? Let me try to guess: maybe it's something like: k_n equals some function f(n)*n + g(n). They want f(n) for each key. But without additional context, it's hard.\nMaybe we can assume that when division yields integer, that is f(n)=k_n/n.\n\nWe are given:\n- For n=7, 76/7 = not an integer; so k7 = 76 does not fit the pattern exactly.\n- For n=8, f(8)=28.\n- For n=9, no.\n- For n=11, f(11)=105.\n- For n=12, doesn't yield integer quotient but can be expressed as (k8 *12 -5)\n\nMaybe there's a pattern: k_n might sometimes be the product of some other keys. Perhaps for prime numbers? There's \"k11 = 1155\", and note that 1155 factors as 3*5*7*11 maybe, because 3\u00d75=15; 15\u00d77=105; 105\u00d711=1155. And k8 is 224 which equals 7\u00d732? Actually 224 = 28*8.\nI recall: 224 factorization: 224 = 2^5 * 7 maybe? Let me check: 224/7 = 32, so yes, it's 7\u00d732 or 2^5 times 7. Meanwhile, 1155=3*5*7*11. And k12=2683, and notice that 2683 is also divisible by 7 maybe? Let me check: 2683/7 = 383.2857, no. \nAlternatively, note that f(8)=28 which might be 4*7 or something like that.\nMaybe there's some pattern linking indices to function values.\n\nLet me re-read the given text carefully:\n\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n\nIs there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)?\n\nCalculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nIt seems like the keys are being analyzed as numbers with an index subscript. Possibly these keys come from some puzzle where you have keys on a keypad maybe? \nPerhaps it is related to primes or factorial decomposition.\n\nI see that k11 = 1155 and note that 1155 factors as 3\u00d75\u00d77\u00d711, so f(11)=105 and g(11)=0? Because if we write k11 = 105*11 + 0 then 105*11=1155 exactly. Similarly for k8: 224 = 28 * 8, but that's 28*8 + 0, so then f(8)=28 and g(8)=0.\n\nThen what about others?\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. But we don't know k2 and k3 individually yet.\nMaybe they are primes? Possibly: k2 might be the prime number corresponding to index 2 which is 3, but then k3 would be the next prime, 5, product equals 15 but then k5 should equal 15; however, given text \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" but then check \"indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no\" indicates maybe not.\n\nMaybe they are numbers from a phone keypad where indices correspond to letters or something? \nWe have: k7 = 76 (if that is the key number for letter G)? But 76 divided by 7 is not integer; so then f(7) would be the quotient if division yields an integer. Here it doesn't, so maybe g(7) is nonzero.\nk9 = 467, but 467/9 \u224851.89, not an integer, so similarly for k12.\n\nMaybe we need to determine f(n) as the integer part of (k_n divided by n)? But then check: For k8, that gives 28; for k11, it's 105. \nFor k7, maybe f(7)=10 because floor division? But then remainder would be something.\nWait but question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" suggests we want to find the multiplier when you divide by n if possible.\n\nMaybe there is a pattern: For composite indices that are not prime or have certain properties, f(n) might be given by product of some subset of primes. \nLook at k8 = 28 and note that 28 factors as 4\u00d77 but also equals 2^2*7? Actually 28=4*7.\nk11=105 factors as 3*5*7 maybe.\n\nMaybe pattern: f(n) for prime n (n being 2,3,5,7,11,...)? \nCheck: k8 and k11 are composite numbers or possibly prime? Wait, which indices are primes? 2,3,5,7,11 are all primes. But then k8 is index 8 which is not a prime.\nWait, but our observed ones:\n- k7=76 (index 7 is prime, but division yields non integer)\n- k9: index 9 is composite? Actually 9 is not prime.\n- k12: composite.\n\nSo maybe f(n) only appears when the product of some keys equals something. The given examples that yield integer quotient are for n=8 and n=11. \nMaybe f(n) = (k_n - g(n)) / n, where sometimes g(n)=0.\n\nI hypothesize that there is a pattern: For indices 2,3,5,7, etc, maybe they follow a factorial-like or primorial pattern. In fact, note that k11=1155 can be factorized as 3*5*7*11? And k8=224 = 28*8 and 28 might equal something like 4*7. Not sure.\n\nPerhaps I recall a known puzzle: \"Key to the Kingdom\" or some similar puzzle with keys k2, k3, etc that are computed in various ways. Without additional context it's ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is: for any n where k_n can be written as f(n)*n + g(n) (with integer f and possibly nonzero remainder), then f(n) might be given by some product of previous keys? Because we see k5 = k2 * k3. Similarly, k11 seems like it's the product of some other keys? 1155 factorizes: 1155 / 11 = 105; further, 105 is 7*15 or maybe k8/8 =28 then plus something.\nLet me try to list what we know:\nIndices: \n- k2, unknown value.\n- k3, unknown value.\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. So if I denote f(2)=? and f(3)=?, but we don't have numerical values for k2 or k3.\n\nMaybe these keys are from a known sequence in a puzzle \"Prime Key\" where each key is computed based on the index. Possibly they come from the product of some digits? \nThe given examples:\nk8 = 224, and f(8)=28.\nk11=1155, and f(11)=105.\n\nI see that 28 = 4*7 and 105 = 3*5*7 maybe? And note: k2 might be 7? But then k3 would be something? \nWait, 7 appears in both. Possibly g(n) is always 0 for certain keys.\n\nMaybe pattern: f(11)= (k2 \u00d7 k3 \u00d7 k5 \u00d7 ...?) No, but k2 and k3 are not given.\nAlternatively, maybe these keys represent a permutation of digits from phone keypad letter mapping? \nFor example, key numbers might be the number of segments lit on a seven-segment display for each digit. But then indices 8 and 11: 224 and 1155 don't look like that.\n\nMaybe it's related to letters positions in the alphabet. For instance, k2 might correspond to \"B\", whose phone keypad code is 2; but then product of keys for letter D? Not sure.\n\nI think I'll try to see if there's a known sequence: The number 224 appears as a result sometimes (like 7*32). And 1155 factors as 3 * 5 * 7 * 11. And 2683 is k12, which equals 12 * 223 + remainder? Because 12*223 = 2676, remainder 7; interestingly remainder is 7 in that case.\nSimilarly, for k7: 76 divided by 7 gives quotient 10 and remainder 6 (because 7*10=70, remainder 6). For k9: 467/9 gives quotient 51, remainder 8 (since 9*51=459, remainder 8).\nFor k11: exact division yields quotient 105, remainder 0.\nFor k12: 2683 divided by 12: 12 * 223 = 2676, remainder 7. For k8: 224/8=28 exactly.\n\nSo the remainders:\nk2? unknown.\nk3? unknown.\nk5 = k2*k3, so f(5) would be (k5 /5)? \nMaybe if I assume that for primes f(n) and g(n) are determined by digits of n maybe?\nThe remainders: For index 7, remainder=6; for index 9, remainder=8; for index 12, remainder=7.\n\nI see pattern? Possibly g(n) equals (n-1)? Check: for n=7, n-1=6 which matches. For n=9, n-1=8, matches. For n=12, n-1=11 but remainder is 7, not match.\nMaybe g(n)=? For index 8, remainder 0 equals (8 mod something)? \nFor index 11, remainder 0 equals maybe? Not sure.\n\nWhat about f(7)=10 and then remainder 6; so k7=76. Possibly that could be expressed as 7*10 + 6, and note that 10 is one less than 11, which is prime after 7, but no pattern.\n\nFor index 9: k9=467 = 9*51 + 8.\nFor index 12: 2683 = 12 *223 + 7.\nFor index 5: We don't know actual value, but if it's product of k2 and k3 then maybe f(5) would be (k2*k3 - g(5))/5. Not clear.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that sometimes the index divides k_n exactly, and sometimes not, depending on whether the key is \"prime\" or \"composite\".\n\nIndices: 7,9,12 don't divide evenly. Meanwhile indices:8 and11 do.\nCheck divisibility: 7 does not divide 76 evenly, but 5 might? \nMaybe pattern: if index n is prime then k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) where f(n)=? Possibly f(prime) = product of previous primes up to a certain point? For instance, for prime 11, f(11)=105. And 105 equals product of 3,5,7 maybe. For index 7 (prime), f(7)=10. But that doesn't follow obvious pattern.\nMaybe f(n) for prime n: f(2)? f(3)? f(5)? They are not given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intended solution is to note that when division yields an integer quotient, that quotient is f(n). So answer: f(8)=28, f(11)=105. For others, it's messy.\n\nI might try to guess that maybe the pattern is that f(n) equals the product of all prime numbers less than n? Check:\nFor n=8, primes less than 8 are 2,3,5,7 which product would be 210, not 28.\nMaybe f(n)= sum of some previous keys?\nFor n=11, maybe f(11)= k2 + k3 + k5 + k7 + ... but unknown.\n\nI suspect the intended answer: f(n) is determined by dividing k_n by n when it divides evenly. For example:\n- f(8) = 224/8 = 28\n- f(11) = 1155/11 = 105\n\nBut then what about others?\nMaybe answer: \nk2 = ? Not given.\nk3 = ?\nk5 = k2 * k3 gives a pattern that might allow solving for f(5)=? If we suppose g(5)=0, then f(5)= (k2*k3)/5. But without knowing k2 and k3, can't compute.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intended answer is: \nf(n) = floor(k_n/n) when n divides k_n exactly, otherwise f(n) is defined by a different rule. Possibly:\nFor indices that are multiples of 7? Because remainders sometimes equal 6,8,7.\nI see remainders: for index 7, remainder=6 which is one less than 7; for index 9, remainder=8 which is 9 -1? For index 12, remainder=7 which is not 11 though. \nMaybe g(n) = (n-?) Not consistent.\n\nLet me try to see if k_n can be expressed as f(n)*n + g(n) where maybe f(n) equals the product of some previous keys' coefficients.\nFor n=8: 28 seems like it might be related to key 7? But we don't know.\n\nMaybe there is a known sequence: Key numbers might be the sum of digits of something. \n224 has digital sum 2+2+4=8, and index 8 equals digital sum maybe.\n1155 has digital sum 12 which doesn't equal index 11 though.\n2683 has digital sum 18, not 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps these keys come from a phone keypad where the numbers represent letters. For instance, \"k\" might denote \"key\", and the subscript is the telephone button. \nMaybe k2 is associated with ABC; k3 with DEF; k5 with JKL; etc.\nThen product: k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 could mean number of letters on keys 2 and 3 multiply to get number of letters on key 5, but that doesn't hold because phone keypad: key 2 has 3 letters, key 3 has 3 letters, product 9, not equal to letters on 5 which is 3. \nMaybe k11 equals k8\u00d712 -5 means something like if you multiply number of letters on key 8 by the index and subtract 5, you get a particular count.\n\nI realize I'm stuck without context. Possibly the intended answer: \nf(2) = ?,\nf(3)=?,\nf(4)=? etc.\nMaybe the only ones we can determine exactly are f(7) = 10 (from k7=76 gives quotient 10), f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and for k12, since division doesn't give an integer, maybe f(12) is defined by solving the equation with the given expression k12 = k8\u00d712 -5. Then f(12) would be (k8\u00d712 - 5)/12 = (224*12-5)/12 = (2688-5)/12 = 2683/12 which is not an integer.\n\nSo maybe answer: \nf(7) = 10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and f(12) = 223.583... but that's messy.\nMaybe the intended pattern only holds for keys where k_n = f(n)*n exactly.\n\nThen answer: f(n)=k_n/n when n is in {8, 11}. For others, there's no neat formula.\n\nI might re-read the problem statement: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\" It might be from a puzzle where keys are given and one must find the function f that maps index to some number. The examples provided: \nFor n=7, 76 = ?*7 + ?.\nMaybe we can solve for f(7) if we assume g is constant? For instance, maybe g(n)=n-1? Then k7 would equal f(7)*7 + (7-1)=f(7)*7+6; equate to 76 gives f(7)=70/7=10.\nFor n=8: then g(8)=? If we assume g(n) = n-? maybe 0 works for n=8 if 7? But k8=224, so if g(8)=? Let\u2019s try g(n)=n-1 again: Then f(8)= (224 - 7)/8 =217/8=27.125, not integer.\nMaybe g(n) equals something like the previous key's remainder.\n\nWait, maybe there is a pattern in the remainders: for n=7, remainder=6; for n=9, remainder=467-9*51=467-459=8; for n=12, remainder=2683 - 12*223=2683-2676=7.\nNow these remainders are: 6,8,7. They might correspond to the index of another key? For instance, 6 is k2 maybe? 8 is k? 7 is k7?\nCheck: 6 could be related to key 2 which might have value something; 8 is self; 7 is again.\n\nMaybe g(n) = k_n mod n gives a pattern that cycles through some keys. For example, g(7)=6, g(9)=8, g(12)=7.\nAnd then f(n) would be (k_n - g(n))/n. So \nf(7) = (76-6)/7=70/7=10,\nf(9) = (467-8)/9=459/9=51,\nf(11) = (1155-0)/11=105, but then g(11)=0? That doesn't match the pattern because why would remainder be 0 sometimes?\nFor n=8: f(8)=(224-0)/8=28, so maybe g(8)=0.\nSo it seems for some indices, k_n is divisible by n exactly (if remainder = 0). And for others, there's a nonzero remainder. The remainders don't seem to follow an obvious pattern with n itself.\n\nMaybe the answer expected: \"Yes, we can express k_n as f(n)*n + g(n) where f(n)=\u230ak_n/n\u230b and g(n)=k_n mod n. For example, for key 7, f(7)=10 and g(7)=6; for key 8, f(8)=28 and g(8)=0; for key 9, f(9)=51 and g(9)=8; for key 11, f(11)=105 and g(11)=0; and for key 12, f(12)=223 and g(12)=7.\"\n\nBut wait, 2683/12 is not an integer so floor would be 223 remainder 7.\n\nSo the answer might be:\nKey 7: f(7) = 10\nKey 8: f(8) = 28\nKey 9: f(9) = 51\nKey 11: f(11) = 105\nKey 12: f(12) = 223 (if floor division is intended, though it's not exact)\n\nBut I'm not convinced. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is supposed to be something like f(n)= (n+1)!/something.\n\nLet me re-read original text: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly the keys refer to specific values given in a puzzle. The provided expressions:\nk2 = ?\nk3 = ?\nk5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\nk7 = 76\nk8 = 224\nk9 = 467\nk11 = 1155\nk12 = k8\u00d712 - 5 = 2683\n\nMaybe there is a table: n, key value, f(n) maybe equals something like:\nn   k_n   f(n)\n2   ?     ?\n3   ?     ?\n4   ?     ?\n5   ? (product of k2 and k3) so f(5)=?\n7   76    =? \n8   224   =\n9   467   =\n11 1155   =\n12 2683   =\n\nMaybe the pattern is: for composite numbers, k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), where g(n) equals something like (previous key's f value)? For instance, for n=7, maybe f(7)=10; for n=8, f(8)=28; for n=9, f(9)=51; for n=11, f(11)=105.\nMaybe the pattern is that f(n) increments in some sequence: 10, 28, 51, 105,... Differences: 18, 23, 54. Not a clear linear progression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the puzzle is from a known series \"Keys\" problem where keys represent parts of a telephone number, and f(n) represents digits from a license plate or something. Without further context, I must assume that the intended answer is simply to extract f(n) by performing the division k_n/n (if divisible) or floor division otherwise.\n\nThus:\nFor key 7: f(7)=76/7? But 76/7 is not an integer. However maybe they meant \"Calculate f(n)\" meaning determine the multiplier when you express k_n in the form f(n)*n + g(n). For n=7, if we write 76 = 10*7 + 6, then f(7)=10.\nFor key 8: 224 = 28*8 + 0, so f(8)=28.\nFor key 9: 467 = 51*9 + 8, so f(9)=51.\nFor key 11: 1155 = 105*11 + 0, so f(11)=105.\nFor key 12: 2683 = 223*12 + 7, so f(12)=223.\n\nWhat about keys 2, 3, and 4? They are not given explicitly. k5 is defined as product of k2 and k3, but we don't know them.\n\nMaybe the answer expected: \nf(2) = ?,\nf(3) = ?,\nf(5) = (k2*k3)/5 if divisible,\nf(7)=10,\nf(8)=28,\nf(9)=51,\nf(11)=105,\nf(12)=223.\n\nI might say: \"We can express each key as k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), where f(n) is obtained by dividing k_n by n (taking the quotient when possible). Thus, we find:\nFor key 7: f(7)=10, since 76 = 10\u00d77 + 6.\nFor key 8: f(8)=28, as 224 = 28\u00d78 + 0.\nFor key 9: f(9)=51, because 467 = 51\u00d79 + 8.\nFor key 11: f(11)=105, since 1155 = 105\u00d711 + 0.\nFor key 12: f(12)=223, as 2683 = 223\u00d712 + 7.\nThis suggests that while many keys are divisible by their index yielding an integer f(n), others have a nonzero remainder.\"\n\nThat is likely the answer.\n\nI will now produce final answer with explanation.</think>We will show that in several cases the \u201ckey\u2010number\u201d k\u2099 can be written in the form\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n) \u00b7 n + g(n).\n\nIn other words, if you divide k\u2099 by n you obtain a quotient f(n) and (possibly) a remainder g(n). (Of course, one must have 0 \u2264 g(n) < n.) For example, look at the key numbers given below.
