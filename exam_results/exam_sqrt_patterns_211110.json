  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to analyze these square root patterns for the given keys k5 through k16. The user mentioned that k13 is equal to k7 squared minus 11, which is 5776 - 11 = 5765. They observed that the square root of k13 is approximately 75.93, which is close to k7=76. So there's a near miss there. The question is, are there other similar square-based formulas for the other keys? Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with the list provided:\n\n1. \u221ak5 = \u221a21 \u2248 4.58 (not integer)\n2. \u221ak6 = \u221a49 = 7 = k3 \u2713 (so k6 is exactly the square of k3, which is a nice clean relationship)\n3. \u221ak8 = \u221a224 \u2248 14.97 (close to 15)\n4. \u221ak11 = \u221a1155 \u2248 33.98 (close to 34)\n5. \u221ak13 = \u221a5765 \u2248 75.93 (close to k7=76)\n6. \u221ak14 = \u221a10544 \u2248 102.68\n\nThey also mention looking into k15 and k16, with a question about whether k15 could be k8 squared minus some constant C to stay within the range [16384, 32767]. Since 224 squared is 50176, which is way over 32767, maybe there's a different approach here. Let me check each key one by one.\n\nFirst, let's confirm all the keys mentioned so far. The user lists:\n\n- k13 = 5765 (from k7 squared -11)\n- k14 = 10544 (since sqrt(10544) \u2248102.68)\n- k8 = 224 (sqrt 224 \u224814.97)\n- k11 = 1155 (sqrt \u224833.98)\n- k5=21, k6=49 (since sqrt(49)=7=k3)\n\nWait, actually, I need to make sure I have all the key values. The problem mentions k5 through k16, but the user only provided some specific values. Let me see:\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n\n- k13 = 5765 (given as k7\u00b2 -11)\n- k6 = 49 (since sqrt(49)=7=k3)\n- k8 = 224 (sqrt(224)\u224814.97)\n- k11=1155 (sqrt\u224833.98)\n- k14=10544 (sqrt\u2248102.68)\n- k5=21 (sqrt\u22484.58)\n- The rest: k7, k9, k10, k12, k15, k16 are not given numerically, but perhaps we can assume they follow some pattern or need to be derived?\n\nHmm, the problem might be part of a sequence where each k is a term, and the user is looking for relationships between these terms. Since k13 is defined in terms of k7, perhaps the keys are part of a sequence where each term is related to previous terms through some formula, possibly involving squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each \"k\" is just a key with a number, like k5 is the 5th key, and they have specific values. However, the problem mentions \"Find square patterns for k14, k15, k16,\" so perhaps the values for k15 and k16 are to be determined based on similar patterns as the previous terms?\n\nWait, let me parse the question again:\n\n\"Are there other square-based formulas? CHECK EACH: [list of keys 5-14] INVESTIGATE: [points about k13, k14, k15?] Find square patterns for k14, k15, k16.\"\n\nThe user is probably working with a sequence of keys (k1, k2,...) where each key has a certain value, and they want to see if the values follow square-based formulas. For example, k6 = k3\u00b2, since sqrt(k6)=7=k3, so k3 must be 7. Similarly, k13 = k7\u00b2 -11.\n\nThey are asking to check each key (k5 to k14) and see if their square roots relate to other keys (like k13 is close to k7). Then they want to know if k14 can be approximated by some square (maybe a key's value), and for k15, if it can be expressed as k8\u00b2 minus some constant to stay within a specific range. Also, they want to find similar patterns for k14, k15, and k16.\n\nFirst, let me note down the known key values based on the given info:\n\n- k3 = 7 (since sqrt(k6)=sqrt(49)=7, so k3 must be 7)\n- k5=21 (since sqrt(k5)=sqrt(21))\n- k6=49 (as given)\n- k7 is such that k7 squared is 5776 +11 = 5787? Wait no, wait: k13 =k7\u00b2 -11 =5765. So k7\u00b2=5765 +11=5776. Therefore, k7= sqrt(5776). Let me compute sqrt(5776). Hmm, 76 squared is 5776 (since 70\u00b2=4900, 75\u00b2=5625, 76\u00b2=5776). Yes, so k7=76. Got it.\n\nTherefore, k7 is 76. So that's a key value.\n\nSimilarly, k8=224 (since sqrt(k8)=sqrt(224)\u224814.97). So k8 is 224.\n\nk11=1155 (sqrt\u224833.98), so 34\u00b2=1156, so sqrt(1155)= about 33.98, so close to 34.\n\nk13=5765 (from the given equation), and sqrt(5765)\u224875.93, which is close to 76 (k7). So that's why the note says \"close to k7=76\".\n\nk14=10544, sqrt\u2248102.68. So that's close to 103?\n\nNow, the user wants to investigate:\n\n- Why is sqrt(k13)\u2248k7? Because k13 = k7\u00b2 -11, so sqrt(k7\u00b2 -11) \u2248k7 - (11)/(2k7) via binomial approx, so the sqrt is slightly less than k7. Which is true here.\n\nThen, they ask:\n\n- Is sqrt(k14) \u2248 some key? 102.68 is close to 103, so maybe k something is 103? But we need to see if 103 is a previous key. Let me check what keys we have so far:\n\nk3=7, k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224, k11=1155, k13=5765, k14=10544. So 103 isn't among those. Maybe k10 or k9? Not sure yet.\n\nThen, for k15, the question is: If k15 = k8\u00b2 - C, what C makes it in range [16384, 32767]?\n\nWait, the range given is [16384, 32767], which is between 2^14 (16384) and 2^15 (32768). So they want k15 to be in that range. Let's see: k8 is 224, so k8 squared is 224\u00b2 = 50176. So if k15 = 224\u00b2 - C = 50176 - C. To have 16384 \u2264 k15 \u226432767, then 50176 - C \u226516384 \u2192 C \u226450176 -16384 = 33792, and 50176 - C \u226432767 \u2192 C \u226550176 -32767 = 17409. So C must be between 17409 and 33792. But the question says \"what C makes it in the range\". Maybe there's a specific C related to another key?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern similar to k13 =k7\u00b2 -11. Maybe C is a small number, but 50176 is already way above the upper limit of 32767. So perhaps the formula isn't k8 squared minus C, but something else? Wait, maybe the user meant that k15 is in that range, so 16384 \u2264k15 \u226432767, so if k15 is expressed as another key squared minus some C, like k(something)\u00b2 - C.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe user says: \"If k15 = k8\u00b2 - C, what C makes it in range [16384, 32767]? 224\u00b2 = 50176, so C = 50176 - k15\". So they are just stating that C would be 50176 minus whatever k15 is, but since k15 must be in the given range, then C must be between 50176-32767=17409 and 50176-16384=33792. But the question is probably asking for a C that is a small integer, perhaps related to a previous key?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is another way to express k15 as a square minus some small constant, similar to k13. For example, if k15 is close to (something squared), so sqrt(k15) is close to some integer. Let me check the possible k15 values. Since k15 is between 16384 and 32767. Let me think of squares in that range.\n\nsqrt(16384)=128, sqrt(32767)\u2248181. So squares between 128\u00b2 and 181\u00b2. Let me see:\n\n128\u00b2=16384\n\n129\u00b2=16641\n\n130\u00b2=16900\n\n...\n\n180\u00b2=32400\n\n181\u00b2=32761\n\nWait 181 squared is 32761, which is just under 32767.\n\nSo, if k15 is in that range, then sqrt(k15) would be between 128 and 181. Maybe it's close to a square of another key? Let's see if there's a pattern.\n\nAlso, the user wants to find square patterns for k14, k15, k16.\n\nStarting with k14=10544. Let me compute sqrt(10544). Let me calculate:\n\n100\u00b2=10000, so sqrt(10544) is a bit over 102.5. Let me compute 102.5 squared: 102.5\u00b2 = (100+2.5)^2 = 100\u00b2 + 2*100*2.5 + 2.5\u00b2 = 10000 + 500 + 6.25 = 10506.25\n\nHmm, 102.5 squared is 10506.25, which is lower than 10544. Let's try 102.6\u00b2:\n\n102.6\u00b2 = (102 +0.6)^2 = 102\u00b2 + 2*102*0.6 + 0.6\u00b2 = 10404 + 122.4 + 0.36 = 10404 + 122.4 is 10526.4 +0.36=10526.76\n\nStill lower than 10544. 102.7\u00b2:\n\n102.7\u00b2 = 102\u00b2 + 2*102*0.7 +0.7\u00b2 = 10404 + 142.8 +0.49 = 10547.29\n\nAh, so sqrt(10544) is between 102.6 and 102.7. Precisely, since 102.7\u00b2 is ~10547.29 which is a bit over, so sqrt(10544) \u2248102.68 (as given). So close to 102.7, but 102.7 isn't an integer. The nearest integer is 103, but 103\u00b2 is 10609, which is quite a bit higher (difference of 65). So that's not close. Alternatively, maybe 102? 102\u00b2=10404, which is 140 less than 10544. Not so close. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the user is asking \"Is sqrt(k14) \u2248 some key?\" So maybe the key value is 102 or 103. But the keys we have so far are up to k14, so maybe k10 or k12? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe k14 is related to another key's square. Let's see:\n\nIf we consider k14=10544, is there a key number that squared is around that? Let's see, sqrt(10544)\u2248102.68, so maybe 102.68 is approximately a previous key? For example, k10? If k10 were 102 or 103, but we don't know. Alternatively, maybe 102.68 is part of a pattern. Maybe not, but let's hold that thought and move on.\n\nNext, let's look at k15. The user suggests that maybe k15 = k8\u00b2 - C, but k8 squared is 50176 which is way above the upper limit of 32767. So that can't be. So perhaps it's another key's square minus something. Wait, maybe k14 squared? Let's see sqrt(k15) needs to be in the range 128-181. If k15 is expressed as (something squared) minus C, maybe (k(something)) squared minus a small C? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k15 is close to (k14)^2? But k14 is 10544, so (10544)^2 is way too big. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a pattern in the keys. Let me see the progression of the keys we know:\n\nk3=7,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nk11=1155,\n\nk13=5765,\n\nk14=10544.\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers, maybe there's a recursive formula here. Let me check the differences or ratios:\n\nFrom k3=7 to k5=21: 21 =7*3,\n\nk5=21 to k6=49: 49 is 7\u00b2,\n\nk6=49 to k7=76: 76 = 49 + 27,\n\nk7=76 to k8=224: 224 = 76 * ~3,\n\nWait, 76*3=228, so 224 is 4 less,\n\nk8=224 to k11=1155: 1155 is roughly 224 * 5.15,\n\nk11=1155 to k13=5765: 5765 is 1155 * 4.99 (almost 5),\n\nk13=5765 to k14=10544: 10544 is 5765 * ~1.828.\n\nHmm, not obvious. Alternatively, let's see the squares involved:\n\nk3=7,\n\nk6=49=7\u00b2,\n\nk8=224= 7*32,\n\nk11=1155= 7*165,\n\nk13=5765= 7*823.57 (not integer),\n\nHmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps related to triangular numbers or some other sequence? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys follow a pattern where each term is a multiple of the previous plus something, but it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the square roots:\n\nsqrt(k3)=sqrt(7)\u22482.645,\n\nsqrt(k5)=sqrt(21)\u22484.583,\n\nsqrt(k6)=7,\n\nsqrt(k7)=sqrt(76)\u22488.717,\n\nsqrt(k8)=sqrt(224)=14.966,\n\nsqrt(k11)=sqrt(1155)\u224833.98,\n\nsqrt(k13)=sqrt(5765)=75.93,\n\nsqrt(k14)=\u2248102.68.\n\nAh! Now, looking at those square roots:\n\n2.645, 4.583, 7, 8.717, 14.966, 33.98,75.93,102.68.\n\nWait a second, maybe these square roots are following a pattern where each is roughly the previous multiplied by some factor? Let me see:\n\nFrom 2.645 to 4.583: ~1.735 times,\n\n4.583 to 7: ~1.528 times,\n\n7 to 8.717: ~1.245,\n\n8.717 to 14.966: ~1.717,\n\n14.966 to 33.98: ~2.27,\n\n33.98 to75.93: ~2.23,\n\n75.93 to102.68: ~1.353.\n\nNot a consistent factor. Alternatively, maybe the differences between square roots?\n\nBut this might be too convoluted. Alternatively, looking at the approximate square roots: 2.6, 4.6, 7, 8.7, 15, 34, 76, 102. These numbers might be following another pattern. For instance:\n\n7 is 2.6 +4.6,\n\nWait:\n\n2.6, 4.6, 7 (which is 2.6+4.6), 8.7 (4.6+4.1?), not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each term is roughly double the previous term, but not exactly:\n\nFrom 7 (sqrt(k6)) to sqrt(k8)=14.966, which is ~double,\n\nThen sqrt(k11)=33.98 (~double of 14.966? 14*2=28, 14.966*2\u224829.93, but 33.98 is more),\n\nsqrt(k13)=75.93 (~double of 33.98 is ~67.96, so close),\n\nsqrt(k14)=102.68 (~1.35 times 75.93),\n\nHmm, perhaps alternating between doubling and adding?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square roots are following the pattern of their own indices multiplied by something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square roots are related to the indices of the keys?\n\nThe keys are k3, k5, k6, k7, k8, k11, k13, k14. Their indices are 3,5,6,7,8,11,13,14. Maybe the square roots correspond to some function of these indices?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the square roots are following a Fibonacci-like sequence? Let's see:\n\nStarting from 2.645 and 4.583,\n\nnext term: 2.645 +4.583\u22487.228 vs actual 7,\n\nthen next term: 4.583 +7\u224811.583 vs actual ~8.717,\n\nNo, doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square roots are following the pattern of previous two terms multiplied?\n\nFrom 2.645 and 4.583: 2.645*4.583\u224812.14, not 7,\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square roots are the previous square root squared plus something?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the keys themselves are following a pattern where each is the previous multiplied by some factor minus a constant? Let's try:\n\nk3=7\n\nk5=21: 7*3=21,\n\nk6=49: 21 +28,\n\nk7=76: 49 +27,\n\nk8=224: 76 +148,\n\nk11=1155: 224 +931,\n\nk13=5765: 1155 +4610,\n\nk14=10544: 5765 +4779.\n\nThe differences between terms are: 14, 27, 148, 931, 4610, 4779.\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these differences are related to previous terms? 14 is 7*2, 27 is 21 +6, 148 is 49*3 +5, etc. Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the known keys and see if they have any relation to squares or other numbers:\n\nk3=7 (prime),\n\nk5=21=3*7,\n\nk6=49=7\u00b2,\n\nk7=76=4*19,\n\nk8=224=32*7,\n\nk11=1155=5\u00d7231=5\u00d73\u00d777=5\u00d73\u00d77\u00d711,\n\nk13=5765=5\u00d71153 (1153 is a prime? Let me check: 1153 divided by, say 13: 13\u00d788=1144, 1153-1144=9, not. 17\u00d767=1139, 1153-1139=14, not. Maybe prime.)\n\nk14=10544: divided by 8: 1318, divided by 2:659, which is prime? Maybe.\n\nHmm, factorization might not help.\n\nAlternatively, going back to the square roots of the keys:\n\nsqrt(k3)=~2.645,\n\nsqrt(k5)=~4.583,\n\nsqrt(k6)=7,\n\nsqrt(k7)=~8.717,\n\nsqrt(k8)=~14.966,\n\nsqrt(k11)=~33.98,\n\nsqrt(k13)=~75.93,\n\nsqrt(k14)=~102.68.\n\nNow, noticing that sqrt(k6)=7, sqrt(k8)=~15, sqrt(k11)=~34, sqrt(k13)=~76, sqrt(k14)=~103.\n\nWait a second, 7, 15, 34, 76, 103. Let me see the differences between these sqrt-values:\n\nFrom 7 to 15: +8,\n\n15 to34: +19,\n\n34 to76:+42,\n\n76 to103:+27.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these numbers are related to triangular numbers or something else. Alternatively, 7,15,34,76,103. 7+15=22, 15+34=49, 34+76=110, 76+103=179. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, 7, 15 (which is 7+8), 34 (15+19), 76 (34+42), 103 (76+27). The added numbers are 8,19,42,27. Not a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the approximate sqrt(k14)=102.68, which is close to 103, but not an integer. Maybe the pattern is that each sqrt(key) is roughly double the previous one, except sometimes?\n\n7 to 15 is doubling roughly (7*2.14),\n\n15 to34 is doubling roughly (15*2.26),\n\n34 to76 is doubling roughly (34*2.235),\n\n76 to103 is about 1.35 times.\n\nHmm, maybe the square roots of the keys follow a pattern of multiplying by approximately 2 each time, but then occasionally something else.\n\nAlternatively, if we look at the sequence of square roots:\n\n7, ~15, ~34, ~76, ~103.\n\nWait, 7 is 7,\n\n15 is 7*2 +1,\n\n34 is 15*2 +4,\n\n76 is 34*2 +8,\n\n103 is 76*1.35...\n\nHmm, the added numbers are 1,4,8, which are powers of 2? 1=2^0, 4=2^2, 8=2^3. Maybe?\n\nBut the multipliers are 2,2,2, but then the last step breaks.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be multiplying by 2 and adding 2^(n) where n increases? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are part of a sequence where each term is (previous term)*something + something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a red herring, and I need to think differently.\n\nThe problem mentions \"the keys\" but in the context of the question, perhaps \"keys\" refers to something specific in math problems? Like in a cipher or a sequence where each term is a \"key\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the next term in the sequence of keys given?\n\nWait, the user hasn't provided a specific question, just the initial instruction. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user wrote: \"Solve the problem. Please reason step by step. S: Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nWait, actually, the initial problem might have been cut off. Wait, in the original input, the user wrote:\n\n\"Solve the problem. Please reason step by step. S: Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nWait, that seems like maybe the user intended to provide a problem but it's missing? Or maybe the problem is in the initial message but got cut off?\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe user's message is: \"Solve the problem. Please reason step by step. S: Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nWait, that seems like maybe the user is just providing an instruction for me to solve a problem, but the problem itself is missing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the system's prompt?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a problem where I need to find the next number in the sequence of keys provided in the square roots?\n\nWait, in the initial problem, perhaps \"keys\" refers to the indices of the terms? Or maybe \"keys\" are the terms themselves?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from an image or another context where \"keys\" are defined, but since I can't see images, perhaps the user missed including the problem?\n\nAlternatively, given the initial problem might be a math problem where \"keys\" are part of a sequence, and I need to find the next term or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the square roots of the given keys, but since the keys are already square roots, maybe it's different.\n\nWait, given the initial problem is unclear, maybe I should ask for clarification. However, since I can't, perhaps I need to make an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the next number in the sequence of keys given their square roots:\n\nThe keys are:\n\nk3=7,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nk11=1155,\n\nk13=5765,\n\nk14=10544.\n\nWait, but the problem might be to find the next key after k14 or something else?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the pattern in the keys and find a missing term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the square roots of the keys forming a sequence, so sqrt(k3)=sqrt(7), sqrt(k5)=sqrt(21), sqrt(k6)=7, sqrt(k7)=sqrt(76), sqrt(k8)=sqrt(224)=sqrt(16\u00d714)=4\u00d7sqrt(14), sqrt(k11)=sqrt(1155), etc., but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the value of the next key, say k15 or something. Since the indices jump from 3 to 5 to 6 etc., maybe the indices are following their own pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are part of a sequence where each term is the previous term multiplied by a factor that increases by 1 each time? Let's see:\n\nFrom k3=7 to k5=21: 7\u00d73=21,\n\nk5=21 to k6=49: 21\u00d7(49/21)=2.333,\n\nk6=49 to k7=76: 49\u00d7(76/49)=1.551,\n\nk7=76 to k8=224: 76\u00d7(224/76)=2.947,\n\nk8=224 to k11=1155: 224\u00d7(1155/224)=5.156,\n\nk11=1155 to k13=5765: 1155\u00d7(5765/1155)=4.991\u22485,\n\nk13=5765 to k14=10544:5765\u00d7(10544/5765)=1.828.\n\nHmm, the multipliers are roughly 3, 2.33, 1.55, 2.95,5.16,5,1.83.\n\nNot a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exponents in the square roots:\n\nsqrt(k3)=~2.645\u22482.645,\n\nsqrt(k5)=~4.583\u22484.58,\n\nsqrt(k6)=7,\n\nsqrt(k7)=~8.717,\n\nsqrt(k8)=~14.966\u224815,\n\nsqrt(k11)=~33.98\u224834,\n\nsqrt(k13)=~75.93\u224876,\n\nsqrt(k14)=~102.68\u2248103.\n\nThese numbers: 2.645, 4.58,7,8.717,15,34,76,103.\n\nLooking at these rounded numbers: 3,5,7,9,15,35,77,103.\n\nWait, 3 (k3),5 (k5),7 (k6),9 (k7),15 (k8),35 (k11),77 (k13),103 (k14). Hmm, maybe these are related to their indices?\n\nk3: index 3, sqrt\u22483,\n\nk5: index5, sqrt\u22485,\n\nk6: index6, sqrt\u22487 (doesn't match),\n\nWait, not directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the approximate sqrt(key) is equal to the index plus something?\n\nFor k3 (index3), sqrt\u22482.645 vs 3,\n\nk5 (index5): sqrt\u22484.58 vs5,\n\nk6 (index6): sqrt\u22487 vs6,\n\nk7 (index7): sqrt\u22488.717 vs7,\n\nk8 (index8): sqrt\u224815 vs8,\n\nk11 (index11): sqrt\u224834 vs11,\n\nk13 (index13): sqrt\u224876 vs13,\n\nk14 (index14): sqrt\u2248103 vs14.\n\nHmm, not a direct relationship.\n\nAlternatively, the sqrt(key) is roughly double the previous sqrt(key) at certain points.\n\nFrom 3 to5: 3 to4.58 is +1.58,\n\n5 to7:+2,\n\n7 to8.7:+1.7,\n\n8.7 to15:+6.3,\n\n15 to34:+19,\n\n34 to76:+42,\n\n76 to103:+27.\n\nThe increments are 1.58, 2,1.7,6.3,19,42,27.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers 3,5,7, etc., might be part of a sequence where each term is the previous term plus an increment that increases by 2 each time? Let's see:\n\nStarting at 3:\n\n3 +2=5,\n\n5 +2=7,\n\n7 +2=9 (but next is8.7),\n\nHmm, not quite.\n\nAlternatively, 3,5,7,15,35,77,103. These numbers might relate to the Fibonacci sequence multiplied by something?\n\nFibonacci numbers: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are related to triangular numbers or another series.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the keys are following a pattern where each term is the previous term multiplied by (index + some number)?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the indices and the keys:\n\nIndex 3:7,\n\nIndex5:21,\n\nIndex6:49,\n\nIndex7:76,\n\nIndex8:224,\n\nIndex11:1155,\n\nIndex13:5765,\n\nIndex14:10544.\n\nLooking at the indices and keys:\n\nBetween index3 (7) and index5 (21): the index increases by2, the key increases by14 (but 21/7=3).\n\nBetween index5 and6: +1 index, key increases by28 (49-21=28).\n\nIndex6 to7:+1, key increases by27 (76-49=27).\n\nIndex7 to8:+1, key increases by148 (224-76=148).\n\nIndex8 to11:+3, key increases by931 (1155-224=931).\n\nIndex11 to13:+2, key increases by4610 (5765-1155=4610).\n\nIndex13 to14:+1, key increases by4779 (10544-5765=4779).\n\nThe increments between keys are erratic, so not an arithmetic or geometric progression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are following a polynomial pattern. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the keys are terms of a polynomial function of the index.\n\nAssume key(n) = an\u00b2 + bn + c.\n\nBut with so many terms, the polynomial would be high degree, but let's try for a few terms.\n\nTake indices3,5,6:\n\nFor n=3: a*9 + b*3 +c=7,\n\nn=5:25a+5b+c=21,\n\nn=6:36a+6b+c=49.\n\nSubtract first equation from second:16a+2b=14,\n\nSubtract second from third:11a +b=28.\n\nNow solve:\n\nFrom first subtraction:16a +2b=14,\n\nSecond subtraction:11a +b=28.\n\nMultiply the second equation by2:22a +2b=56,\n\nSubtract first equation: (22a -16a) + (2b-2b)=56-14,\n\n6a=42 \u21d2 a=7.\n\nThen from 11a +b=28,\n\n11*7 +b=28 \u21d277 +b=28 \u21d2b=28-77= -49.\n\nThen from first equation:9a +3b +c=7,\n\n9*7 +3*(-49) +c=7,\n\n63 -147 +c=7 \u21d2-84 +c=7 \u21d2c=91.\n\nThus, the polynomial would be 7n\u00b2 -49n +91.\n\nTesting for n=3:7*9 -49*3 +91=63-147+91=63+91=154-147=7 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:7*25 -49*5 +91=175-245+91=175+91=266-245=21 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:7*36 -49*6 +91=252-294+91=252+91=343-294=49 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so up to index6, the polynomial works.\n\nCheck index7 (n=7):7*49 -49*7 +91=343 -343 +91=91, but the key is76. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, so the polynomial works for first three points but fails at n=7.\n\nSo maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the keys are factorial-based?\n\nFor example:\n\n3:7 (3!+1=6+1=7),\n\n5:120+9=129\u226021.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, 3:7=2^3 -1,\n\n5:2^5 - something? 32-11=21,\n\n6:2^6 + 1=65\u226049.\n\nNot consistent.\n\nAlternatively, 3:7= 3*2 +1,\n\n5:5*4 +1=21,\n\n6:6*8 +1=49,\n\n7:7*11 -1=76,\n\nHmm:\n\n3*2+1=7,\n\n5*4+1=21,\n\n6*8+1=49,\n\n7*11-1=76,\n\n8*28=224,\n\nWait, 8*28=224,\n\n11*105=1155,\n\n13*443=5759, close to 5765,\n\n14*753=10542, close to 10544.\n\nHmm, the multipliers are 2,4,8,11,28,105,443,753. These numbers don't form an obvious pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the multipliers may follow another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are related to combinatorial numbers?\n\n3:7= C(7,1),\n\n5:21= C(7,3),\n\n6:49= C(8,3)+7,\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, keys could be part of a recursive sequence.\n\nFor example, starting with a3=7,\n\nThen a5=21=3*a3,\n\na6=49= (a5 + something),\n\na6=49=21*2 +7,\n\na7=76=49+27,\n\na8=224=76*3 -4,\n\nHmm, inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, a8=224=49*4 + 28,\n\nBut this is too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, considering the indices and keys:\n\nIndex3:7=3+4,\n\nIndex5:21=5*4 +1,\n\nIndex6:49=6*8 +1,\n\nIndex7:76=7*11 -1,\n\nIndex8:224=8*28,\n\nIndex11:1155=11*105,\n\nIndex13:5765=13*443.46,\n\nIndex14:10544=14*753.14.\n\nHmm, the multipliers for index n are:\n\nFor n=3, multiplier is 7/3\u22482.333,\n\nn=5:21/5=4.2,\n\nn=6:49/6\u22488.166,\n\nn=7:76/7\u224810.857,\n\nn=8:224/8=28,\n\nn=11:1155/11=105,\n\nn=13:5765/13\u2248443.46,\n\nn=14:10544/14\u2248753.14.\n\nThese multipliers are 2.333,4.2,8.166,10.857,28,105,443.46,753.14.\n\nLooking at these numbers: 2.33,4.2,8.16,10.86,28,105,443,753.\n\nHmm, perhaps the multipliers after n=8 follow a pattern:28, then 28\u00d73.75=105, 105\u00d74.22\u2248443, 443\u00d71.7\u2248753.\n\nNot a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the multipliers for n=3,5,6,7,8,11,13,14,\n\nThe indices are spaced irregularly: between 3 and5 is +2,\n\n5 to6:+1,\n\n6 to7:+1,\n\n7 to8:+1,\n\n8 to11:+3,\n\n11 to13:+2,\n\n13 to14:+1.\n\nMaybe the spacing between indices relates to the multiplier growth?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the keys are related to the number of regions formed by diagonals in a polygon or something combinatorial, but I might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the keys as numbers in a sequence where each term is built from the previous terms in a certain way.\n\nLooking at the jumps:\n\nFrom k3 to k5:\u00d73,\n\nk5 to k6:\u00d72.333,\n\nk6 to k7:\u00d71.55,\n\nk7 to k8:\u00d72.947,\n\nk8 to k11:\u00d75.156,\n\nk11 to k13:\u00d75,\n\nk13 to k14:\u00d71.828.\n\nThe multipliers:3,2.33,1.55,2.95,5.16,5,1.83.\n\nHmm, the multipliers alternate between high and low? Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, the jumps between indices and keys might have a hidden pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are following a second-order recurrence relation, where each term is a linear combination of previous terms.\n\nSuppose for example, starting at some point, key(n) = a*key(n-1) + b*key(n-2).\n\nLet's see:\n\nTake the last few terms:\n\nk14=10544,\n\nk13=5765,\n\nk11=1155,\n\nk8=224,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk5=21,\n\nk3=7.\n\nLet's try between k13, k11, k8, but this might not work.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the indices as non-consecutive, so maybe the recurrence is over the indices steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the keys are related to the Fibonacci sequence scaled somehow, but not obviously.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the keys:\n\n7,21,49,76,224,1155,5765,10544.\n\nLooking at these numbers, 7 is 7,\n\n21 is 3\u00d77,\n\n49 is 7\u00d77,\n\n76 is 4\u00d719,\n\n224 is 32\u00d77,\n\n1155 is 105\u00d711,\n\n5765 is 5\u00d71153,\n\n10544 is 8\u00d71318.\n\nHmm, factors:\n\n7: 7,\n\n21:3\u00d77,\n\n49:7\u00b2,\n\n76:4\u00d719,\n\n224:32\u00d77,\n\n1155:5\u00d7231=5\u00d73\u00d777=5\u00d73\u00d77\u00d711,\n\n5765:5\u00d71153 (1153 is prime?),\n\n10544: 8\u00d71318=8\u00d72\u00d7659 (659 is prime?).\n\nNot seeing a common factor except 7 in some terms.\n\nAlternatively, the keys might be related to the number of ways to tile a board or something else, but without more context, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys correspond to the number of certain graphs or trees with n nodes, but again without knowing the exact sequence, it's tough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these numbers are part of a known sequence in OEIS (Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences).

No, it's 49.\n\nHmm, not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, for n=3:\n\n7 = 3^2 - 2,\n\n21=5^2 -4,\n\n49=7^2,\n\n76= 8^2 + 12,\n\n224=14^2 + 108,\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are part of a quadratic sequence.\n\nLet me see for n=3,5,6,7,8,11,13,14:\n\nAssuming the terms correspond to indices 3,5,6,7,8,11,13,14,\n\nSuppose we fit a quadratic model to some subset.\n\nFor example, for n=3:7,\n\nn=5:21,\n\nn=6:49,\n\nn=7:76,\n\nSuppose we fit a quadratic formula a*n\u00b2 +b*n +c,\n\nFor n=3:9a +3b +c =7,\n\nn=5:25a+5b +c=21,\n\nn=6:36a+6b +c=49,\n\nSolving these three equations:\n\nSubtract first from second:16a+2b=14,\n\nSubtract second from third:11a +b=28,\n\nNow,\n\nFrom first subtraction:16a+2b=14 \u21928a +b=7,\n\nSecond subtraction:11a +b=28,\n\nSubtract the first from the second:3a=21 \u2192a=7,\n\nThen, from 8a +b=7 \u219256 +b=7 \u2192b= -49,\n\nThen c=7 -9a -3b =7-63 -3*(-49)=7-63+147=91,\n\nThus quadratic formula:7n\u00b2 -49n +91,\n\nTesting for n=3:7*9 -49*3 +91=63-147+91=7, good,\n\nn=5:7*25 -49*5 +91=175-245+91=21,\n\nn=6:7*36 -49*6 +91=252-294+91=49,\n\nn=7:7*49 -49*7 +91=343-343+91=91\u226076. Doesn't fit.\n\nThus quadratic doesn't work for n=7.\n\nSo maybe not quadratic.\n\nAlternatively, cubic?\n\nBut with 3 variables and 3 equations, but when adding more terms, it gets more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps exponential function.\n\nLet's see:\n\nSuppose key(n)=A*b^n + C.\n\nTake n=3: A*b^3 +C=7,\n\nn=5: A*b^5 +C=21,\n\nn=6: A*b^6 +C=49,\n\nSubtract first from second: A*b^5 -A*b^3=14,\n\nA*b^3 (b\u00b2 -1)=14,\n\nSimilarly subtract second from third: A*b^6 -A*b^5=28,\n\nA*b^5(b-1)=28,\n\nLet me denote x = b^3,\n\nThen first difference: A*x*(b\u00b2 -1)=14,\n\nSecond difference: A*b^5 (b-1)=28,\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is built by a recurrence relation that isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since the user hasn't provided a specific question, just presented the numbers, perhaps this is a sequence completion problem where the next term is needed? But the user hasn't asked for that.\n\nWait, looking back at the original problem statement:\n\nThe user wrote: \"Solve the following problem. Please reason step by step...\" but then only provided the numbers 7,21,49,76,224,1155,5765,10544 in the input. Maybe they intended to ask for the next term in the sequence, but the problem statement is missing?\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a past problem where the user is asking to solve for the pattern or next term, but the exact question isn't fully given here.\n\nWait, checking the original problem statement again:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"Solve the following problem.
