The given keys with numbers? Provided in message:\n- \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" though note text says \"indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no\"\n- \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\"\n- Check: \n   For k7: ? \u00d7 7 + ? gives 76/7 \u2248 10.86 (not integer)\n   For k8: ? \u00d7 8 + ? equals exactly 224/8=28, so f(8)=28? Actually they say \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" then 224/8=28 means that when we divide k8 by its index 8, the quotient is an integer. Possibly f(8) equals 28.\n   For k9: 467/9 \u224851.89 not integer,\n   For k11: 1155/11 =105 exactly, so f(11)=105? Actually they write \"k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\"\n   For k12: 2683/12 \u2248223.58 but then note that k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nThey say \"So k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\nIt says \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So we have to analyze the pattern.\n\nObserving: We are given some keys: k2, k3, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. They appear in formulas: \n- \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" means perhaps that k5 is equal to the product of keys at indices 2 and 3. So maybe k5 = k2 * k3? But they mention that index 5 appears in formula but not sure.\n\nWait, details:\nObservations lines:\n\n\"OBSERVED: \n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\nIt seems that the formula \"k_n = f(n) * n + g(n)\" is proposed to see if we can find a pattern in some keys.\n\nNow, from the check: \nFor n=7, k7/7 ~ 10.86 not integer.\nFor n=8, k8/8 equals 28 exactly. So maybe f(8)=? It says \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" and they got that it is exactly equal to 224? Actually the check: \"224/8 = 28\", so we have f(8) = 28 and then g(8) must be something such that: k8 = 28\u00d78 + g(8). But since 28\u00d78=224, if k8 is exactly 224 then g(8)=0. So maybe the pattern for n=8: f(8)=28, g(8)=0.\n\nFor n=11, we got: \"1155/11 =105\", so that means 11 times something plus remainder equals 1155? Let's check: If k11 = f(11)*11 + g(11), and they computed 1155/11 = 105 exactly. That implies f(11)=105 and g(11)=0.\n\nFor n=12, we have \"2683/12 is not an integer but then note that k8\u00d712 - 5 gives 2683.\" So if we express 2683 as 28*12 - 5? Actually check: 28 * 12 =336, minus 5 equals331, no. Let's re-read: \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 =223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". Wait, they mention that k8 is 28, so maybe k8\u00d712 -5 equals 28*12 -5 equals336 -5 equals331, not 2683. There's a possibility of misinterpretation: Possibly \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" means the formula for key 12 uses k8 and index 12? Wait re-read original message:\n\n\"OBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\"\n\nThe second observation is \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\". So that might be the explicit formula for key 12: k12 = k8 * 12 - 5. And we know k8=224 from check? Wait, check: It says: \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 =28\". But then \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12=223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683.\" That is contradictory: If we compute k8 * 12 - 5 with k8=224, that equals 224*12 -5 =2688 -5=2683. So yes, the formula for key 12 is indeed: k12 = (k8)*12 - 5.\n\nSo it seems that some keys satisfy a formula of the form:\n   k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\nwhere f(8)=28 and g(8)=0, and f(11)=105 and g(11)=0, and for n=12 we have: k12 = 224*12? Wait check: Actually let me re-read the provided checks:\n\n- For key 7: k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean) so not matching any f(n)*n pattern.\n- For key 8: k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28, so that implies maybe f(8)=28 and the remainder is zero.\n- For key 9: k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n- For key 11: k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 =105, so that implies f(11)=105 and remainder zero.\n- For key 12: k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 =223.58... but we know that k8\u00d712 - 5=2683.\n\nSo the pattern appears to be: sometimes there is a formula of the form k_n = (some function f(n))*n, without an extra constant term, and sometimes it's with an additional adjustment like \"- 5\" for key 12. But question \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly they want us to find f(2), f(3), f(5), etc from the observed formulas.\n\nWe have: \nk5 = k2 * k3.\nMaybe keys are defined recursively? There is an observation: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" means that index 5 equals product of keys at indices 2 and 3. So maybe each key can be expressed in terms of previous ones?\n\nWe might guess a pattern like:\nFor prime indices, maybe f(n) is something like: if n=2 then maybe we denote k2 = ?.\nBut what are the values? Possibly the provided checks give us explicit numerical keys: \nk7 seems to equal 76, but then they check \"k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ?\" with division gives 76/7 which is 10.857... That doesn't work as integer.\n\nMaybe we should try to see if there's a pattern in the numbers provided:\n- k5 is not given numerically. But we have relation: k5 = k2 * k3.\n- k8 has value 224 (from check \"224/8=28\").\n- k11 has value 1155 (since 1155/11=105).\n- k12 has value 2683 (given from formula k8\u00d712 - 5, which equals 224*12 - 5 = 2688 - 5 = 2683).\n\nThe question: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So f(7), f(8), f(9), f(11), and maybe also f(2), f(3)? But then check the text: \"OBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\"\n\nMaybe there is a pattern where if index n is composite then maybe it's formed by product or sum of other keys.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read the problem statement carefully:\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\nIt then asks: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)?\n\nCalculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nWhat does \"for each key\" mean? Possibly we need to find f(2), f(3), f(5), etc. But not all keys are given.\n\nMaybe the sequence is something like: The keys appear in a pattern like:\nn=2: k2 = ?\nn=3: k3 = ?\nn=4: k4 = ? maybe?\nn=5: k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\nn=6: k6 = ?\n...\nn=7: k7 = 76? Because check \"k7 = ?\" but then they compute 76/7, so likely k7 is 76.\nn=8: k8 = 224 (because 224/8=28)\nn=9: k9 = 467 (because 467/9=51.89 so maybe it's not divisible by 9 exactly).\nn=10: k10 = ?\nn=11: k11 = 1155 (since 1155/11=105, an integer multiple of 11)\nn=12: k12 = 2683 (given)\n\nAlso earlier \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" but we don't know the numeric values for k2 and k3. They could be primes? Possibly k2 = 2 and k3=3? But then product is 6, not 5.\n\nMaybe keys are like: For index n, f(n) equals something computed from digits of n or some recurrence relation.\n\nObserving given integer results:\n- k8 yields quotient 28. So if we set k8 = f(8)*8 + g(8), and apparently f(8)=? But they got 224/8=28 exactly. That means remainder is 0, so maybe it's simply f(8) * 8. So f(8) equals 28.\n- k11 yields quotient 105 exactly when divided by 11: 1155/11 = 105, so f(11)=105 (with remainder zero).\n\nWhat about others?\nk7: 76/7 = 10.857... So maybe the pattern is not consistent.\n\nMaybe we need to consider each key's index:\nFor n=2,3,5, maybe they follow a similar formula? Possibly f(n) might be something like n^3 - something?\n\nLet\u2019s try to see if there's any pattern: \nk8 = 28*8. k11 = 105*11.\nMaybe we can guess the formula: For prime indices maybe f(n)= (n+?)?\nFor n=8, which is composite? But k12 uses product of k8 and then subtract 5.\n\nI note that the phrase \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN\" suggests that sometimes a key's value equals the product of keys at earlier indices or something like that. For example: k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. Similarly, maybe k6 could equal something? But we don't have more info.\nMaybe f(n) is defined for those indices where the division yields an integer quotient and then g(n)=0.\n\nWe know:\nFor n=8: f(8)=224/8=28, so that gives 28 = f(8).\nFor n=11: f(11)=1155/11=105.\nMaybe also we can compute for others if they divided evenly? The check for k7 and k9 did not yield an integer quotient. So maybe the pattern only holds for keys where index is prime or something.\n\nPerhaps there's a recurrence: For composite indices, sometimes you get addition of constant terms. \nWait, \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ?\" but then they note that using f(8) gives a near fit if we do k8\u00d712 -5.\nSo maybe g(n) is not always 0, and sometimes it's computed as: for n=12, f(n)=? such that 2683/12 is not an integer. But then the observation \"k8\u00d712-5\" equals 2683 exactly.\n\nMaybe we can try to solve: k12 = f(12)*12 + g(12). And they note that if you use f(8) (which is 28) and multiply by 12 and subtract 5, you get 2683. So perhaps for n=12, we have f(12)=? It doesn't equal 28 though because 28*12 =336, minus something. Let's solve: If k12 = 224\u00d712 - 5 then that equals 2688 - 5 = 2683. But they already computed k12 as 2683. So maybe the pattern is that for some indices, f(n) might be taken from a previous key's value (like f(12)=k8). And for others, like n=11, it's directly divisible.\n\nSo we have two cases: one case where k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) with remainder 0, so f(n) is exactly the quotient when divided by n; and another case where not.\n\nGiven that the question explicitly asks \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" I suspect they want us to determine the multiplier in these formulas. The ones we can clearly compute are:\nFor k8: f(8)=28.\nFor k11: f(11)=105.\nFor k12, if we try dividing 2683 by 12, it's not an integer: 2683/12 = 223.5833, so maybe that doesn't yield a clean multiplier. But then they note \"k8\u00d712 - 5=2683\", which means if we let f(8)=28 then 28\u00d712 gives 336, and subtracting 5 gives 331, not 2683. That doesn't match either.\n\nWait recalc: k8 is 224, so maybe the relation \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" means: take k8 (which is 224), multiply by 12 to get 2688, then subtract 5 to get 2683. So that fits.\nSo for n=12, if we consider the formula k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) and want it to match \"k8\u00d712 -5\", maybe one could express 224 as some function of n? For instance, maybe f(12)=? But then 28 is already from k8.\nI see a pattern: sometimes the multiplier in the product formula comes from an earlier key. So perhaps for composite indices like 12, you use f(n) = (some previous f?) It could be that:\nf(5) might equal something like f(2)*f(3)? But they gave k5 = k2 * k3, and if we express in the form k5 = f(5)*5 + g(5), then maybe f(5)=? Not sure.\n\nI wonder if there's more context to these keys. They might be defined by a recursive pattern like:\nk1 = 1\nk2 = 2\nk3 = 3\nand then for composite indices, k_n = (the sum of the keys corresponding to its prime factors in some way) or product.\nFor example: k5 = k2*k3 suggests that when n is a semiprime with primes 2 and 3, you multiply them. And k12 might be computed as k8 * 12 - 5, which doesn't obviously relate to factorization though.\n\nMaybe the idea is that f(n) sometimes equals (k_{prime})? \nFor example: For n=11 (which is prime), we get k11 = 1155 and f(11)=105. And 105 might be computed as something like 7*15, but not clear.\n\nI need to re-read the \"CHECK\" list:\n1) k7: 76/7 \u2260 integer.\n2) k8: 224/8 =28 (so that's neat)\n3) k9: 467/9 is not an integer.\n4) k11: 1155/11 =105, neat.\n5) k12: 2683/12 is not an integer but can be expressed as k8*12 - 5.\n\nSo it appears the pattern holds for n=8 and n=11. So maybe f(n) = (k_n)/n when division yields an integer result. That gives:\nf(8)=224/8 =28.\nf(11)=1155/11 =105.\n\nFor other indices, maybe we can compute what would be the multiplier if they did divide evenly? But for k7, it's not divisible by 7, so f(7) might be computed as floor division? Not sure.\n\nThe question \"Calculate f(n)\" likely means: express each key in the form: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), and then compute f(n). So we have:\n\nFor n=7: if we attempt to divide 76 by 7, we get 10 remainder something. Let's do division: 76 / 7 = 10 remainder 6 (because 70+6=76). So that would give f(7) = 10 and g(7)=6.\nFor n=8: as computed, 224/8 =28 exactly, so f(8)=28, g(8)=0.\nFor n=9: 467 divided by 9 gives 51 remainder something. 9*51=459, remainder 8. So f(9) would be 51 and g(9)=8.\nFor n=11: 1155/11 =105 exactly, so f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\nFor n=12: 2683 divided by 12 gives quotient floor division: 12*223=2676, remainder 7. But they also note that k12 equals k8\u00d712 - 5. That suggests a relation with the earlier key f(8) maybe?\nWait recalc: 2683/12 = 223 remainder 7 because 223*12 =2676 and 2676+7=2683.\n\nSo then we have:\nf(7)=10, g(7)=6.\nf(8)=28, g(8)=0.\nf(9)=51, g(9)=8.\nf(11)=105, g(11)=0.\nf(12)=223, g(12)=7.\n\nBut then what about k2, k3, and k5? Possibly we can compute them if we assume a pattern. We know k5 = k2 * k3. And maybe the keys for small indices are like:\nk1 might be defined as 1 (commonly),\nk2 might be something,\nk3 might be something.\n\nWe don't have explicit numbers though.\n\nMaybe the intended answer: For key n, f(n) is given by floor division of k_n by n. And then listing them gives: \nf(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and f(12)=223. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nMaybe we can check if these numbers (10, 28, 51, 105, 223) follow any pattern? They could be related to some well-known sequences:\n- 28 is a perfect number.\n- 105 appears in combinatorics.\n- 223 is prime maybe?\n\nLet's see: 10 = 2*5; 28=4^3 - something... Not sure.\n\nMaybe the answer should list:\nFor n=7, k_7 = 76 = 10*7 + 6 so f(7)=10,\nfor n=8, k_8 = 224 = 28*8 + 0 so f(8)=28,\nfor n=9, k_9 = 467 = 51*9 + 8 so f(9)=51,\nfor n=11, k_11 = 1155 = 105*11 + 0 so f(11)=105,\nfor n=12, k_12 = 2683 = 223*12 + 7 so f(12)=223.\n\nHowever, we haven't been given values for k2, k3, or k5 explicitly. But maybe they are:\nMaybe k2 is a base value like 2? Then k3 might be 3? And then k5 would equal 2*3=6. Then what is f(2)? k2/2 =? That would give f(2)=1 if k2=2.\nSimilarly, for k3, if k3=3 then f(3)=3/3=1.\nThen for k5: k5 should be 6, and 6/5 is not an integer. But the observed pattern \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" would give 6, but that doesn't fit the form k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) with a nice quotient maybe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence of keys is something like: \nFor prime indices n (like 2,3,11), maybe k_n = n^? Possibly k2=4, k3=9, then k5 would be 20? But then product equals 36 which might not equal anything.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the only keys we have numerical values for are k7, k8, k9, k11, and k12. Then answer: f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and f(12)=223.\n\nBut maybe there's a pattern to compute these values in terms of n:\nFor n=7: 76/7 gives quotient 10 remainder 6. For n=8: 224/8 gives quotient 28. For n=9: 467/9 gives quotient 51 (since 9*51=459, remainder 8). For n=11: 1155/11 gives quotient 105 exactly. For n=12: 2683/12 gives quotient 223 with remainder 7.\nMaybe these quotients are related to triangular numbers or something? \n28 is the 4th tetrahedral number maybe.\n\nCheck differences:\nf(7)=10, f(8)=28, difference =18.\nf(9)=51, difference =23.\nf(11)=105, difference from 51=54.\nf(12)=223, difference=118.\n\nNot obviously polynomial.\n\nMaybe they are computed by: f(n) = (n^3 - n)/? For n=8: (512-8)/something... Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is simply to express each key in the form k_n = n * f(n) + g(n), and then list the values of f(n):\n- For k7: f(7)=10.\n- For k8: f(8)=28.\n- For k9: f(9)=51.\n- For k11: f(11)=105.\n- For k12: f(12)=223.\n\nBut I'm not fully confident because we guessed the remainders from division of given numbers. Let me re-read the original text carefully:\n\n\"Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nIt might be that the keys are expressed as: \nk_n = n*f(n) + g(n), where f(n) and g(n) are functions.\nMaybe there is a recurrence or pattern.\n\nI see relations: k5 = k2 * k3. And k12 = k8*12 - 5.\nMaybe these imply that for composite indices, the multiplier function f(n) can be expressed in terms of previous values. For example:\nFor n=12, maybe f(12) = something like (k8/?) but not sure.\n\nWait, check: k12 = k8 * 12 - 5. We know k8 = 224. So then k12 would equal 224*12 - 5 = 2688 - 5 = 2683, which matches the given number for k12.\nNow if we write that as k12 = 12*f(12) + g(12), then 2683 = 12*f(12) + g(12). And also, k8 = 224 = 8*f(8) + g(8) with f(8)=28 and g(8)=0.\nSo maybe the rule is: for composite numbers n (like 5 and 12), we have a relationship involving multiplication of previous keys. For n=5, k5 = k2 * k3; that might also be expressed in the form 5*f(5) + g(5). Then f(5) would equal (k2*k3 - g(5))/5.\nBut without knowing k2 and k3, we cannot compute f(5).\n\nMaybe the keys are defined by a rule: \nFor n=1, k1 = 1.\nFor prime n, maybe k_n is defined as something like \"the product of the two smallest primes greater than n\", but then for composite numbers, it's defined differently.\n\nIt might be that only some keys have been computed and given explicitly in this problem. The ones we can use are: \nk7 = 76,\nk8 = 224,\nk9 = 467,\nk11 = 1155,\nk12 = 2683.\nSo I'll assume these are the keys.\n\nThen f(n) is defined as the integer part of k_n divided by n when k_n can be written in that form. So:\nFor key 7: 76 / 7 = 10 remainder 6, so f(7)=10.\nKey 8: 224/8 = 28 exactly, so f(8)=28.\nKey 9: 467/9, integer part is 51 because 9*51=459 and remainder 8, so f(9)=51.\nKey 11: 1155/11 = 105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\nKey 12: 2683/12, integer division gives quotient =223 (because 12*223=2676, remainder 7), so f(12)=223.\n\nThus the answer is:\nf(7) = 10,\nf(8) = 28,\nf(9) = 51,\nf(11) = 105,\nf(12) = 223.\n\nThat is likely what they want.\n\nBut wait, check key 5: \"k5 = k2 * k3\" so if we assume that f(n) and g(n) representation holds for all keys, then maybe we can compute f(5) if we know k2 and k3. Possibly k2=2, k3=3 would be natural choices? But then k5 would equal 6, and writing 6 as 5*f(5)+g(5), the quotient would be 1 with remainder 1. So f(5)=1 if that's assumed.\nMaybe k2 = ? \nAlternatively, maybe the sequence starts at n=7.\n\nThe CHECK list includes keys 7,8,9,11,12, so perhaps the sequence of interest is from key 7 onwards. \n\nThus I'll answer for those keys:\nFor key 7: f(7)=10,\nfor key 8: f(8)=28,\nfor key 9: f(9)=51,\nfor key 11: f(11)=105,\nfor key 12: f(12)=223.\n\nI will now provide the answer in plain text.\n\nI'll say:\n\nGiven that each key k_n can be written as n*f(n) + g(n), we compute:\nFor n=7: k_7 = 76, so 76 = 7*10 + 6, hence f(7)=10.\nFor n=8: k_8 = 224, so 224 = 8*28 + 0, hence f(8)=28.\nFor n=9: k_9 = 467, so 467 = 9*51 + 8, hence f(9)=51.\nFor n=11: k_11 = 1155, so 1155 = 11*105 + 0, hence f(11)=105.\nFor n=12: k_12 = 2683, so 2683 = 12*223 + 7, hence f(12)=223.\n\nThus, the multipliers are as above.\n\nI'll now produce final answer accordingly.</think>We will show that if every key k\u2099 is written in \u201cdivided\u2010form\u201d\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = n\u00b7f(n) + g(n)\nthen for some of the keys the number f(n) (the \u201cmultiplier\u201d when k\u2099 is divided by n) comes out as follows.\n\nFor example, suppose that the following keys have been computed:\n\u2003\u2003k\u2087 = 76,\u2003k\u2088 = 224,\u2003k\u2089 = 467,\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 1155,\u2003and\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 2683.\nThen we write each as\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = n\u00b7f(n) + g(n)\nand compute f(n) by \u201cdividing\u201d k\u2099 by n (choosing the unique integer quotient).\n\nLet\u2019s do this step\u2010by\u2010step:\n\n1. For n = 7:\n\u2003\u200376 divided by 7 gives\n\u2003\u2003\u20037 \u00d7 10 = 70\u2003with remainder 6.\nSo we have\n\u2003\u2003k\u2087 = 7\u00b710 + 6\u2003and thus f(7) = 10.\n\n2. For n = 8:\n\u2003\u2003224 divided by 8 gives\n\u2003\u2003\u20038 \u00d7 28 = 224\u2003with remainder 0.\nSo we have\n\u2003\u2003k\u2088 = 8\u00b728 + 0\u2003and thus f(8) = 28.\n\n3. For n = 9:\n\u2003\u2003467 divided by 9 gives\n\u2003\u2003\u20039 \u00d7 51 = 459\u2003with remainder 8 (since 9\u00d752 = 468 is too big).\nThus,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2089 = 9\u00b751 + 8\u2003and so f(9) = 51.\n\n4. For n = 11:\n\u2003\u20031155 divided by 11 gives\n\u2003\u2003\u200311 \u00d7 105 = 1155\u2003with remainder 0.\nThus,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 11\u00b7105 + 0\u2003and so f(11) = 105.\n\n5. For n = 12:\n\u2003\u20032683 divided by 12 gives\n\u2003\u2003\u200312 \u00d7 223 = 2676\u2003with remainder 7 (since 12\u00d7224 = 2688 is too high).\nThus,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 12\u00b7223 + 7\u2003and so f(12) = 223.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the problem tells us that for some composite numbers a relation holds. For instance, we are given k\u2085 = k\u2082 \u00b7 k\u2083 and k\u2081\u2082 = k\u2088\u00b712 \u2013 5. (In the case n = 12 one may check that indeed 2683 = 224\u00d712 \u2013 5.) In any event, when the key is written as\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = n\u00b7f(n) + g(n),\nthe value of f(n) is just the quotient upon dividing k\u2099 by n.\n\nThus, our answers are:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003f(7) = 10  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003f(8) = 28  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003f(9) = 51  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003f(11) = 105  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003f(12) = 223\n\nThis is the answer as required.",
