We see formula: k12 = k8 * 12 -5, and observation that sometimes the index appears in the formula; so maybe there's a pattern like k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). The user provided sample calculations for various n values: For example, k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7=10.86 (not clean) while k8 yields integer quotient 224/8 =28; k9 yields non-integer quotient; k11 yields integer quotient.\n\nI need to determine f(n) from the given equations for k8 and k11, etc.\n\nWait, let's re-read carefully:\n\nThe user message says:\n```\nINDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n```\n\nThus, we see that for key k8 and k11 there are formulas:\n\nk8 = f(8)*8 + g(8) yields: 224/8 = 28. So presumably f(8)=28? Wait, no, let me re-read:\nThey check: \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8\" It looks like they are doing division of key value by the index and get an integer.\n\nFor k11: k11 = ? * 11 + ? gives 1155/11=105, so f(11)=? but from calculation it seems that quotient is 105. So maybe for k8, \"f(8) = 28\" and for k11, \"f(11)=105\". For k12: They check k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12=223.58... but then note \"k8\u00d712-5=2683\", so they are re-interpreting it as k8 times 12 minus 5 equals 28*12 - 5 =336-5=331? Wait check: k8=224, not 28. Wait careful:\n\nWe have key values:\n- k7 is given as \"76\" (maybe)\n- k8 = 224\n- k9 = 467\n- k11 = 1155\n- k12 = 2683\n\nWait let's parse: In the check list,\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7=10.86 so I deduce that maybe k7=76.\n2. k8, then we have \"224/8 = 28\", so k8 is likely 224.\n3. k9 yields 467/9 gives ~51.89 so k9=467.\n4. k11 yields 1155/11=105 integer.\n5. k12 yields 2683/12=223.58... not integer, but then \"k8\u00d712-5=2683\" implies that maybe the pattern is sometimes \"k_n = k_{something} * n - something\".\n\nWait: The original observation said:\nObservations: \n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (so k2 and k3 multiply to produce k5).\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\n\nThe hypothesis: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula. So we are trying to check if there is a pattern where k_n = f(n)*n + g(n).\n\nNow \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" seems like a request: Provide the function f(n) for keys, using data: For n=7,8,9,11,12.\n\nWe have:\nFor k8: 224/8 = 28. So that suggests f(8)=28.\nFor k11: 1155/11=105, so f(11)=105.\nFor k12: But they don't want to compute it as quotient because it's not clean. They provided alternative expression: k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5, and since k8=224 then 224*12-5 = 2688-5=2683.\n\nNow the question: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\" We have keys: n = ? The provided keys are: k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, and k12. But we only have numbers for some of these indices.\n\nWe need to compute f(5), f(7), f(8), f(9), f(11), f(12)? Possibly yes.\n\nGiven the provided information:\n\nk5: It is said \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\". So that's not directly in the form f(5)*5 + g(5) but maybe we can compute f(5) if we know values of k2 and k3. But then we have no explicit numbers for k2 and k3.\n\nWe do see: k7=76, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, k12=2683.\nWait, are these keys? It says \"CHECK:\" with list items:\n1) k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2) k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713\n3) k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4) k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5) k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo we have explicit key values:\nk7=76, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, and k12=2683.\n\nNow check if pattern \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\" exists for these keys. For some indices like 8 and 11 the quotient (k_n divided by n) is an integer: f(8)=224/8=28 and f(11)=1155/11=105, but for others it's not.\n\nSo question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" might be interpreted as: For which keys does f(n) = k_n / n come out to be an integer? And what are those values? So answer would be:\nFor k7, f(7)=76/7 is not an integer (approx 10.857). \nFor k8, f(8)=28 exactly.\nFor k9, f(9)=467/9 approx 51.888... no integer.\nFor k11, f(11)=105 exactly.\nFor k12, if we use the division form then f(12)=2683/12 is not an integer; but there's another expression: k8 * 12 -5 = 224*12-5=2688-5=2683. So that fits the pattern: k12 can be expressed as (k8)*12 - 5. But then f(12) in the form f(n)*n + g(n)? In that expression, if we write it as: k12 = 224*12 -5, but that's not of the form f(12)*12 + g(12), unless you let f(12)=? No, wait: If we want to match f(n)*n + g(n) with k8\u00d712-5, then we can set f(12)=k8? That seems odd. Let me re-read: They have \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ?\" and then they say \"2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". So they want to express k12 in terms of k8, which is itself f(8)*8 (with f(8)=28). So maybe pattern: sometimes f(n) is computed from previous key values.\n\nMaybe we need to find a function f(n) such that for those keys where it works out, k_n = f(n)*n. For example, for k11=1155, 1155/11=105 exactly so f(11)=105; for k8=224, 224/8=28, so f(8)=28.\n\nMaybe pattern: f(n) is given by (something like n! formula)? But not sure.\n\nLet's list keys and their values from observation:\n- k2? Not provided.\n- k3? Not provided.\n- k5 = k2 * k3. So if we had k2 and k3, then f(5)=? It might be computed as (k2*k3)/5 if that is integer.\n\n- k7=76.\n- k8=224.\n- k9=467.\n- k11=1155.\n- k12=2683.\n\nNow the pattern \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\" maybe comes from a sequence known in puzzle or math challenge? Possibly keys represent something like prime factorization or similar. But we don't have additional context from conversation except the provided calculations.\n\nThe question: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" I think they want to compute f(7), f(8), f(9), f(11), f(12). And maybe also f(5)? Possibly yes.\n\nWe see that when dividing k_n by n, sometimes it is not an integer. For example:\nf(7)=76/7 \u2248 10.85714286.\nBut wait, they said \"not clean\" means it's not a whole number; so in these cases, maybe f(n) is not defined as an integer? But then for k8 and k11, the division yields integers.\n\nMaybe pattern: f(5)=? if we had k2 and k3. We don't have values though. Let me check: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" means that if we assume k2 is a key with index 2 and k3 is a key with index 3, then maybe they are numbers? Possibly from some known sequence like factorial numbers or something else.\n\nAlternatively, could it be that f(n) represents the quotient when you divide the key by n (if divisible)? And if not an integer, then the pattern doesn't hold. But then what is g(n)? The question asks \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)?\" meaning maybe sometimes f(n) appears multiplied by index and sometimes we add an offset.\n\nFor keys: \nk8=224 can be written as 28*8+0, so f(8)=28, g(8)=0.\nk11=1155 can be written as 105*11+0, so f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\nBut k12=2683 doesn't work as quotient integer: if we write it as ? * 12 + ? then maybe the formula is different? They mention \"but k8\u00d712-5=2683\", which suggests that for k12, you can express it as (k8)*12 - 5. But note that k8 itself was 224 =28*8. So k12= (28*8) * 12 - 5 =28*96 -5 = 2688-5=2683. That is not in the form f(12)*12 + g(12) unless you set f(12)=? Not sure.\n\nLet's check: if we want to express k12 as f(12)*12 + g(12), then f(12) would be (k12 - g(12))/12. We are free to choose g(12). But the observed pattern might be that sometimes f(n) is equal to a previous key value divided by something, or maybe related to index.\n\nLet me re-read: \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\" So maybe for k8 and k11, we got a clean division by 8 and 11. For others, like k7 and k9, dividing by the index gives non-integer numbers. For k12, it's not an integer either unless you incorporate k8.\n\nMaybe pattern: f(2)=? f(3)=? f(5)=? f(7)=? f(8)=28; f(9)=? f(11)=105; and then maybe f(12) = ? But the question is \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" The keys that are provided in the check: k7, k8, k9, k11, k12.\n\nSo I'd list them:\nFor n=7: f(7)=76/7 = 10.857... So if we require integer, it's not integer.\nFor n=8: f(8)=224/8 = 28 exactly.\nFor n=9: f(9)=467/9 \u2248 51.888...\nFor n=11: f(11)=1155/11 =105 exactly.\nFor n=12: if we try division by 12, we get non-integer but maybe it is expressed in terms of k8: f(12) could be computed as (k8\u00d712 -5)/12. But that equals k8 - 5/12? That doesn't seem neat.\n\nWait, let me recalc: For n=12, the expression \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ?\" might be interpreted differently: They wrote \"2683/12 = 223.58...\" but then note that if we use k8 * 12 - 5 (which equals 224*12-5), we get exactly 2683. That suggests a pattern: sometimes, the multiplication factor f(n) is not simply k_n / n, but can be constructed from previous keys.\n\nMaybe there's an underlying recurrence relation that defines these keys? For example:\nk5 = k2 * k3.\nk12 = k8 * 12 - 5.\nSo maybe in general, for some indices n, f(n) might equal (previous key multiplied by something minus a constant)/n. So then the formula for k_n is not uniformly of the form f(n)*n + g(n), but sometimes it involves previous keys and indices.\n\nThe question \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" might be interpreted as: Given the provided data, what are the values of f(7), f(8), f(9), f(11), and f(12)? They already computed f(8)=28 and f(11)=105. For others, if we define f(n) = (k_n - g(n))/n where g(n) is chosen such that the result is an integer? But then for k7 and k9 they are not integers unless you choose a particular g(n). Perhaps g(n) is allowed to be fractional?\n\nMaybe the pattern intended: k7 = 10 * 7 + 6, so f(7)=10 and g(7)=6.\nk8= 28*8 + 0, so f(8)=28, g(8)=0.\nk9= 51*9 + 8? Let's try: 51*9 =459, plus 8 gives 467. Yes! That works: k9 = 51*9 + 8, so f(9) = 51 and g(9)=8.\nk11= 105*11 + 0, so f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\nAnd for k12: They provided an alternative expression: k12 = 223*12 + ? Let's try to see if that works: 223*12 =2676, plus 7 gives 2683. So then f(12) would be 223 and g(12)=7.\n\nLet me check consistency: For n=7, if we write 76 as A*7 + B, what integer choices? The division yields quotient 10 remainder 6 because 10*7 =70, remainder 6 gives 76. So yes, f(7)=10 and g(7)=6.\nFor n=8, 224 = 28*8 +0, so f(8)=28, g(8)=0.\nFor n=9, 467 = 51*9 + 8, since 51*9=459 and remainder is 8, so f(9)=51 and g(9)=8.\nFor n=11, 1155 = 105*11 + 0, so f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\nFor n=12, 2683 divided by 12: 12*223 =2676 remainder 7. So that gives f(12)=223 and g(12)=7.\n\nThis is a plausible interpretation if the pattern they're trying to see is that sometimes k_n can be written as an integer multiple of n plus a remainder that might be another key or something? And then note for some keys, like k8 and k11, the remainder is 0. And also observe: f(7)=10, f(9)=51, f(12)=223. There's possibly a pattern among these numbers: 10, 28, 51, 105, 223. Do they relate? The differences: 28-10=18, 51-28=23, 105-51=54, 223-105=118. Not obviously arithmetic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intended interpretation was simply to check if k_n/n is an integer and then define f(n) = that integer, but then for n=7 and n=9 it's not, so maybe g(n) is nonzero. Then \"g(7)=76-10*7=6\", \"g(8)=0\", \"g(9)=467-51*9=8\", \"g(11)=0\", \"g(12)=2683 - ?\". We need to find a pattern: maybe g(n) relates to previous indices? For k5, if that were given as f(5)*5 + g(5), we could try to see if there's any relation with 6 (for n=7). But without more context it's hard.\n\nMaybe the idea is: \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" means just compute floor division of k_n by n. For integer keys where this division yields an integer, that's f(n); for others, f(n) might be expressed in terms of previous keys like k8.\n\nObserving the given examples:\n- For k7=76, 76/7 is not whole, so maybe f(7)=floor(76/7)=10, with remainder 6.\n- For k8=224, division gives exactly 28, so f(8)=28, g(8)=0.\n- For k9=467, division gives quotient 51 and remainder 8.\n- For k11=1155, division yields 105 exactly, so f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\n- For k12=2683, if we try to express it as something * 12 + something, the natural division gives quotient =223 and remainder =7.\n\nSo the answer might be:\nf(7)=10 (with remainder 6)\nf(8)=28\nf(9)=51 (with remainder 8)\nf(11)=105\nf(12)=223 (with remainder 7)\n\nAnd then maybe note that these f(n) values sometimes match other key numbers. For instance, f(12)=223 and notice 223 appears as the multiplier in k12 if we write it as 223*12+7, but 223 itself is not one of the keys given before (k8=224, etc.). Alternatively, maybe pattern: f(n) = k_(n-?) something.\n\nI can check if there's a recurrence: k5 = k2*k3, so f(5)=? But we don't know k2 and k3.\n\nMaybe the intended answer is simply:\nFor key 7: f(7) = 10.\nFor key 8: f(8) = 28.\nFor key 9: f(9) = 51.\nFor key 11: f(11) = 105.\nFor key 12: f(12) = 223.\n\nI can also mention the remainders if needed.\n\nThus answer:\nk7 = 10*7 + 6, so f(7)=10 and g(7)=6.\nk8 = 28*8 + 0, so f(8)=28 and g(8)=0.\nk9 = 51*9 + 8, so f(9)=51 and g(9)=8.\nk11 = 105*11 + 0, so f(11)=105 and g(11)=0.\nk12 = 223*12 + 7, so f(12)=223 and g(12)=7.\n\nAlso note: k5 = k2 * k3, but we don't have its division form given.\n\nI think that is the intended resolution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want to see if there's a pattern in these f values. They are 10, 28, 51, 105, 223 for indices 7,8,9,11,12 respectively. That might be part of a puzzle from some riddle \"The key of the door\" or something.\n\nI will now prepare answer accordingly. I'll mention that sometimes k_n can be expressed in the form f(n)*n + g(n) where f(n) is the quotient and g(n) the remainder, and then list them.\n\nThus final answer:\n\nFor n=7: 76 = 10\u00d77 + 6, so f(7)=10.\nFor n=8: 224 = 28\u00d78 + 0, so f(8)=28.\nFor n=9: 467 = 51\u00d79 + 8, so f(9)=51.\nFor n=11: 1155 = 105\u00d711 + 0, so f(11)=105.\nFor n=12: 2683 = 223\u00d712 + 7, so f(12)=223.\n\nI'll provide this as answer with explanation. I'll also mention that in the cases where division is not an integer, we choose the quotient (floor) and note the remainder.\n\nI need to be careful: The problem might be ambiguous but likely expects these values.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.</think>We\u2019ll show one acceptable way to \u201cread\u2010off\u201d a function f(n) from keys written in the form\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n).\n\nIn many cases (but not all) the division k\u2099/n comes out exactly as an integer; when it does we can take that quotient to be f(n) and then the \u201cleftover\u201d is zero. When the division isn\u2019t exact one common approach is to write\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = Q\u00b7n + R,\nwhere Q = floor(k\u2099/n) (the whole\u2010number part of the quotient) and R is the remainder.\n\nIn the \u201ccheck\u2013list\u201d below we have been given five keys:\n\n\u2003\u2022 k\u2087 = 76  \n\u2003\u2022 k\u2088 = 224  \n\u2003\u2022 k\u2089 = 467  \n\u2003\u2022 k\u2081\u2081 = 1155  \n\u2003\u2022 k\u2081\u2082 = 2683\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens when we \u201cdivide\u201d each key by its index.\n\n1. For n = 7:  \n\u2003Divide 76 by 7. Since 10\u00d77 = 70 and 11\u00d77 = 77 is too high, we have  \n\u2003\u200376 = 10\u00b77 + 6.  \n\u2003Thus one may take f(7) = 10 (and g(7) = 6).\n\n2. For n = 8:  \n\u2003Divide 224 by 8. Here 28\u00d78 = 224 exactly, so there is no remainder. That is,  \n\u2003\u2003224 = 28\u00b78 + 0.  \n\u2003Thus f(8) = 28 and g(8) = 0.\n\n3. For n = 9:  \n\u2003Divide 467 by 9. Note that 51\u00d79 = 459 and 52\u00d79 = 468 is too high so we write  \n\u2003\u2003467 = 51\u00b79 + 8.  \n\u2003Thus f(9) = 51 and g(9) = 8.\n\n4. For n = 11:  \n\u2003Divide 1155 by 11. Since 105\u00d711 = 1155 exactly, we have  \n\u2003\u20031155 = 105\u00b711 + 0.  \n\u2003Thus f(11) = 105 and g(11) = 0.\n\n5. For n = 12:  \n\u2003Divide 2683 by 12. We see that 223\u00d712 = 2676 and 224\u00d712 = 2688 is too high so  \n\u2003\u20032683 = 223\u00b712 + 7.  \n\u2003Thus f(12) = 223 and g(12) = 7.\n\nOne acceptable answer is therefore:\n\n\u2003\u2022 k\u2087 = 10\u00b77 + 6\u2003\u27f9\u2003f(7) = 10  \n\u2003\u2022 k\u2088 = 28\u00b78 + 0\u2003\u27f9\u2003f(8) = 28  \n\u2003\u2022 k\u2089 = 51\u00b79 + 8\u2003\u27f9\u2003f(9) = 51  \n\u2003\u2022 k\u2081\u2081 = 105\u00b711 + 0\u2003\u27f9\u2003f(11) = 105  \n\u2003\u2022 k\u2081\u2082 = 223\u00b712 + 7\u2003\u27f9\u2003f(12) = 223\n\nThis shows one way to \u201cextract\u201d a function f(n) from the keys written in the form\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n). \n\nNote that in some cases (like n = 8 and n = 11) the division is exact so that g(n)=0, while for other values (such as n = 7, 9, or 12) a nonzero remainder appears. Any answer equivalent to the one above is correct.",
