  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence, which is usually something like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}. The user gave me two equations based on the terms k7 = 76 and k8 = 224. The equations are:\n\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\n224 = 76a + 49b\n\nThey also mentioned trying a recurrence with a constant term added, like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c. Hmm, I should first focus on the linear recurrence without the constant, see if that works, and if not, then try the constant version.\n\nStarting with the first two equations. Let me write them down again:\n\n1) 49a + 21b = 76\n\n2) 76a + 49b = 224\n\nI need to solve for a and b. Since there are two equations and two variables, maybe I can use substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination. Let me see if I can multiply the first equation by something and the second by something else so that the coefficients of one variable match up.\n\nLet me see, if I multiply the first equation by 76 and the second by 49, maybe? Wait, that might get too big. Alternatively, perhaps multiplying the first equation by 49 and the second by 21 so that the coefficients of b can be eliminated? Let's try that.\n\nWait, actually, let me think step by step.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\nEquation 1: 49a + 21b = 76\n\nEquation 2: 76a + 49b = 224\n\nLet me try to eliminate one variable. Let's try to eliminate 'a' first. To do that, I can multiply Equation 1 by 76 and Equation 2 by 49, then subtract the equations?\n\nWait, actually, the coefficients of 'a' would be 49\u00d776 and 76\u00d749, so they would be the same, so if I subtract the equations, it would eliminate 'a'? Wait, but actually, let me see:\n\nWait, if I multiply Equation 1 by 76:\n\n76*(49a + 21b) = 76*76\n\nWhich is 76*49a + 76*21b = 76\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, multiply Equation 2 by 49:\n\n49*(76a + 49b) = 49*224\n\nWhich is 49*76a + 49\u00b2b = 49*224\n\nNow subtract the second equation from the first?\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe solve for one variable in terms of another.\n\nLet me solve Equation 1 for a:\n\nFrom Equation 1: 49a = 76 - 21b\n\nThus, a = (76 - 21b)/49\n\nThen plug this into Equation 2:\n\n76a + 49b = 224\n\nSubstitute a:\n\n76*( (76 - 21b)/49 ) + 49b = 224\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 76*(76 - 21b)/49\n\nLet me write it as (76*76)/49 - (76*21b)/49\n\nSo that's (5776)/49 - (1596b)/49\n\nThen add 49b:\n\nSo the whole equation becomes:\n\n(5776/49) - (1596b/49) + 49b = 224\n\nCombine the terms with b:\n\nFirst, note that 49b is the same as (49b * 49)/49 = (2401b)/49, but actually, to combine terms, let me express everything over 49:\n\n= (5776)/49 + [ -1596b + 2401b ] /49 = 224\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe second term is -1596b/49 + 49b\n\nConvert 49b to (49b)*(49/49) = (2401b)/49, so adding:\n\n-1596b + 2401b = (2401 -1596)b = 805b\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n(5776 + 805b)/49 = 224\n\nMultiply both sides by 49:\n\n5776 + 805b = 224*49\n\nCompute 224*49: 224*50 would be 11200, subtract 224 gives 11200 - 224 = 10976\n\nSo:\n\n5776 + 805b = 10976\n\nSubtract 5776 from both sides:\n\n805b = 10976 - 5776\n\nCalculate 10976 - 5776:\n\n10976 - 5000 = 5976, then subtract 776 more: 5976 - 776 = 5200\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait 10976 minus 5776:\n\n10976 - 5000 = 5976\n\n5976 - 776 = 5200\n\nYes, so 805b = 5200\n\nThus, b = 5200 / 805\n\nSimplify this fraction.\n\nLet's see if 5 divides both:\n\n5200 \u00f75 = 1040; 805 \u00f75 = 161\n\nSo 1040/161\n\nHmm, 161 is 23*7, 1040 divided by 7? 1040 \u00f77 \u2248148.57, so no. 1040/161. Let me check 161*6 = 966, 1040 - 966 =74, so 6 and 74/161. Doesn't seem like an integer. Hmm, so b is a fraction? But the problem said \"Can we find integer a, b?\" So maybe there are no integer solutions here?\n\nWait that's a problem. Maybe I made a calculation error?\n\nLet me check the steps again.\n\nStarting from equation 1: 49a +21b =76\n\nSolved for a: a=(76 -21b)/49\n\nThen plugged into equation 2:\n\n76*( (76 -21b)/49 ) +49b =224\n\nCalculating 76*(76 -21b)/49:\n\nFirst compute numerator: 76*76=5776; 76*(-21b)= -1596b. So numerator is 5776-1596b, over 49.\n\nSo the first term is (5776 -1596b)/49.\n\nThen adding 49b:\n\nTotal equation:\n\n(5776 -1596b)/49 +49b = 224\n\nCombine terms over 49:\n\n[5776 -1596b +49b*49]/49 =224\n\nWait, 49b is equivalent to (49b *49)/49? Wait no, actually, 49b is equal to (49b *49)/49? Wait, actually, no, that would be 2401b over 49. Wait, maybe my mistake here.\n\nWait, actually, to combine the terms, the second term is 49b, which is 49b*(49/49) = (49^2 b)/49 = 2401b/49.\n\nWait, so:\n\n[5776 -1596b +2401b]/49 =224\n\nAh, so the numerator becomes 5776 + (2401b -1596b) =5776 +805b\n\nSo numerator is 5776 +805b, divided by 49 equals 224\n\nMultiply both sides by 49:\n\n5776 +805b =224*49\n\n224*49: Let me recalculate that to be sure.\n\n49*200=9800, 49*24=1176, so 9800+1176=10976. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThus 5776 +805b=10976\n\nSubtract 5776:\n\n805b=10976-5776=5200\n\nYes, so b=5200/805.\n\nLet me see if this reduces further. 5200 and 805.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 5200/5=1040, 805/5=161\n\n1040 and 161. Let's see if 161 divides into 1040.\n\n161*6=966, 1040-966=74. Not divisible. 161 is 23*7. 1040 divided by 7 is 148.57, not integer. Divided by 23: 1040/23 is about 45.21. Not integer. So it's 1040/161. Not an integer. So b is not an integer. Hmm.\n\nTherefore, there is no integer solution for a and b. So the Fibonacci-like recurrence with just a and b (no constant term) does not hold for these terms.\n\nHmm, but maybe the user also mentioned trying a recurrence with a constant term c: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} +c. Let me try that.\n\nSo now, with three variables a, b, c, but only two equations? Wait, but maybe we need more terms. Wait, the problem mentions predicting k15 and k16, so maybe there's more terms given? Wait, the user only provided k7 and k8 here. Wait, actually, the original problem might have had more terms, but in the user's message, they only mention k7=76 and k8=224, and they want to see if a recurrence can be found for those. But with two equations, even with a constant term, we can only set up two equations but have three variables. Hmm. Maybe there is missing information? Or perhaps the user had more terms in their problem but only included these here? Wait, looking back at the original problem statement, it says \"TEST: Can we find a, b such that k7 = 76 and k8=224 follow a recurrence...\" So maybe the earlier terms (k5, k6, etc.) are known? Wait, in the equations given, for k7, they used k6 and k5? Because the recurrence is k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}. So for k7, that would be a\u00d7k6 + b\u00d7k5. But in the equations provided, the user wrote:\n\n\"For k7 = 76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\"\n\nAh, so they assumed that k6=49 and k5=21? Because otherwise, how else would they get 49a +21b?\n\nSimilarly for k8 =224: 224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749, so here they must be using k7=76 and k6=49?\n\nTherefore, the user might have assumed that prior terms are known? Let me see:\n\nSo if k5 =21, k6=49, then k7=76, k8=224. So the prior terms are known, so the equations are set up correctly. Then with that, we can set up two equations with two variables (a and b). Since they are looking for integer a and b, but we saw that b is fractional. So maybe no integer solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the prior terms are not 21 and 49? Wait, perhaps the user is using variable names differently? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an arithmetic mistake?\n\nLet me check the calculation again. Let me try solving the two equations again with another method.\n\nFirst equation: 49a +21b =76\n\nSecond equation:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me try elimination. Let me multiply the first equation by 49 and the second equation by 21 so that the coefficients of b will be 21*49 and 49*21, so that when subtracted, we can eliminate b?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nMultiply first equation by 49:\n\n49*(49a +21b)=49*76 => 49\u00b2a + 49*21b = 49*76\n\nMultiply second equation by 21:\n\n21*(76a +49b)=21*224 => 21*76a +21*49b =21*224\n\nNow subtract the second new equation from the first new equation:\n\n[49\u00b2a + 49*21b] - [21*76a +21*49b] = 49*76 -21*224\n\nLeft side:\n\n49\u00b2a -21*76a + (49*21b -21*49b) = 0 (since the b terms cancel out)\n\nWait, yes, the b terms: 49*21b -21*49b =0. So we are left with:\n\n(49\u00b2 -21*76)a =49*76 -21*224\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\nFirst, compute 49\u00b2: 49*49=2401\n\n21*76: 21*70=1470, 21*6=126; total 1470+126=1596\n\nThus, coefficient of a is 2401 -1596 = 805\n\nRight side: 49*76 -21*224\n\nCompute 49*76: 49*70=3430, 49*6=294 \u2192 3430+294=3724\n\n21*224: 20*224=4480, 1*224=224 \u2192 4480+224=4704\n\nThus, right side: 3724 -4704 = -980\n\nTherefore, equation is:\n\n805a = -980\n\nWait, that gives a = -980 /805\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: -196 / 161\n\nHmm, so a is -196/161. Which is also not an integer. Wait, so that's different from before? Wait, but in my first approach I had a in terms of b, but now this is solving for a directly.\n\nWait, so if I do elimination, I get a= -980 /805 = let's see, 980 divided by 5 is 196, 805 divided by 5 is 161, so -196/161.\n\nHmm. So that's -1.217... So again, not an integer. So this confirms that there are no integer solutions for a and b. Therefore, the Fibonacci-like recurrence without a constant term does not hold here.\n\nHmm, so maybe the user needs to consider a recurrence with a constant term, like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} +b\u00d7k_{n-2} +c.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo now, we have three variables: a, b, c, but only two equations. Wait, but with the constant term, we need more equations to solve for three variables. Maybe the user has more terms? The user mentioned k15 and k16, so perhaps they have more terms? But in the problem statement here, they only provided k7 and k8, so maybe I need to assume prior terms?\n\nWait, looking back, in the equations given for k7 and k8, the user used k6 and k5. For k7: 76 = a\u00d749 +b\u00d721. So they must be using k6=49 and k5=21. Similarly, for k8: 224 =a\u00d776 +b\u00d749, so using k7=76 and k6=49. Therefore, the prior terms are known: k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224. So perhaps if I include the prior terms, I can set up more equations?\n\nWait, but the problem is to find a, b, c such that the recurrence holds for these terms. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the recurrence is k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} +b\u00d7k_{n-2} +c.\n\nWe can use the known terms to set up equations.\n\nLet me list the known terms:\n\nk5 =21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224.\n\nSo, for term k7:\n\nk7 = a\u00d7k6 +b\u00d7k5 +c \u2192 76 =a\u00d749 +b\u00d721 +c \u2192 equation 1: 49a +21b +c =76\n\nFor term k8:\n\nk8 =a\u00d7k7 +b\u00d7k6 +c \u2192224 =a\u00d776 +b\u00d749 +c \u2192 equation 2:76a +49b +c =224\n\nNow, to solve for a, b, c, we need a third equation. Since we have four terms (k5 to k8), we can use term k6 to get a third equation.\n\nWait, term k6 is 49. To get k6, we would need k5 and k4. But k4 is unknown. Unless we assume the recurrence starts earlier. Alternatively, maybe the user expects us to use the k5 term as well?\n\nWait, let's see. The recurrence relation would need to hold for all n \u2265 some starting point. If we have the recurrence starting at n=5 or something, but without knowing the prior term k4, we can't use k5 to form an equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants us to consider the recurrence starting at n=7? But that would not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to set up equations with the available terms. Since we have four terms (k5 to k8), we can write three equations:\n\nEquation1 (for k7): 49a +21b +c =76\n\nEquation2 (for k8):76a +49b +c =224\n\nEquation3 (for k6): Let's see, to get k6, it would be a\u00d7k5 +b\u00d7k4 +c. But we don't know k4. So that might not help. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in not providing more terms?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider that the recurrence must hold for all terms starting at k5? But with k5=21, then to compute k6:\n\nk6 = a\u00d7k5 +b\u00d7k4 +c \u2192 49 =a\u00d721 +b\u00d7k4 +c. But since we don't know k4 or c, this introduces another variable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the recurrence starts at k7? That is, the recurrence only applies from n=7 onward, but that would not be standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me try using the two equations we have with c:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b +c =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b +c =224\n\nSubtract equation1 from equation2:\n\n(76a -49a) + (49b -21b) + (c -c) =224 -76\n\n27a +28b =148 \u2192 equation3: 27a +28b =148\n\nNow, we can try to solve for a and b with this equation, but we still have two variables. But perhaps we can also use the previous equations. Let me see.\n\nFrom equation1: c =76 -49a -21b\n\nFrom equation2: c =224 -76a -49b\n\nTherefore, setting them equal:\n\n76 -49a -21b =224 -76a -49b\n\nRearranged:\n\n( -49a +76a ) + ( -21b +49b ) =224 -76\n\n27a +28b =148. Which is the same as equation3. So, we only have one equation with two variables. So infinitely many solutions unless we impose another condition.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects integer solutions for a, b, c. Let's see if there are integer solutions to 27a +28b =148.\n\nLet me try to solve for integers a and b.\n\nLet me express this equation as 27a =148 -28b \u2192 a=(148-28b)/27\n\nWe need (148 -28b) divisible by 27.\n\nLet me see possible integer values of b such that 148 -28b is divisible by 27.\n\nLet me try b=2:\n\n148 -28*2=148-56=92 \u2192 92/27 \u22483.407 \u2192 Not integer.\n\nb=1:148-28=120 \u2192120/27\u22484.444\u2192 no.\n\nb=3:148-84=64\u219264/27\u22482.37\u2192 no\n\nb=4:148-112=36\u219236/27=1.333\u2026\u2192 no\n\nb=5:148-140=8\u21928/27 no.\n\nb=0:148/27\u22485.48\u2026\u2192 no\n\nb= -1:148+28=176\u2192176/27\u22486.518\u2192 no\n\nHmm. Maybe b= 148 mod28?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this equation has no integer solutions. Let me see:\n\nThe equation is 27a +28b=148\n\nWe can write this as 27a =148 -28b\n\nWe can check for possible b such that 148 -28b is divisible by27.\n\nLet me write 28b \u2261148 mod27\n\n28 mod27 is1, so 28b \u2261b mod27\n\nThus equation becomes b \u2261148 mod27 mod27.\n\n148 divided by27: 27*5=135, 148-135=13. So 148 mod27=13.\n\nThus equation is b \u226113 mod27.\n\nThus, possible solutions are b=13 +27k, where k is integer.\n\nThen, substituting back:\n\na=(148 -28b)/27.\n\nLet me try b=13:\n\na=(148 -28*13)/27=(148-364)/27=(-216)/27= -8.\n\nSo a= -8, b=13.\n\nCheck if this works:\n\n27*(-8)+28*13 =-216 + 364=148. Yes.\n\nSo that is a solution. So a= -8, b=13.\n\nThen c can be found from equation1:\n\nc=76 -49a -21b\n\nPlug in a= -8, b=13:\n\nc=76 -49*(-8) -21*13 =76 +392 -273 = (76+392)=468; 468-273=195. So c=195.\n\nCheck this in equation2:\n\n76a +49b +c=76*(-8) +49*13 +195\n\n76*(-8)= -608\n\n49*13=637\n\n-608 +637=29; 29 +195=224. Which matches.\n\nSo the solution is a= -8, b=13, c=195.\n\nThus, the recurrence is k_n = -8*k_{n-1} +13*k_{n-2} +195.\n\nNow, we can check if this recurrence works for the previous terms?\n\nWait, let's test it on k6 to see if it holds.\n\nTo compute k6 using the recurrence, we need k5 and k4. Wait, but we don't have k4. Hmm, but perhaps the recurrence is supposed to start at n=7?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf the recurrence is valid for n \u22657, then to compute k7, we need k6 and k5. Since we have those, that works.\n\nSimilarly, to compute k8, need k7 and k6. That works. However, if we want to use the recurrence to compute k6, we need k5 and k4, but we don't have k4. So maybe the recurrence is intended for n \u22657, so it doesn't have to hold for n=6. But then, the problem didn't specify starting point, but given that we derived it based on the given terms, it might be okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recurrence is supposed to hold for all n \u22655? Let's check for k6:\n\nk6 = -8*k5 +13*k4 +195. But since we don't know k4, we can't verify that. However, since the problem only requires the recurrence to hold for the given terms (k7 and k8), perhaps that's sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a different solution where the recurrence also holds for k6, but that requires knowing k4. Since the problem gives us k5 to k8, perhaps the minimal assumption is that the recurrence holds starting at k7.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a= -8, b=13, c=195.\n\nThus, the answer would be the recurrence relation: k_n = -8k_{n-1} +13k_{n-2} +195. But the question says \"Please put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" Hmm, maybe they just want the values of a, b, c? Or the coefficients?\n\nWait, the problem didn't specify exactly what to find. Wait, the original problem says:\n\n\"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nWait, the original question is just the user instruction, but the actual problem might have been missed? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"F: Please put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nWait, that's the entire problem? That seems odd. Wait, perhaps the problem was in the initial message but maybe the user forgot to include it? Wait, checking again:\n\nThe user's message starts with:\n\n\"F: Please put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nWait, maybe the problem was mentioned before in the conversation? But in the current context, the user starts with that, so perhaps there was an error.\n\nWait, perhaps there was a formatting issue. Maybe the actual problem is in the initial message but got cut off? Alternatively, maybe it's a continuation from a previous problem? Since the current problem seems to be about finding a recurrence relation given some terms, but the user's initial message is incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is as follows, given the context where the user refers to \"F\" (maybe an exam question labeled F?), and the assistant's previous answer?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the recurrence relation for the given sequence k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224, which we did above, resulting in the recurrence with a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nTherefore, the final answer would be the recurrence relation, which can be written as k_n = -8k_{n-1} +13k_{n-2}+195. To present this in boxed form, maybe as coefficients: \\boxed{-8}, \\boxed{13}, \\boxed{195} but since it's a relation, perhaps writing the entire equation boxed. Alternatively, if the problem asks for the next term, but since the user instruction is unclear, but based on the thinking process, the key result is the recurrence relation with coefficients a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question was to find the next term, but with the given terms up to k8=224, the next term k9 would be computed as -8*224 +13*76 +195. Let's compute that:\n\n-8*224 = -1792\n\n13*76 = 988\n\n-1792 +988 = -804\n\n-804 +195= -609\n\nBut that might not be necessary unless the question asked for it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem was to solve for a,b,c in the recurrence k_n = a k_{n-1} +b k_{n-2} +c, given the terms k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224. In that case, the solution is a=-8, b=13, c=195, so the boxed answers would be those numbers.\n\nSince the user instruction is unclear, but based on the context of the problem (since the assistant derived those coefficients), I think the expected answer is the recurrence relation coefficients. However, given the standard way such questions are posed, maybe the problem was to find the next term in the sequence, but since the user instruction is just \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", and the problem might have been to find a, b, c for the recurrence, so the boxed coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem was to find the value of k9, which would be -609 as above, but that is negative, which seems odd. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait, let me recheck the calculation for a and b:\n\nWe had equation 27a +28b=148. We found a solution with b=13, a= (148 -28*13)/27 = (148-364)/27= (-216)/27= -8. Correct.\n\nThen c=76 -49*(-8) -21*13 =76 + 392 - 273 = 76 + 392 is 468; 468 -273 is 195. Correct.\n\nTesting equation2:\n\n76*(-8) = -608; 49*13=637; -608+637=29; 29+195=224. Correct.\n\nThus the coefficients are correct.\n\nIf the problem is to present the recurrence relation, then boxed form could be:\n\n\\boxed{k_n = -8k_{n-1} + 13k_{n-2} + 195}\n\nAlternatively, if the question is to find the next term k9, then:\n\nk9 = -8*k8 +13*k7 +195 = -8*224 +13*76 +195\n\nCalculating:\n\n-8*224 = -1792\n\n13*76 = 988\n\nAdding those: -1792 +988 = -804\n\nThen +195: -804+195= -609\n\nSo \\boxed{-609}\n\nBut without knowing the exact question, it's hard to tell. Since the user instruction is to put the final answer in a box, and the assistant's thought process derived the recurrence coefficients, but maybe the question was to find those coefficients. Alternatively, the problem might have been presented in Chinese and the translation is cut off.\n\nAlternatively, looking back at the initial user message, the user wrote:\n\n\"F: Please put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nPossibly, the \"F\" refers to a question labeled F, which in Chinese could be a problem number. Given that the assistant's process solved for a recurrence relation with coefficients a=-8, b=13, c=195, and given that the problem might be to find these coefficients, the boxed answer could be each in separate boxes, but standard practice is to present the recurrence as an equation boxed.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was to find the next term, then boxed -609.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem was in the style of: Given the sequence 21, 49, 76, 224, find the next term, assuming it follows a linear recurrence of order 2 with constant coefficients and a constant term, then the next term would be -609, which would be boxed.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but since the user's thinking process derived the recurrence coefficients and the next term, and given that the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", likely the next term is the answer expected, so \\boxed{-609}.\n\nBut to confirm, let me see if there is another possible interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the value of a, b, c in the recurrence relation, so three boxed numbers: \\boxed{-8}, \\boxed{13}, \\boxed{195}.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem might have been in Chinese and the user just pasted part of it, but given the information here, I think the most reasonable is to present the recurrence relation boxed, or the next term.\n\nSince in the problem-solving process, the key achievement was finding the recurrence, but without the exact question, it's ambiguous. However, given the user's last sentence before the\u601d\u8003starts with \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" So maybe the problem was presented before that but got cut off. Alternatively, in some contexts, the problem might be to find coefficients a,b,c for the recurrence given the terms, so the boxed answer would be the triplet (-8,13,195). But standard in math problems, if it's a recurrence relation, writing the equation is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to solve for the constants in the recurrence, so the answer is the three coefficients, boxed individually. Since the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", singular, so maybe as a combined answer: \\boxed{a=-8,\\ b=13,\\ c=195}\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was to find the recurrence relation, written as above boxed.\n\nGiven all possibilities, I will go with the recurrence relation as the final answer since that was the main result of the thinking process.\n",
