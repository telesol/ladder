  "response": "<think>We are asked: \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\" then some observed statements:\n\n- Provided observations:\n   - \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\" [the comment is maybe incomplete: maybe they meant that k5 equals the product of k2 and k3?]\n   - \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\"\n- Hypothesis: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n- Then check:\n   1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n   2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n   3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n   4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n   5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo then says: \"k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\nQuestion: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nWe have keys (numbers) with apparently associated values: k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. But the question seems to be incomplete? Possibly we must try to derive an expression like \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\" where f and g are functions of n such that these given conditions hold.\n\nWe have a set of keys with specific values: \n- The text says \"observed k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" but then \"indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no\". Not sure.\n- Then: \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\".\n\nI think the keys are defined by some pattern. Let me re-read the conversation:\n\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\nWait, I see that the text says \"k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ?\", then dividing 76 by 7 gives approx 10.86; similarly for others.\n\nIt seems that we are given values: k2, k3 maybe, etc.\n\nWe have keys:\n- k8 = 224 (because 224/8=28)\n- k11 = 1155 (because 1155/11=105)\n- k12 = 2683 (?) But then they also mention \"k8\u00d712 - 5\" equals 2683, so indeed 28*12 -5 = 336 -5? Wait no: 28*12=336, 336 -5=331, not 2683. Let me recalc: k8 is 224 (we know that from k8/8=28), then \"k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" equals 224\u00d712 - 5 = 2688 -5= 2683 indeed.\n\nSo they have a pattern where sometimes the formula is of the form: k_n = f(n) * n + g(n).\n\nAnd apparently for some keys, dividing by the index gives an integer. E.g., for n=8, k8/8=28; for n=11, k11/11=105.\n\nThe question asks: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nSo maybe we have a list of known values? The text says \"k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\", which implies that k7's value is 76, I guess, because 76 divided by 7 equals about 10.857... But then \"k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ?\" with 467 divided by 9 equals approx 51.89, so maybe k9=467.\n\nLet me list: The keys are: \n- k5 is mentioned: k5 = k2\u00d7k3. So if we know k2 and k3? Possibly they are earlier keys.\n- k7 has value 76 (as given by \"76/7\")\n- k8 has value 224\n- k9 has value 467\n- k11 has value 1155\n- k12 is mentioned as well, with value from two different formulas: one formula gives 2683 (which is computed as k8\u00d712 -5) and then dividing by 12 yields approx 223.58... but that division is not an integer.\n\nWait, \"k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7\" implies that the unknown \"?\" times 7 plus something equals 76? But actually it might be: maybe k7 can be represented as f(7)*7+g(7). And then they calculate 76/7 and get approx 10.86, meaning that f(7) is not an integer.\n\nWait I see: \"CHECK:\" followed by bullet points:\n1. For n=7, we have representation: k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ?. They then compute something like 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean). So maybe the expression for key 7 when divided by 7 is not an integer.\n2. For n=8, \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" \u2192 \"224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\". So that means f(8)=28 and g(8) must be zero? Because if it's \"f(n)*n+g(n)\" then when divided by n gives f(n)+g(n)/n. Here, since 224/8=28 exactly, that might mean that maybe g(8)=0.\n3. For n=9: \"k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ?\" \u2192 \"467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\". So f(9) is not an integer probably.\n4. For n=11: \"1155/11 = 105\", so f(11)=105 and g(11)=0 possibly.\n5. For n=12: \"2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". So that formula might be valid, which means k12 = (28*12) -5 = 336-5=331? That doesn't match, wait re-read the bullet:\n\"5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". It seems that if we try to represent k12 in form f(12)*12+g(12), we get a non-integer quotient, but we also note that if we use the formula k12 = k8*12 - 5, then since k8 is known (224) then that gives 2683. So maybe the pattern for some keys is not simply \"f(n)*n + g(n)\" with f(n)= something integer and g(n)=0, but sometimes there's an adjustment.\n\nLet me re-read original text carefully:\n\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\nThe wording \"calculate f(n) for each key\" suggests that we want to compute the coefficient when we write k_n in the form \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\". And from these examples, it appears that if k_n/n is an integer then f(n)= that integer. So:\n- For n=7: 76/7 \u2248 10.857... so maybe f(7) = floor(10.857...) or maybe rounding? But the pattern \"sometimes\" means that sometimes the quotient is not an integer.\n\nMaybe there is a sequence of keys k_n defined by some rule. Possibly the keys correspond to a sequence like: k2, k3, k5, etc. Let me try to see if these keys are something like prime numbers? 2,3,5,7,11,13? But we see key 8 and key 9 as well. So not primes.\n\nMaybe they are indices in some product pattern analysis, where each \"key\" corresponds to a particular formula involving previous keys or the index itself.\n\nI recall that there's something called \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\" maybe from puzzle sites: Possibly the sequence is defined by an iterative process where you multiply two previously defined values and sometimes add the index. The observed pattern:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3, which means key 5 equals product of keys 2 and 3.\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5, meaning key 12 is computed as key 8 times 12 then subtract 5.\n\nSo maybe the general form is: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) where sometimes f(n) or g(n) are determined by previous keys? The hypothesis is that \"sometimes the index itself appears in the formula\", meaning that sometimes you multiply n with something. And we're asked to calculate f(n) for each key.\n\nThe examples: For k8, it's 224 = 28*8 + 0, so f(8)=28.\nFor k11, it's 1155 = 105*11 + 0, so f(11)=105.\n\nWhat about k12? They computed 2683/12 \u2260 integer. But they observed that k12 equals (k8*12 -5), i.e., 224*12 -5 = 2688-5=2683, which means that if we express it in the form f(12)*12 + g(12) then f(12)=? Let's try: If we set f(12)= something and solve for g(12): 2683 = f(12)*12 + g(12). We want to compare with the expression k8*12 -5. That doesn't give an immediate integer quotient when divided by 12 because (k8=224, so 224*12=2688, minus 5 gives 2683, then divided by 12 is 223.5833...).\nMaybe we want f(n) to be the \"integer part\" of k_n/n? The question explicitly says: \"Calculate f(n) for each key\", which might mean: find the quotient when dividing k_n by n if it's an integer, or maybe determine a pattern in those quotients.\n\nLet me re-read the text carefully: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So probably we are to compute f(2), f(3), f(5), etc., but I only see values provided for k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. But maybe the keys in order: k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12? And possibly k1 as well?\n\nI need to deduce what are the known key values:\n- It says \"k2 \u00d7 k3\" appears somewhere.\n- The bullet \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\", so presumably we know k2 and k3. But their actual numeric values aren't provided explicitly in the text.\nMaybe the keys are defined as a sequence: k1, k2, ..., etc.\nIt might be that:\n- k2 is some number, maybe 12? Not sure.\nWait, \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8\" means k8=224. So we know k8=224.\nSimilarly, k11=1155, and k12=2683.\n\nWhat about k7: They mention k7 equals something with quotient of 76 divided by 7 yields ~10.857, so maybe k7 = 76 (since 76/7 is approximately 10.857). But then \"k9\" they mention 467/9 \u224851.89, so maybe k9=467.\nWhat about k5? They say \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\", but don't provide numeric value.\n\nWe might try to guess: Possibly the sequence is defined by:\nk1 = something,\nk2 = ?\nk3 = ?\nMaybe we can use provided formulas:\nFor n=7, it's not represented as integer multiple of 7.\nFor n=8, f(8)=28. So maybe f(n) is like a function that gives a product of digits? But then for n=11, f(11)=105.\n\nI recall a puzzle \"Index Product\" maybe from puzzling SE. Possibly the idea: There's a sequence where keys are defined by products and sums of previous keys with indices inserted sometimes. Perhaps f(n) might be something like: \nFor even indices, f(n) = product of digits or something? Wait, k8 is 28; then f(8)=28.\nk11=1155, so f(11)=105; note that 105 is 7*15 maybe?\nMaybe the pattern is: For n = prime numbers (like 2,3,5,7,11) we have something like: k_p = p \u00d7 something? But then k8 and k9 are not primes.\n\nWe have examples:\nk8=224. Then if we express as 28*8 + 0, so f(8)=28.\nk11=1155, so f(11)=105, with no remainder g(n).\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for keys that correspond to composite numbers (like 8 and 11) the representation yields an integer quotient when divided by n. And for other indices like 7 and 9, it doesn't work out cleanly.\nThe text: \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\" That means sometimes you see a multiplication by the index.\n\nMaybe we are supposed to derive f(n) = k_n / n (when that is integer) or otherwise determine an approximate value?\n\nThe question: \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" implies: For each key, write it as k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), and then find the function f(n). And from the checks:\n- For n=7: 76/7 \u224810.857, not an integer.\n- For n=8: 224/8=28 exactly, so f(8)=28.\n- For n=9: 467/9 \u224851.889, not integer.\n- For n=11: 1155/11=105, so f(11)=105.\n- For n=12: 2683/12 is non-integer, but we know k12 equals k8*12 -5.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for some keys, you can express them as \"previous key times index minus something\" while for others it's not that simple. The observed ones where the quotient is integer are n=2, n=3 maybe?\n\nWe haven't been given k2 and k3 values explicitly though.\nThe bullet \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" suggests that maybe k5 equals 12\u00d7? Possibly k2=?? We don't know.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a known sequence: k1, k2, ... might be the keys to a puzzle known as \"Key Sequence\" or \"Product Pattern\" from puzzling SE. Let me recall if I've seen something like that before: There is a puzzle \"Index Product Pattern\" maybe where the keys are arranged in order and some have formulas. For example, I've seen puzzles where k1= 123, k2 = something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can derive relationships:\nk5 = k2 \u00d7 k3.\nk12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5.\nSo maybe we know k8 from the representation: k8=28*8 + 0, so k8=224. Then k12 would be 224 * 12 - 5 = 2688 - 5 = 2683.\n\nWe also have k11=1155 which is exactly 105*11.\nAnd k7 is given as 76 (since 76/7=10.857... but wait, that's not an integer product).\nWhat about k9: 467? And k2, k3 unknown.\n\nMaybe the keys are:\nk1 = ?\nk2 = ? maybe 14?\nWait, what if I assume k2=12 and k3=?? Because then k5 would be product of k2 and k3. But that doesn't match with any pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can deduce f(n) for the keys where it is integer:\n- For n=8: f(8)=28.\n- For n=11: f(11)=105.\nAnd also maybe k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) might be reinterpreted as \"the key's digits are split into two parts\" or something.\n\nMaybe the idea is that you can express a number in the form (some multiplier times the index plus some remainder). And sometimes the multiplier turns out to be an integer when the number is divisible by the index. In our examples, 224/8=28 and 1155/11=105 are exact integers, so f(8)=28 and f(11)=105.\n\nMaybe we need to calculate f(n) for each key in that list: k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. And possibly others like k1 if needed.\nWe have:\nk2 is unknown but maybe can be deduced from the formula \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\". But without additional info I cannot determine them.\n\nWait, let me try: The title \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\" might refer to a puzzle where keys are like labels for positions in an ordered list. And each key is computed by a formula involving its index and sometimes the previous keys. Perhaps we can guess that f(n) = k_n / n when that division yields an integer, otherwise it's not defined.\n\nMaybe I should reinterpret: \"k_n = f(n) * n + g(n)\". The question might be asking: What is the function f(n) for each key? And from our observations:\nFor keys where the formula fits nicely (like k8 and k11), we have:\nf(8)=28, f(11)=105.\nAnd maybe also f(5)? But they gave a different pattern for k5: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\", which doesn't look like f(5)*5 plus something.\n\nWait, could it be that sometimes the key is computed by multiplying two other keys (like k2 and k3), and then we want to express that product in the form f(n)*n + g(n)? And perhaps f(n) in those cases would be (k2*k3)/5 if divisible by 5? But they don't provide numeric values.\n\nMaybe I'll try to solve using the provided numbers:\n- k7 = ? It says \"76/7\" which is approximately 10.857, so maybe k7=76 exactly.\nThen f(7) would be floor division: 76/7 = 10 remainder 6. So then f(7)=10 and g(7)=6? But they denote it as \"not clean\", meaning the quotient isn't an integer.\n- For k9, if k9=467, then 467/9 is not an integer (51 with remainder 8) so f(9)=51 maybe?\n- For k11, we have exactly 1155 which divided by 11 equals 105 exactly, so f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\n- For k12, as given, if we try to express it in the form f(12)*12 + g(12), what integer quotient do we get? 2683/12 = 223 remainder 7 (because 223*12=2676, plus 7 equals 2683). So that would yield f(12)=223 and g(12)=7.\n- For k8, as given, f(8)=28 exactly.\n\nWhat about k5? We don't know the numeric value of k5 because it's defined in terms of k2 and k3. Perhaps we can denote them symbolically: Let k2 = A and k3 = B, then k5 = A * B. And if that product divided by 5 gives an integer quotient f(5) with remainder g(5), then f(5)= floor((A*B)/5)? But without values for A and B we cannot compute.\n\nMaybe the keys are actually:\nk1 = 12\nk2 = 14?\nI recall a puzzle \"Keys to the Index\" might be from Puzzling SE. There is one called \"The Key Is in the Title\", maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intended answer: f(7) \u224810.857, f(8)=28, f(9)\u224851.889, f(11)=105, and f(12)=223.5833? But then they want integers?\n\nLet's re-read the bullet points with division signs:\n\"1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\"\nThat suggests that if we try to write k7 as something times 7 plus a remainder, the quotient is 10.86 which is not an integer.\n\"2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713\"\nSo f(8)=28 exactly.\n\"3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\"\nSo maybe if we try to find an integer multiplier for 9, it doesn't work out.\n\"4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\"\nSo f(11)=105 exactly.\n\"5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but note that k8\u00d712 -5=2683.\"\n\nThis suggests a pattern: sometimes the formula for k_n is simply an integer times n (with no remainder) and sometimes it's not.\n\nMaybe f(n) can be extracted as the integer part of k_n/n when it divides evenly, or otherwise f(n)= some other value? The hypothesis \"Sometimes the index appears in the formula\" might mean that for some keys, f(n) is exactly n times something. For instance, k11 = 105*11. And then k8=28*8.\n\nIt could be that f(n) is determined by summing the digits of something or maybe by a recurrence relation: f(7) \u224810.857, f(8)=28, f(9)\u224851.889, f(11)=105, f(12)=223 with remainder 7? But these numbers don't seem to follow an obvious pattern.\n\nMaybe the answer is just: \nf(7) = 76/7 (approximately 10.857),\nf(8) = 28,\nf(9) = 467/9 (approximately 51.889),\nf(11) = 105,\nand f(12) = 223 + 7/12? But that is messy.\n\nWait, the bullet \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28\" clearly shows that if we divide k8 by 8, we get exactly 28. So maybe they are expressing each key in the form: (f(n) times n) plus a remainder g(n). And then asking: \"What is f(n) for each key?\" That might be simply k_n divided by n, ignoring remainders? But then for keys where it doesn't divide evenly, what do we do?\n\nMaybe the intended answer: \nFor k7, f(7)=10 (since 76 = 10*7 + 6)\nFor k8, f(8)=28 (since 224=28*8+0)\nFor k9, f(9)=51 (since 467=51*9+8)\nFor k11, f(11)=105 (since 1155=105*11+0)\nFor k12, f(12)=223 (since 2683=223*12+7)\n\nThen the answer is: \nf(2) = ?; f(3) = ?; f(5) = ?; f(7) =10; f(8)=28; f(9)=51; f(11)=105; f(12)=223.\nBut we don't have k2, k3, k5.\n\nMaybe the keys are in order: k1, k2, k3, ..., and maybe we know some of them:\nI recall a puzzle \"The Key Is in the Title\" where the keys were like:\nk1 = 12\nk2 = 14\nk3 = 15\nk4 = 16\nk5 = ?\n... no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should express the answer symbolically: f(7)=\u230a76/7\u230b=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=\u230a467/9\u230b=51, f(11)=105, and f(12)=223 (if we take the integer quotient when dividing by n). \n\nThat seems plausible: they are using \"not clean\" to indicate that 76 is not a multiple of 7. But then why would one use floor division? Possibly because sometimes the key is exactly divisible by its index and sometimes it's not, so f(n) might be defined as the integer part of k_n/n when possible.\n\nI think I'll answer: \nFor k7 = 76, we have 76/7 \u224810.857, so if we write 76 = 10\u00d77 + 6, then f(7)=10 and g(7)=6.\nFor k8 = 224, since 224/8=28 exactly, we get f(8)=28 and g(8)=0.\nFor k9 = 467, dividing gives 467=51\u00d79+8, so f(9)=51 and g(9)=8.\nFor k11 =1155, 1155/11=105 exactly, so f(11)=105 and g(11)=0.\nFor k12 =2683, we have 2683=223\u00d712+7, hence f(12)=223 and g(12)=7.\n\nThat is likely the answer they want.\n\nI should also mention that k5 is defined by k2*k3, but without values for k2 and k3 this can't be computed numerically. Possibly one might say: if we let k2 = a and k3 = b, then f(5) would be floor(ab/5) and the remainder would be ab mod 5.\n\nI'll answer with what I have.\n\nI'll produce an explanation:\n\nWe want to write each key in the form k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). For some keys n=7,8,9,11,12 we can compute this:\n\u2022 For k7: given that k7=76, then 76 divided by 7 gives quotient 10 with remainder 6 (since 10\u00d77=70 and 76-70=6), so f(7)=10.\n\u2022 For k8: k8=224, and 224/8=28 exactly, so f(8)=28.\n\u2022 For k9: k9=467, dividing gives quotient 51 with remainder 8 (because 51\u00d79=459 and 467-459=8), hence f(9)=51.\n\u2022 For k11: k11=1155, and 1155/11=105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\n\u2022 For k12: k12=2683, dividing gives quotient 223 with remainder 7 (since 223\u00d712=2676 and 2683-2676=7), hence f(12)=223.\n\nSo the values of f(n) are as above. And if needed, one can note that sometimes the division is not \"clean\" meaning the key isn't exactly divisible by its index.\n\nI should also mention that k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3, but without knowing k2 and k3 we cannot compute f(5). Possibly if one knew them from context.\n\nI'll produce a final answer accordingly.</think>One way to \u201cdeconstruct\u201d a key is to write it in the form\n\n\u2003\u2003key n = (f(n)\u00d7n) + g(n)\n\nso that when you divide the number by its index n you get an integer part f(n) plus some remainder g(n). (In other words, f(n) is the \u201ccoefficient\u201d of n in writing out key n.) Sometimes this division comes out exactly (i.e. with zero remainder), and sometimes it does not.\n\nFor example, suppose we are given these keys:\n\n\u2003\u2022 k\u2087 = 76  \n\u2003\u2022 k\u2088 = 224  \n\u2003\u2022 k\u2089 = 467  \n\u2003\u2022 k\u2081\u2081 = 1155  \n\u2003\u2022 k\u2081\u2082 = 2683\n\nThen we can \u201cpeel off\u201d the f(n)\u2019s as follows:\n\n1. For k\u2087 = 76, write\n\u2003\u200376 = 10\u00d77 + 6.\n\u2003That is, f(7)=10 (with a remainder g(7)=6).\n\n2. For k\u2088 = 224, we have\n\u2003\u2003224 = 28\u00d78 + 0,\nso f(8) = 28 exactly.\n\n3. For k\u2089 = 467, note that\n\u2003\u2003467 = 51\u00d79 + 8,\nso f(9)=51 (with remainder g(9)=8).\n\n4. For k\u2081\u2081 = 1155,\n\u2003\u20031155 = 105\u00d711 + 0,\nso f(11) = 105 exactly.\n\n5. Finally, for k\u2081\u2082 = 2683,\n\u2003\u20032683 = 223\u00d712 + 7,\nso f(12)=223 (with remainder g(12)=7).\n\nThus, if you \u201cdecompose\u201d each key as (f(n)\u00d7n)+g(n), you find that:\n\u2003\u2022 f(7) = 10  \n\u2003\u2022 f(8) = 28  \n\u2003\u2022 f(9) = 51  \n\u2003\u2022 f(11) = 105  \n\u2003\u2022 f(12) = 223\n\nA note on k\u2085: In the puzzle one sometimes sees a rule like \u201ck\u2085 = k\u2082 \u00d7 k\u2083.\u201d (That is, the key for position 5 is given by multiplying the keys in positions 2 and 3.) Without knowing what k\u2082 and k\u2083 are (or their numerical values) you cannot compute f(5) numerically. One would have to know k\u2082 and k\u2083 first.\n\nSo one acceptable answer is:\n\n\u2003k\u2087 = 10\u00d77 + 6\u2003\u2192\u2003f(7)=10  \n\u2003k\u2088 = 28\u00d78 + 0\u2003\u2192\u2003f(8)=28  \n\u2003k\u2089 = 51\u00d79 + 8\u2003\u2192\u2003f(9)=51  \n\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 105\u00d711 + 0\u2003\u2192\u2003f(11)=105  \n\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 223\u00d712 + 7\u2003\u2192\u2003f(12)=223\n\nThis is one way to \u201cread off\u201d the f(n)\u2019s from the keys.",
