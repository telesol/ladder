And maybe others as well.\n\nIt suggests that for some n, we have a formula:\nk_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)\nand then the question \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" But which keys? Possibly all keys: maybe they are: k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. The statement \"f(n)\" suggests a function that multiplies n to produce part of the value.\n\nWe are given some computed results:\nFor k8, f(8)=28.\nfor k11, f(11)=105.\nAnd for k12, we get: k12 = 2683 which equals k8 \u00d7 12 -5, so then maybe f(12) could be calculated if the pattern holds? But note that dividing by n might not yield an integer sometimes.\n\nWe see observed check lines:\nFor key indices, they are performing calculation such as \"k7 = ? * 7 + ?\" and then compute quotient: \n76/7 = 10.86 (not integer) so f(7) is not integral.\nk8: 224/8 = 28 exactly, so f(8)=28 exactly. k9:467/9=51.89, not integer so f(9) is not integral maybe? k11:1155/11=105, so f(11)=105 exactly. k12:2683/12=223.58, but we know a formula holds: 2683 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5.\nSo maybe they want to calculate what the multiplier function is if it exists.\n\nBut the question asks \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" It might be that there's a pattern where sometimes k_n can be represented as n * f(n) + something. Let us denote:\nk_n = n * f(n) + g(n)\nThen, in cases when that quotient is an integer, then f(n)= k_n / n.\nWe have the following keys: maybe provided keys indices: 7,8,9,11,12.\n\nBut also the statement \"OBSERVED: - k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\" suggests that perhaps k5 is not equal to f(5)*5+g(5) in a similar pattern because it's given by product of previous keys.\nWait a minute: the initial line \"OBSERVED: - k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" might be an observed fact from earlier analysis. \nBut then they mention:\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\nSo apparently, some keys are defined by multiplying a previous key with the current index and adjusting.\n\nMaybe we can try to list known keys? Possibly the sequence of \"k\" numbers is something like: \nk2, k3, k4,... etc. But then they refer to product for k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. Then for others there are formulas?\nWe have given values:\nFor k8, value 224.\nFor k11, value 1155.\nFor k12, value 2683.\nAnd also check:\nk7: apparently equals 76.\nk9: equals 467.\nAnd maybe we can guess others? The observed product for k5 suggests that k2 and k3 might be known. But we don't know those values.\n\nWe see the pattern where sometimes f(n) = integer, so it appears to be:\nFor n=8, f(8)=224/8 = 28.\nFor n=11, f(11)=1155/11 = 105.\nFor n=12: We see a formula k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5. And then if we try dividing by 12: (k8\u00d712-5)/12 = k8 - (5/12) which is not an integer because k8=224, so that equals 224 - 0.4167 = 223.5833, so not an integer.\nFor n=7: k7/7=76/7=10.857... Not an integer.\nFor n=9: k9/9=467/9=51.888...\n\nSo only keys with indices 8 and 11 produce integers when divided by index.\n\nMaybe pattern is that f(n) equals some product or factorial? \n28 = 4 * 7, but then 105 = 5*21, maybe not.\n\nLet's try to see if there might be a relation: f(8)=28, f(11)=105. Maybe these are tetrahedral numbers or something. Tetrahedral numbers formula: T(n) = n(n+1)(n+2)/6.\nFor n=7, T(7)= 7*8*9/6 = 504/6=84, but not 28.\nMaybe f(8) equals the 4th triangular number? Triangular numbers: 1,3,6,10,15,21,28,... yes, 28 is the 7th triangular number (n=7?) Actually, check: triangular numbers sequence: T_1=1, T_2=3, wait no that's not right. Actually, triangular numbers are 1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,... Wait let me recalc: The nth triangular number is n(n+1)/2.\nFor n=7, it equals 28. So maybe f(8)= T_7 = 28.\n\nSimilarly, f(11)=105. Triangular numbers: T_14? Let's see: Which triangular number equals 105?\nT_n = n(n+1)/2 = 105 => n(n+1) =210. Solve quadratic: n^2+n-210=0. Discriminant=1+840=841, so n=( -1 + sqrt(841))/2 = ( -1+29)/2=14. So f(11)= T_14 =105.\n\nSo pattern might be that for some keys, f(n) is the triangular number with index something related to n. For k8, f(8) = T_7; for k11, f(11) = T_14.\nBut how do we get 7 and 14? They are one less than 8 and twice 7 maybe?\nMaybe pattern: f(n)= triangular number with index (n-1) if n is even or something? But then 11 is not even. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that sometimes f(n) is computed as integer division of k_n by n.\n\nWe have observed:\nk2=? and k3=? but we know k5 = k2 * k3. Maybe from these known keys we can compute others.\nLet's try to denote: Let k_n be defined for some indices, maybe there's a formula relating them? The pattern \"INDEX PRODUCT\" might refer to some sequence like \"key numbers\" that appear in a certain puzzle.\n\nMaybe it's the sequence of \"K-numbers\" where each key is generated by previous keys product and index-based formulas. It might be something like: \nk5 = k2 \u00d7 k3.\nk12 = k8 * 12 - 5.\nAnd then the hypothesis f(n)=? suggests that sometimes we can represent it as n times a function plus remainder.\n\nWe need to \"Calculate f(n) for each key\". Perhaps the keys are:\n\nn=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,...\n\nBut only some values are known: k5 = k2 * k3, so that doesn't give a direct formula of type n*f(n)+g(n) unless we know k2 and k3.\nAlso, check list:\nk7=76, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, k12=2683.\nMaybe there is more: It's not clear.\n\nPerhaps the question means: \"Suppose that for some keys, the formula is k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). Determine what f(n) equals when it divides evenly.\" So answer: \nFor n=8, f(8)=28\nfor n=11, f(11)=105.\nMaybe there are others where f(n) is an integer, perhaps k2 and k3 might also satisfy that pattern. But we don't have their values.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the sequence \"k_n\" follows a recurrence like: \nk_1 = ? maybe k1= something? They mention k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. So maybe k2 and k3 are primes or something.\nI wonder if these keys might be numbers in a multiplication table puzzle.\n\nAnother angle: The pattern \"INDEX PRODUCT\" might indicate that some k_n is equal to the product of two previous keys, with indices adding up to n+? For instance, k5 = k2 * k3. Then maybe k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (or maybe k12 = k8\u00d7 something?) \nWait: \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" is given explicitly.\n\nMaybe these are from a puzzle called \"The Index Product Puzzle\". I recall a similar puzzle \"Clever use of indices\", but not sure.\n\nGiven what we have:\nWe want to calculate f(n) for each key. Possibly the answer: \nFor keys where k_n/n yields an integer, then f(n)= that quotient.\nSo computed examples:\nk7=76, so 76/7 \u224810.8571 (not integer).\nk8=224, so f(8)=224/8 = 28.\nk9=467, so 467/9 \u2260 integer.\nk11=1155, so f(11)=1155/11 =105.\nk12=2683, but note that k12 is given by an alternative formula: k8\u00d712 -5. That equals 224*12-5 = 2688-5=2683. So then if we divide k12 by 12 we get 223.58333, not integer.\n\nSo only keys with index 8 and 11 yield f(n) as an integer. Possibly also key k2 or k3 might? Let's check: maybe k2 = ? Not provided.\nWe have \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\", so that doesn't give a division by 5 necessarily.\n\nMaybe we can deduce something else:\n\"OBSERVED:\" line says \"- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\". Possibly they intended to say \"k5 does not equal the product of indices, but equals product of keys with indices 2 and 3\", which means there's a pattern: sometimes you get an index in the multiplier factor.\n\n\"CHECK:\" line shows: \n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 =10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8=28 (clean)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9=51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u21921155/11=105 (clean)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u21922683/12=223.58... but also k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo it seems that when the index appears in the formula, sometimes we see a clean division of key by index giving f(n). For n=8 and n=11, f(8)=28 and f(11)=105.\n\nMaybe pattern: f(n) might be given by triangular numbers. \nFor n=8, maybe f(8)=T_7 = 28.\nFor n=11, f(11)=T_{14}=105? But why would index 11 give triangular number of index 14?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(n) is determined by formula: f(n) = (n-1 choose something)? \n28 equals C(8,?) maybe not.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for some indices n, k_n/n is an integer and that integer is given by:\nFor n=8: f(8)=224/8=28.\nFor n=11: f(11)=1155/11=105.\nAnd for others like k7, k9, k12, the quotient is not integer.\n\nMaybe there are more keys that satisfy this property. Possibly also key 3 or 2 might? But we don't have their values.\n\nWait a minute: The question \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" likely expects an answer listing each key with its index and what f(key)= k_n/n if it divides evenly, otherwise maybe note that no such function exists (or it's not integer).\n\nLet's try to see if we can compute more keys from the given ones:\nWe have:\nk5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. So if I assume that perhaps k2 = 2\u00d7? but not sure.\n\nMaybe there is a known sequence: sometimes these puzzles come up in context of \"key numbers\" or \"magic keys\". The formula k_n = n * f(n) + g(n), where f and g are functions, might be part of a pattern analysis of such keys. The observation that sometimes the index appears in the formula means that for some keys, we have an expression like k_n = (f(n)) * n + remainder.\n\nMaybe I can say:\nFor key 2: Possibly if it is one of those keys where division gives integer quotient, then f(2)=? But not provided.\nWe might assume the sequence starts with k1 maybe?\nMaybe there's more context missing.\n\nThe question likely expects: \"Yes, for some keys (like k8 and k11), we have that k_n = n * T_{n-1} + something.\" But wait, T_7=28, T_{14}=105. And note that 7 is one less than 8? For k8, f(8)=T_7, and for k11, maybe it's T_10? No, T_10 would be 55, but we have 105 which is T_14. Perhaps the pattern: for even indices n, f(n) = T_{n-1}, and for odd indices maybe something else.\n\nLet\u2019s try to guess pattern from known numbers:\nFor k7, quotient approximates 76/7 \u224810.857, which is not triangular number.\nFor k8, quotient equals exactly 28, which is the 7th triangular number.\nFor k9, quotient approximates 51.89, no clear triangular number.\nFor k11, quotient equals 105, which is T_14? But wait, T_{14}=91 actually: Check triangular numbers: T_n = n(n+1)/2. For n=7, T_7=28; for n=8, T_8=36; for n=9, T_9=45; for n=10, T_10=55; for n=11, T_11=66; for n=12, T_12=78; for n=13, T_13=91; for n=14, T_14=105.\nSo 28 is T_7 and 105 is T_14. So maybe the pattern: f(8)=T_{7} and f(11)=T_{14}. The indices inside the triangular numbers are 7 and 14 respectively. They sum to 21 which is 3 times 7, or difference? Not sure.\n\nMaybe it's like f(n) = T_{something with n} when k_n/n yields an integer.\nFor n=8, maybe that something is (n+1)/? I'm thinking: For n=8, we got triangular number index 7. For n=11, we got triangular number index 14. That might be computed as: 2*(8) -9 = 7 and 3*(11)-19 = 14? That doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for indices where f(n) exists, it equals the triangular number corresponding to (n^2-?)/?.\n\nMaybe I can try to see differences: For k8, n=8 and f(8)=28. So f(8) - 8 =20. For k11, f(11)=105, so f(11)-11=94.\nNot clear.\n\nI need to re-read the problem statement carefully:\n\"INDEX PRODUCT\"\nMaybe it's a puzzle where each key is labeled with an index and sometimes equals a product of previous keys, sometimes plus something times the index. And we are asked: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly the answer will be a table:\n\nKey 2: f(2)=? (if applicable)\nKey 3: f(3)=? \n...\nThe given data points:\nk5 = k2 * k3,\nk7=76, so if expressed as k7 = ? * 7 + remainder then quotient is not integer.\nk8=224 gives quotient 28 exactly. So for key 8, f(8) = 28.\nk9=467 gives quotient approx 51.89\nk11=1155 gives quotient 105 exactly.\nk12=2683, but also equals k8\u00d712 -5.\n\nMaybe the answer is: \nFor key 2, if we assume it satisfies the relation k_n = n*f(n) + g(n), then f(2)=? But no info.\n\nMaybe there's a known sequence: Keys: 2,3,4,... Perhaps the keys are defined by the recurrence:\nk1= ?\nk2= ? \n...\nI might be missing context from an earlier part of the puzzle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can assume that the function f(n) is simply k_n/n when k_n is divisible by n. So then answer: f(8)=28 and f(11)=105. For other keys (like 7,9,12), k_n/n is not an integer so they don't have a well-defined f(n).\n\nMaybe the question expects: \"The only instances where we can express k_n in the form n*f(n) + g(n) with f(n) integral are when n=8 and n=11. In these cases, f(8)=28 and f(11)=105.\"\n\nBut then what about key 5? k5 = k2*k3, but no division by 5 is mentioned.\n\nMaybe the answer: \n- For key 7, dividing gives approximately 10.857, so it's not of that form.\n- For key 8, dividing yields 28 exactly, so f(8)=28.\n- For key 9, dividing yields approximately 51.89, so no.\n- For key 11, dividing yields 105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\n- For key 12, although not integral when divided by 12 (2683/12=223.583), we have the alternative expression k8\u00d712 -5.\n\nI might answer: \"The function f(n) can be computed as k_n/n for those keys where this division results in an integer. We find that:\nf(8)=224/8 = 28,\nf(11)=1155/11 =105.\nIt appears that when the index appears explicitly in the key formula, it is multiplied by a triangular number (since 28=7\u00d74 and 105=14\u00d77.5? Actually, 28 is T_7 and 105 is T_14).\"\n\nWait, check: Triangular numbers: 1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55,66,78,91,105,...\nSo indeed, 28 = T_7 and 105= T_{14}. So f(8)=T_7 and f(11)=T_{14}. Possibly the pattern is that for keys with even index n, f(n) = triangular number of (n-1), and for keys with odd index greater than a certain value, maybe f(n)= triangular number of something. But then 11 is odd, yet f(11)= T_{14}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's: if k_n can be expressed as n*f(n)+g(n) with f(n) integer, then f(n) turns out to be the triangular number corresponding to (n+?).\n\nMaybe I can try to see a relation between index and triangular index:\nFor key 8, triangular index = 7.\nFor key 11, triangular index = 14.\nThe ratio 7/8 is not obvious. But maybe it's: For even indices n, f(n)= T_{n-1}. For odd indices n greater than 5? Then for key 11 (odd) we would have T_{10} which equals 55, but that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is: if you can factor k_n as k_n = m*n + remainder, then f(n)=m. And the observed ones are 28 and 105. So answer: f(8)=28, f(11)=105.\nMaybe also check key 5: Could it be that k5/k5=1? That doesn't help.\n\nI suspect I need to provide a final answer listing each key (index) with its computed f(n) if applicable:\nKey 2: Not given explicitly.\nKey 3: Not given explicitly.\nKey 4: Possibly missing.\nKey 5: Given as product of keys 2 and 3, so no division by 5 is considered.\nKey 6: Not provided.\nKey 7: k7=76, so f(7)=76/7 \u224810.857 (not integer).\nKey 8: k8=224, so f(8)=28.\nKey 9: k9=467, so f(9) is not an integer.\nKey 10: Not provided.\nKey 11: k11=1155, so f(11)=105.\nKey 12: k12=2683, but since division yields non-integer, it's not of the form n*f(n)+g(n) with integer f(n).\n\nI think the intended answer is to note that sometimes the keys can be expressed as a product of the index and some function, and for indices 8 and 11 we have:\nf(8)=224/8=28 = T_7,\nf(11)=1155/11=105 = T_{14}.\n\nMaybe also f(n) in general is given by (n^2 + something)/? Not sure.\n\nI recall a similar puzzle \"Multiplicative Index Puzzle\" where the keys are:\nKey 1: 1\nKey 2: 2\nKey 3: 6\nKey 4: 12\nKey 5: 30\nKey 6: 60\nKey 7: 140\nKey 8: 224\nKey 9: 467 (maybe not)\nBut then k5= k2*k3 would be 2*6=12, but here k5 is supposed to equal product of keys 2 and 3. So maybe that sequence is different.\n\nWait, if k2=2 and k3=6, then k5 should be 12. But we are given k8=224 which is huge compared to 12. Maybe these are not consecutive integers but specific keys from a puzzle where the indices are arranged arbitrarily.\n\nI might need to assume that the only values for which f(n) (the quotient of k_n divided by n) is an integer are for key 8 and key 11, with f(8)=28 and f(11)=105. And maybe also note that key 12 can be expressed in terms of key 8.\n\nThus answer: \nFor key 7: f(7) = 76/7 \u2248 10.857 (not integer),\nfor key 8: f(8)=224/8=28,\nfor key 9: f(9)=467/9 \u2248 51.89 (not integer),\nfor key 11: f(11)=1155/11=105,\nand note that k12 = 2683 can also be written as 12*(223.5833) but more naturally as 224*12 - 5 = 2688-5.\n\nTherefore, the only keys for which the index cleanly factors are key 8 and key 11, with f(8)=28 and f(11)=105.\n\nThus final answer: \nf(2) is not defined by this method (or if k2 exists, it's trivial),\n...\nMaybe I'll simply say: \"The function f(n) for a key numbered n that can be expressed as n\u00b7f(n)+g(n) with integer f(n) is given by:\nFor n = 8: f(8)=28,\nFor n = 11: f(11)=105.\nIn other cases, k_n/n does not yield an integer.\"\n\nThat might be the answer.\n\nHowever, I worry that there's more context missing. Possibly the original puzzle had keys labeled with numbers and one had to determine a pattern in their factorization. The notation \"INDEX PRODUCT\" suggests that sometimes the product of two keys equals another key (like k5 = k2 * k3). And the idea is that for some keys, you can write them as (index)*[something] + remainder, where the something is f(n).\n\nMaybe I'll phrase it: \"Upon examination, we find that keys 7, 8, 9, and 11 yield quotients when divided by their indices. Specifically:\nk7 = 76 gives quotient 10.857... (not an integer),\nk8 = 224 gives quotient 28,\nk9 = 467 gives quotient approximately 51.89 (not an integer),\nk11 = 1155 gives quotient exactly 105.\nThus, the only keys for which f(n) is integral are k8 and k11, with f(8)=28 and f(11)=105.\"\n\nI can also note that 28 and 105 are triangular numbers: 28 = T7 and 105 = T14.\n\nMaybe I'll mention this observation as well.\n\nThus final answer.</think>We will show that in some of the \u201ckey\u2010products\u201d one may write a key K\u2099 in the form\n\n\u2003\u2003K\u2099 = n \u00b7 f(n) + g(n)\n\nwith f(n) an integer (and g(n) the \u201cleftover\u201d). In our puzzle the keys are numbered by their \u201cindex\u201d and sometimes one finds that a key is given as a product of two other keys. For example, we are told that\n\n\u2003\u2003K\u2085 = K\u2082 \u00b7 K\u2083.\n\nA closer look at several of the keys reveals that in some cases the index divides the key evenly so that f(n) turns out to be an integer. (In other cases the quotient is non\u2010integral.) In our list we have, for example,\n\n\u2003\u2003K\u2087 = 76,\u2003K\u2088 = 224,\u2003K\u2089 = 467,\u2003K\u2081\u2081 = 1155,\u2003and also\n\u2003\u2003K\u2081\u2082 = 2683\u2003(which may be written in \u201cmixed form\u201d as K\u2081\u2082 = 12\u00b7223 + 7 or even, since K\u2088 = 224, as K\u2081\u2082 = 224\u00b712 \u2013 5).\n\nLet us see what happens when we try to write the keys in the form\n\n\u2003\u2003K\u2099 = n \u00b7 f(n) + g(n).\n\nIn particular, if the quotient is an integer then f(n) is \u201cvisible.\u201d (One may think of f(n) as a sort of secondary \u201cindex\u2010function\u201d.) In our list we have:\n\n1. For key 7:\n\u2003\u2003K\u2087 = 76.\nDividing by 7 gives\n\u2003\u200376/7 \u2248 10.857\u2026 \nwhich is not an integer. (So in the form n\u00b7f(n)+g(n) the \u201cfactor\u201d f(7) would be non\u2010integral.)\n\n2. For key 8:\n\u2003\u2003K\u2088 = 224.\nDividing by 8 gives\n\u2003\u2003224/8 = 28 exactly.\nThat is, we may write\n\u2003\u2003K\u2088 = 8 \u00b7 28 + 0,\nso that in this case f(8) = 28.\n\n3. For key 9:\n\u2003\u2003K\u2089 = 467.\nDividing by 9 gives\n\u2003\u2003467/9 \u2248 51.89\u2026 \nwhich is not an integer. (Again, f(9) would be non\u2010integral.)\n\n4. For key 11:\n\u2003\u2003K\u2081\u2081 = 1155.\nDividing by 11 gives\n\u2003\u20031155/11 = 105 exactly.\nThat is,\n\u2003\u2003K\u2081\u2081 = 11 \u00b7 105 + 0,\nso that here f(11) = 105.\n\nAlso note that key 12 (which equals 2683) does not divide evenly by 12; however, it has the alternative representation\n\u2003\u2003K\u2081\u2082 = K\u2088 \u00b7 12 \u2013 5.\nThat is, even though 2683/12 is not an integer, one may \u201csee\u201d the number 224 (which is K\u2088) playing a role in its formation.\n\nA few observations:\n\u2022 In our list the only keys for which the division by the index gives an integer are K\u2088 and K\u2081\u2081.\n\u2022 Moreover, 28 = 8\u00b73.5 but more suggestively it is the 7th triangular number (since 1 + 2 + \u2026 + 7 = 28) and 105 is the 14th triangular number (because 1+2+\u2026+14 = 105).\n\u2003\u2003That is, f(8)=T\u2087 and f(11)=T\u2081\u2084.\n\nThus one acceptable answer to the question \u201cCalculate f(n) for each key\u201d is as follows:\n\n\u2013 For K\u2087: 76/7 \u2248 10.857\u2026 (so no integer factor f(7))\n\u2013 For K\u2088: 224/8 = 28\u2003\u2192\u2003f(8)=28\n\u2013 For K\u2089: 467/9 \u2248 51.89\u2026 (no integer factor)\n\u2013 For K\u2081\u2081: 1155/11 = 105\u2003\u2192\u2003f(11)=105\n\nAny answer which shows that when the index \u201cappears explicitly\u201d in a key\u2019s formula it is multiplied by an integer \u2013 here f(8)=28 and f(11)=105 (with these numbers being triangular numbers) \u2013 is correct.\n\nThis is one acceptable way to state the final answer.",
