  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence, which is like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}. The problem gives me the values for k7 = 76 and k8 = 224, and I have to see if there are integers a and b that satisfy those equations. Additionally, maybe there's a possibility of a constant term c, so I should also check that case too. \n\nFirst, let me tackle the first part without the constant c. The equations given are:\n\nFor k7 = 76: 76 = 49a + 21b  \nFor k8 = 224: 224 = 76a + 49b\n\nHmm, so I have two equations with two variables, a and b. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right. \n\nEquation 1: 49a + 21b = 76  \nEquation 2: 76a + 49b = 224  \n\nI need to solve for a and b. Let me think about how to do this. Since both equations are linear, I can use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is better here because the coefficients aren't too big. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let me try to eliminate one of the variables. Let's try to eliminate a first. To do that, I can multiply the first equation by 76 and the second equation by 49 so that the coefficients of a in both equations will be the same. Wait, that might be messy. Alternatively, maybe find the ratio?\n\nAlternatively, maybe rearrange one equation to express a in terms of b, then substitute. Let me try that.\n\nFrom equation 1:  \n49a = 76 - 21b  \nSo, a = (76 - 21b)/49\n\nHmm, then plug that into equation 2:\n\n76*( (76 -21b)/49 ) +49b = 224\n\nThat's a bit complicated, but let's compute step by step. Let me compute the first term:\n\n76*(76 -21b)/49 = (76*76 -76*21b)/49  \n76*76 is 5776, and 76*21 is 1596, so that becomes (5776 - 1596b)/49  \nThen adding 49b:  \n(5776 -1596b)/49 +49b =224\n\nLet me combine the terms. Let me write 49b as (49b *49)/49 to have a common denominator. Wait, that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, multiply both sides by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49b*49 = 224*49\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 76*76 = 5776  \nSecond term: 76*(-21b) = -1596b  \nThird term: 49b*49 = 2401b  \nFourth term: 224*49. Let me compute that. 224*50 would be 11200, so subtract 224 gives 11200 -224 = 10976\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b = 10976  \nCombine like terms:\n\n(-1596b +2401b) = 805b  \nSo 5776 +805b =10976  \nSubtract 5776 from both sides:\n\n805b = 10976 -5776  \nCalculate 10976-5776: 5200?\n\nWait, 10976 minus 5000 is 5976, then minus 776 more is 5976-776=5200. Yes. \n\nSo 805b =5200  \nThen b =5200 /805. Let me compute that. Let's see if this reduces. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5 first: 5200/5=1040, 805/5=161. So 1040/161. Hmm, 161 times 6 is 966, 1040 -966=74. So 6 and 74/161. \n\nHmm, that's a fraction. But we were supposed to find integer a and b. Since this is not an integer, that suggests that maybe there are no integer solutions for a and b. Hmm, so maybe the recurrence without a constant term doesn't hold?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check my steps again.\n\nStarting from substitution:\n\nFrom equation1: a=(76 -21b)/49\n\nThen plug into equation2:\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nSo replacing a:\n\n76*(76 -21b)/49 +49b =224\n\nMultiply through by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49b*49 =224*49\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nCalculating 76*76 is 5776, correct. 76*(-21b)= -1596b, yes. 49b*49=2401b, yes. 224*49: Let me check again. 224*49:\n\n224*50=11200, minus 224 gives 11200-224=10976, correct.\n\nSo 5776 -1596b +2401b =10976  \nSo 5776 + (2401-1596)b =10976  \n2401-1596: Let's see, 2400-1600=800, so 2401-1596=805, yes. So 805b =10976-5776=5200  \nSo 805b=5200  \nThen b=5200/805. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 5: 5200/5=1040, 805/5=161, so 1040/161. Let me see if 161 divides into 1040.\n\n161*6=966, 1040-966=74. 161*0.46 approximately? Not an integer. So indeed, fractional. So this suggests that there are no integer a and b. \n\nHmm, so maybe the problem is looking for non-integer a and b? But the question says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So if they have to be integers, then the answer is no. But maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, the problem states \"For k7 =76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721. For k8=224: 224 =a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\". So that is correct, assuming that k6 is 21 and k5 is something? Wait, actually, hold on, perhaps the indices are off?\n\nWait a second. The problem mentions \"k7 = 76\" and \"k8 =224\". But to form the equations, they used k_{n-1} and k_{n-2}. So for k7, the previous terms would be k6 and k5? Wait, but in the equations they have 49 and 21. So maybe k6=49 and k5=21? So the user is assuming that? Hmm, but maybe the actual sequence prior to k7 is given? The user might have some previous terms. Wait, but since the problem is presented as \"TEST: Can we find a, b...\", it's possible that the prior terms (k6 and k5) are given as 49 and 21 respectively? Because otherwise, we can't form the equations.\n\nWait, actually, the user hasn't provided the prior terms, but in their equations, they wrote:\n\nFor k7 =76: 76= a\u00d749 + b\u00d721  \nSo that implies that k6 is 49 and k5 is 21? So they must have assumed that? So the problem is presented with some prior terms? Maybe the user is following a sequence where previous terms are known. Since the problem is to test whether the recurrence holds for k7 and k8, given those terms, then the prior terms must be known. Since in the equations, they used 49 and 21 as the previous terms, so perhaps k6=49 and k5=21?\n\nTherefore, with that assumption, the equations are set up correctly. But solving them gives non-integer coefficients, so if we require integers, then no solution. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made an error in transcribing the problem? Let me see. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, 76a +49b =224 and 49a +21b=76. Let me try another method, like elimination. Let me try to multiply the first equation by 76 and the second by 49, but maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to write the equations as:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b =76  \nEquation2:76a +49b =224  \n\nLet me multiply Equation1 by 76 and Equation2 by 49, then subtract? Hmm, that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the determinant of the system to see if there's a solution. The system is:\n\n49a +21b =76  \n76a +49b =224  \n\nThe determinant of the coefficient matrix is (49)(49) - (21)(76). Let me calculate that:\n\n49*49 = 2401  \n21*76 = 1596  \nSo determinant is 2401 -1596 = 805.\n\nSince determinant is not zero, there is a unique solution. Which would be:\n\na = (76*49 - 21*224)/805  \nWait, using Cramer's rule:\n\na = ( determinant with first column replaced by constants ) divided by determinant.\n\nSo:\n\na = | 76   21 |  \n    |224   49 |  \ndivided by 805\n\nWhich is (76*49 -21*224)/805\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n76*49: 76*50=3800 minus 76=3724  \n21*224: 21*(200+24)=4200 +504=4704  \nSo numerator is 3724 -4704 = -980\n\nThus a= -980 /805. Simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: -196 /161\n\nSimilarly, b would be:\n\nb = |49  76 |  \n     |76 224|  \ndivided by 805\n\nCompute determinant: 49*224 -76*76\n\n49*224: 49*(200+24)=9800 +1176=10976  \n76*76=5776  \nSo determinant is 10976 -5776 =5200  \nThus b=5200/805= same as before, 1040/161\u22486.46\n\nSo indeed, a is -196/161 and b is 1040/161. These are fractions. So unless they allow fractional coefficients, there are no integer solutions. \n\nTherefore, if the problem requires integer a and b, then the answer is no, there's no such recurrence. \n\nBut the problem says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So probably the answer is no. But let me check if maybe I made an arithmetic mistake. Let me recalculate the determinant and the numerators again.\n\nFirst, determinant of coefficients: 49*49 -21*76  \n49*49 is 2401, 21*76=1596. 2401-1596=805, that's correct.\n\nFor a:\n\nNumerator: 76*49 -21*224  \n76*49: Let me do 70*49 +6*49 = 3430 +294= 3724  \n21*224: 20*224 +1*224=4480+224=4704  \n3724-4704= -980. So a is -980/805. Divide numerator and denominator by 5: -196/161. Correct.\n\nFor b:\n\nNumerator:49*224 -76*76  \n49*224: Let me compute 50*224=11200 minus 1*224=224, so 11200-224=10976  \n76*76=5776  \n10976-5776=5200. So 5200/805= same as before. \n\nSo indeed, the solution requires fractions. Therefore, no integer a and b satisfy the equations. \n\nHmm, so maybe the problem wants to know if such a recurrence exists with integer a and b, and the answer is no. But the user also mentioned \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\". So maybe with a constant term c? Let me try that case. \n\nSo now, the problem is to see if there's a recurrence of the form k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c, where a, b, c are integers. \n\nThen, for k7=76, we have:\n\n76 = a*k6 + b*k5 + c  \nWhich is 76 = a*49 + b*21 + c\n\nSimilarly, for k8=224:\n\n224 =a*k7 + b*k6 +c  \nWhich is 224 =a*76 + b*49 +c\n\nSo now we have two equations with three variables (a, b, c). To solve this, we need a third equation. But since we only have two terms (k7 and k8), unless there's another term given. Wait, maybe the user expects that the constant term c can be determined with just two equations? Since we have three variables, we can set up two equations but need another condition. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they assume that the recurrence holds for all previous terms as well, so perhaps we can use another term from earlier. But the problem only gives k7 and k8, and in the first case, uses k6 and k5 (49 and 21). If we can assume that the recurrence also holds for k6 and k5, then perhaps we can form another equation. Wait, but without knowing the earlier terms, we can't. Alternatively, maybe c is a constant, so if the recurrence holds for all n \u22653, then the constant c would be the same for all equations. \n\nWait, perhaps with the constant term, we can find a solution. Let me proceed with the two equations:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b +c =76  \nEquation2:76a +49b +c =224  \n\nLet me subtract equation1 from equation2 to eliminate c:\n\n(76a +49b +c) - (49a +21b +c) =224 -76  \nWhich gives:\n\n27a +28b =148  \n\nSo now, we have 27a +28b =148. Now, this is one equation with two variables (a and b), but we also have c to find. But we can express c from equation1:\n\nc =76 -49a -21b  \n\nSo if we can find integers a and b that satisfy 27a +28b =148, then c will be determined. \n\nSo let's solve 27a +28b =148 for integers a and b. \n\nWe can write this as 27a =148 -28b  \nThus, 27a \u2261148 mod28. Let me compute 148 mod28. Since 28*5=140, so 148-140=8. So 148\u22618 mod28. \n\nThus, 27a \u22618 mod28. \n\nWe can reduce 27 mod28 is -1, so -a \u22618 mod28 \u21d2 a \u2261-8 mod28 \u21d2a\u226120 mod28. \n\nSo a =28k +20 for some integer k. \n\nPlugging back into 27a +28b =148:\n\n27*(28k +20) +28b =148  \n27*28k +27*20 +28b =148  \nLet me compute 27*20=540, so:\n\n27*28k +540 +28b =148  \n28*(27k +b) =148 -540 = -392  \nThus,\n\n27k +b = -392 /28 = -14  \n\nHence, 27k +b= -14 \u21d2 b= -14 -27k  \n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na=28k +20  \nb= -14 -27k  \nc=76 -49a -21b  \n\nPlugging in a and b:\n\nc=76 -49*(28k +20) -21*(-14 -27k)  \nLet me compute each term:\n\n49*(28k +20)=49*28k +49*20=1372k +980  \n21*(-14 -27k)= -294 -567k  \n\nThus,\n\nc=76 - [1372k +980] - [ -294 -567k ]  \n=76 -1372k -980 +294 +567k  \nCombine like terms:\n\nConstants:76 -980 +294= (76+294)=370; 370-980= -610  \nVariables: (-1372k +567k)= -805k  \n\nThus, c= -610 -805k  \n\nTherefore, the solutions are parameterized by integer k as:\n\na=28k +20  \nb= -14 -27k  \nc= -805k -610  \n\nNow, we need to find integer k such that a, b, c are integers (which they are for any integer k), but perhaps we can find a small k that gives reasonable coefficients. Let's try k=0:\n\nk=0:  \na=20  \nb= -14  \nc= -610  \n\nThen check equation1: 49*20 +21*(-14) + (-610)=980 -294 -610=980-904=76, which matches.  \nEquation2:76*20 +49*(-14)+ (-610)=1520 -686 -610=1520-1296=224, which matches. \n\nSo with k=0, we have a=20, b=-14, c=-610. These are integers. \n\nAlternatively, trying k=1:\n\na=28+20=48  \nb= -14-27= -41  \nc= -805 -610= -1415  \n\nCheck equation1:49*48 +21*(-41) -1415=2352 -861 -1415= 2352 -2276=76, correct.  \nEquation2:76*48 +49*(-41) -1415=3648 -1989 -1415= 3648-3404=244? Wait, 3648-1989=1659; 1659-1415=244. But k8 is 224, so discrepancy here. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, if k=1, then c is -1415, so equation2 would be:\n\n76a +49b +c =76*48 +49*(-41) + (-1415)=  \n76*48=3648; 49*(-41)= -1989; 3648-1989=1659; 1659-1415=244, but it should be 224. Wait, that's a problem. \n\nWait a second, so my calculation must be wrong here. Wait, but when k=1, the equation2 is supposed to hold? Because the general solution should satisfy equation2. Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, in the general solution, the equations are constructed so that they should satisfy. Let me recalculate for k=1:\n\nc= -805*(1) -610= -805-610= -1415. \n\nThen equation2:76a +49b +c  \na=28*1 +20=48  \nb= -14-27*1= -41  \nThus 76*48=3648  \n49*(-41)= -1989  \nTotal:3648-1989=1659  \n1659 + (-1415)=1659-1415=244. \n\nBut equation2 should be 224. So discrepancy of 20. Hmm, that suggests an error in my general solution. Wait, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait let me check the steps again. \n\nWe had:\n\nAfter subtracting equation1 from equation2, we got 27a +28b =148. \n\nThen expressed a in terms of b modulo 28? Let me retrace.\n\nWe had equation:27a +28b =148  \n\nWe can write this as 27a =148 -28b  \nThen mod28: 27a \u2261148 mod28  \n\nEarlier, 148 mod28: 28*5=140, so 148-140=8, so 148\u22618 mod28. \n\n27 mod28 is -1, so equation becomes:\n\n- a \u22618 mod28 \u21d2a\u2261-8 mod28 \u21d2a\u226120 mod28. \n\nSo a=28k +20. \n\nThen substituting into 27a +28b=148:\n\n27*(28k +20)+28b=148  \n27*28k +27*20 +28b=148  \n27*28k=756k  \n27*20=540  \nThus, 756k +540 +28b=148  \nThen 28b=148 -540 -756k  \n28b= -392 -756k  \nDivide both sides by 28:  \nb= (-392/28) - (756/28)k  \n392/28=14, 756/28=27. So:\n\nb= -14 -27k. \n\nThus, that part is correct. \n\nThen c is from equation1:\n\nc=76 -49a -21b  \nSubstituting a=28k+20 and b= -14-27k:\n\nc=76 -49*(28k+20) -21*(-14-27k)  \n=76 - [49*28k + 49*20] - [ -21*14 -21*27k ]  \n=76 -49*28k -980 +294 +567k  \nSimplify constants:\n\n76 -980 +294 = (76+294)=370; 370-980= -610  \nVariables:\n\n-49*28k +567k = (-1372k) +567k = -805k  \n\nThus c= -610 -805k. Correct.\n\nThus, when k=1, c= -610 -805= -1415. \n\nNow equation2:76a +49b +c =76*(28+20) +49*(-41) + (-1415). Wait, but 28*1+20=48, so a=48. \n\nWait, but 76a =76*48=3648  \n49b=49*(-41)= -1989  \nc= -1415  \nTotal:3648 -1989 -1415=3648 - (1989 +1415)=3648 -3404=244. Which is not 224. \n\nHmm, so that suggests an error in the process? Wait, but when k=0 it works. Let me check for k= -1:\n\nk= -1:  \na=28*(-1)+20= -28+20= -8  \nb= -14 -27*(-1)= -14+27=13  \nc= -805*(-1) -610=805-610=195  \n\nCheck equation1:49*(-8) +21*(13) +195  \n49*(-8)= -392; 21*13=273; total: -392 +273 +195= (-392+273)= -119 +195=76. \n\nEquation2:76*(-8) +49*(13)+195  \n76*(-8)= -608; 49*13=637; total: -608 +637 +195= (29) +195=224. \n\nAh! So with k=-1, it works. \n\nSo for k=-1, we have: a= -8, b=13, c=195. \n\nSimilarly for k=0: a=20, b=-14, c=-610. \n\nBut when k=1, it's not working, but k=-1 works. \n\nWait, but why when k=1 it's not working? \n\nWait, equation2 is 224, but with k=1 it's 244. That's because when k=1, the solution is valid for equations 1 and 2? Or perhaps I made a mistake in thinking the general solution satisfies both equations. \n\nWait, since the general solution was derived from the two equations, so it should satisfy them for any k. Wait, but clearly for k=1, it's not. \n\nWait, let me check again for k=1:\n\na=28+20=48? No, k=1, so a=28*1 +20=48, correct. \n\nThen equation2:76a +49b +c =76*48 +49*(-41)+(-1415)=3648 -1989 -1415=3648 - (1989+1415)=3648-3404=244. \n\nWhich is different from 224. \n\nBut according to the derivation, these expressions should satisfy both equations. \n\nWait, perhaps there was an error in the algebra when substituting back. Let me re-express the general solution:\n\nWe had from equation2:\n\n27a +28b =148, which is derived from equation2 - equation1. \n\nThus, the solutions must satisfy both equations. \n\nWait, but when we parameterized in terms of k, then c is expressed in terms of k such that equation1 is satisfied. Since equation2 is the equation we used to derive the relation between a and b, and c is defined through equation1, so when we plug into equation2, it should hold. \n\nWait let me recalculate with k=1:\n\nc= -610 -805*1= -1415. \n\nThen equation2:76a +49b +c=76*(28+20) +49*(-14-27*1) + (-1415)  \n=76*48 +49*(-41) -1415  \n= 3648 - 1989 -1415  \n3648-1989=1659  \n1659-1415=244. \n\nHmm, discrepancy. \n\nWait, but equation2 is supposed to be 224. \n\nWait, maybe I made an error when setting up the equations. Let me check the equations again:\n\nThe original equations are:\n\nequation1:49a +21b +c=76  \nequation2:76a +49b +c=224  \n\nSubtract equation1 from equation2: (76a -49a) + (49b -21b) + (c -c)=224-76  \n27a +28b =148. Which is correct. \n\nThus, the equations are correct. \n\nThen the general solution is correct. \n\nBut when I plug in k=1, which gives a=48, b=-41, c=-1415, into equation2:\n\n76a +49b +c=76*48 +49*(-41) + (-1415)=3648 -1989 -1415=244. \n\nWhich is not 224. \n\nThus, there must be an error in the derivation. \n\nWait, but when I plug in k=-1:\n\na=-8, b=13, c=195. \n\nThen equation2:76*(-8) +49*(13)+195= -608 +637 +195= (29)+195=224. Correct. \n\nFor k=0: a=20, b=-14, c=-610. \n\nEquation2:76*20 +49*(-14) + (-610)=1520-686-610=1520-1296=224. Correct. \n\nSo for k=0 and k=-1, it works, but for k=1 it doesn't. \n\nAh! Wait, maybe the mistake is that in the equation 27a +28b=148, when we solve for a and b, there are constraints beyond just the modulo. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the parameterization is correct but the equation2 is only satisfied when the parameters are chosen such that the substitution holds. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the error comes from the step where I divided by 28. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nAfter 27a +28b =148, \n\nwe have 28b =148 -27a. \n\nThen to solve for integer solutions, we can express this as a Diophantine equation. \n\nThe general solution can be found by finding one particular solution and then adding the homogeneous solution. \n\nLet me try another approach. \n\nLet me find integer solutions to 27a +28b =148. \n\nLet me solve for b: \n\n28b=148-27a \u21d2b=(148-27a)/28. \n\nTo have b integer, 148-27a must be divisible by28. \n\nLet me write 148 -27a \u22610 mod28 \u21d2-27a \u2261-148 mod28 \u21d227a \u2261148 mod28. \n\nAs before, 148 mod28=8, so 27a\u22618 mod28. \n\nSince 27\u2261-1 mod28, so -a\u22618 mod28 \u21d2a\u2261-8 mod28 \u21d2a\u226120 mod28. \n\nThus, a=28k +20 for some integer k. \n\nThen b=(148 -27*(28k +20))/28  \n= (148 -756k -540)/28  \n=(148-540 -756k)/28  \n=(-392 -756k)/28  \n= (-392/28) - (756/28)k  \n= -14 -27k. \n\nThus, same as before. \n\nThen c is determined via equation1:49a +21b +c=76 \u21d2 c=76 -49a -21b. \n\nThus, substituting a=28k+20 and b= -14 -27k: \n\nc=76 -49*(28k+20) -21*(-14 -27k)  \n=76 -1372k -980 +294 +567k  \n= (76 -980 +294) + (-1372k +567k)  \n= (76 - 686) + (-805k)  \n= -610 -805k. \n\nThus, c= -805k -610. \n\nThus, the parameterization is correct. \n\nNow, for equation2:76a +49b +c should equal 224. \n\nLet me compute 76a +49b +c: \n\n76*(28k+20) +49*(-14 -27k) + (-805k -610)  \n=76*28k + 76*20 +49*(-14) +49*(-27k) -805k -610  \n= (76*28k -49*27k -805k) + (76*20 -49*14 -610)  \n\nCompute coefficients of k: \n\n76*28 = 2128  \n49*27=1323  \nThus, 2128k -1323k -805k = (2128 -1323 -805)k = (2128 -2128)k=0k. \n\nConstant terms: \n\n76*20=1520  \n49*14=686  \nThus, 1520 -686 -610 = (1520 -686)=834; 834 -610=224. \n\nThus, the total is 0k +224=224. \n\nThus, the equation2 is indeed satisfied for any k. \n\nWait, but when I plug in k=1 I got 244. But according to this calculation, it should be 224. \n\nWait, there must be an arithmetic mistake. \n\nWait let's compute with k=1: \n\n76a +49b +c =76*(28*1+20) +49*(-14-27*1) + (-805*1 -610)  \n=76*(48) +49*(-41) + (-1415)  \n=3648 + (-1989) + (-1415)  \n=3648 -1989 =1659; 1659-1415=244. \n\nBut according to the symbolic calculation, it should be 224. \n\nThis discrepancy must be because in the symbolic calculation, the coefficients of k canceled out, but in the actual substitution with k=1, they didn't. \n\nWait, in the symbolic calculation:\n\n76a +49b +c =76*(28k+20) +49*(-14 -27k) + (-805k -610)  \n=76*28k +76*20 +49*(-14) +49*(-27k) + (-805k) -610  \n= (76*28k -49*27k -805k) + (76*20 -49*14 -610)  \n\nWait, in the term with k:  \n76*28k is 2128k  \n49*(-27k) is -1323k  \n-805k is -805k  \nTotal: 2128k -1323k -805k = (2128 - (1323 +805))k  \n2128 -2128=0. \n\nYes, so the coefficients of k indeed cancel. \n\nThus, the total is 224 for any k. \n\nBut in my substitution with k=1, I must have made a mistake. \n\nWait let's compute again for k=1:\n\na=28*1 +20=48  \nb= -14 -27*1= -41  \nc= -805*1 -610= -1415  \n\nSo equation2 is:  \n76a =76*48=3648  \n49b=49*(-41)= -1989  \nc= -1415  \nTotal:3648 -1989 -1415=3648 - (1989+1415)=3648 -3404=244. \n\nBut according to the symbolic calculation, this should be 224. \n\nWait, I think there's a miscalculation here. Let me compute 1989 +1415: \n\n1989 +1415: \n\n1989 +1400=3389, then +15=3404. \n\n3648 -3404=244. \n\nHmm, so discrepancy remains. \n\nWait, but according to symbolic calculation, equation2=224. \n\nWait, but 76a +49b +c=224 for any k? That can't be true unless coefficients of k cancel. \n\nWait, but according to the symbolic steps:\n\n76a +49b +c=224 for any k. \n\nBut with numbers, for k=1 it gives 244, which is different. \n\nThere must be an error in the symbolic calculation. \n\nWait let me re-express equation2 with the expressions for a,b,c in terms of k. \n\nGiven a=28k+20, b= -14-27k, c= -805k -610. \n\nThen equation2:76a +49b +c=76*(28k+20)+49*(-14-27k)+(-805k-610). \n\nLet me compute term by term: \n\nFirst term:76*(28k+20)=76*28k +76*20=2128k+1520  \nSecond term:49*(-14 -27k)=49*(-14) +49*(-27k)= -686 -1323k  \nThird term: -805k -610  \n\nAdd all together: \n\n2128k +1520 -686 -1323k -805k -610  \n\nCombine like terms: \n\nFor k terms:2128k -1323k -805k = (2128 - (1323 +805))k = (2128 -2128)k=0k  \nConstants:1520 -686 -610 = (1520 -686)=834; 834-610=224. \n\nThus total equation2=224. \n\nTherefore, when substituting k=1, the result must be 224, but my arithmetic earlier was wrong. \n\nWait, let's recalculate for k=1: \n\n76a=76*48=3648  \n49b=49*(-41)= -1989  \nc= -1415  \n\n3648 + (-1989) = 3648 -1989 = 1659  \n1659 + (-1415) = 1659 -1415=244. \n\nWait, but according to symbolic it should be 224. \n\nWait, 76a +49b +c=224. \n\nWait, where is the mistake? \n\nWait, c= -805k -610. For k=1, c= -805 -610= -1415. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nWait, 76a +49b +c=76*(28k+20) +49*(-14-27k)+ (-805k-610)=224. \n\nWait, but when substituting k=1, the terms are: \n\n76a=76*(48)=3648  \n49b=49*(-41)= -1989  \nc= -1415  \n\nSum: 3648 -1989 -1415=3648 - (1989 +1415)=3648 - 3404=244. \n\nBut symbolic says it should be 224. \n\nHmm, there must be an error in the symbolic calculation. \n\nWait wait: in the expression for c: \n\nc= -805k -610. \n\nWait, let me re-examine the derivation of c. \n\nFrom equation1:49a +21b +c=76. \n\nWait, no, the original equation was probably different. Let me check the equations again. \n\nWait the problem says: \n\nOriginal equations?
