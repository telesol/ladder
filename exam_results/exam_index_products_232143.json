It seems we have keys: maybe they are \"k2, k3, k5, ...\" Some numbers provided in question:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\n- k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 equals 224/8=28, so that implies k8 = 224? Actually note: They said: \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" then it says \"224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\" Wait check: if k8 = f(n)*n + g(n) for n=8 then maybe they did: (f(8)*8+g(8)) = k8, and dividing by 8 gives something. They computed 224/8 = 28, so that means f(8)*? It might be that the quotient is integer if we do k_n / n equals some function of n.\n\nObservations: The pattern seems to propose that sometimes the index itself appears in the formula. So maybe for keys whose indices are composite (or primes?), or for certain numbers like 8,11,12, etc., a linear relationship holds: k_n = f(n) * n + g(n).\n\nFrom given: \nFor k8, we have \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" and they computed: 224/8=28 = k8/8. So maybe k8 = 224, and then dividing by 8 gives f(8)=28? But then the phrase \"f(n) for each key\" might indicate that we want to compute the factor f(n) from these keys, which is given by dividing k_n by n if it divides evenly.\n\nThe hypothesis: sometimes k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). Then f(n) should be (k_n - g(n))/n. But without knowing what g(n) is, we can only compute f(n) when the remainder doesn't exist, i.e., when k_n/n is an integer. They observed that for n=8: 224/8 = 28, so f(8)=28. For n=11: 1155/11=105, so f(11)=105. And then for n=12: k12 is computed as (k8\u00d712-5). But they then compute \"2683/12\", which is not an integer.\n\nThen the question: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" They want to find a formula for f(n)? Or list values? Possibly we have keys indexed: 2,3,7,8,9,11,12. Given: \n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (maybe that means k2 and k3 exist, so maybe they are given or computed from other keys). But then we have \"k8\" is apparently an integer multiple of 8 plus something.\n\nMaybe the pattern is: sometimes k_n can be represented as f(n)*n + g(n) where f(n) might be computed by dividing k_n by n if that division yields an integer result.\n\nThey check:\n- For k7, it's not clean: 76/7 ~ 10.86\n- For k8, 224/8=28 is integer.\n- For k9, 467/9 ~ 51.89, not integer.\n- For k11, 1155/11 =105 exactly.\n\nMaybe the keys are defined as:\nk2, k3: maybe from something like earlier indices, but then they use them to compute k5 and so on?\n\nI recall a known problem \"Index Product Pattern Analysis\" might be referencing a sequence where each key is computed by some formula that involves previous keys. But I'm not sure what the actual sequence is.\n\nThe observed pattern is: For some n, k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), but for others it's not so neat.\n\nGiven the check, they computed:\nk7 = 76 (maybe) because 76/7=10.86\nk8 = 224, since 224/8=28 integer.\nk9 = 467,\nk11 = 1155,\nk12 = 2683? But wait, k12 equals \"k8\u00d712-5\", so that is 28*12 - 5 = 336 - 5 = 331? No, wait check: They wrote \"k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\", then they write: \"So k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\". And then \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nWait, re-read the text carefully:\n\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\nSo we have the following keys: \nk7, k8, k9, k11, k12.\nWe have computed values:\nk7 = 76,\nk8 = 224,\nk9 = 467,\nk11 = 1155,\nk12 = 2683. But note for k12 they mention a formula: k8\u00d712-5 which equals 28*12 - 5 = 336 - 5 = 331, but that doesn't match 2683; wait check: 28 * 12 = 336, minus 5 gives 331, not 2683. So maybe I misinterpret: \"k8\u00d712-5\" might mean \"k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\", where k8 is something else than 224? Let's re-read that line: \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". So if k8\u00d712-5 equals 2683, then k8 must be (2683+5)/12 = 2688/12 = 224 exactly. Yes, that works: 2688/12 = 224. So indeed k8 is 224.\n\nThen they conclude: \"So k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\". That means f(8)=28 and f(11)=105.\n\nAnd then question: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nIt might be that the answer is:\nFor n=2,3,... etc. But we only have explicit values for some keys: For instance, they computed:\nk7 = ? but apparently 76/7 \u2260 integer, so then maybe f(7)=floor division? But the hypothesis says \"Sometimes the index appears in the formula\", that means sometimes k_n can be expressed as something times n plus a constant.\n\nSo let's list:\n\n- k2: We haven't been given numeric value? Possibly from pattern, if k5 = k2 * k3, then maybe k2 and k3 are known keys. Perhaps they are computed from earlier indices? But the text only gives observed ones: k7=76, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, k12=2683.\nBut then also k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (but that doesn't give numbers unless we know k2 and k3). Perhaps there is an underlying sequence like the \"index product pattern\" known from a previous puzzle? Possibly it's related to keys of the form: k1= something, k2=something, etc.\n\nMaybe I should try to deduce f(n) for each key that can be represented as f(n)*n. And maybe if not integer, then we don't have a pattern?\n\nThe observed ones:\n- For n=7, k7=76, 76/7 = 10.857... so it's not an integer multiple.\n- For n=8, k8=224, division gives 28 exactly; f(8)=28.\n- For n=9, k9=467, division gives ~51.888...\n- For n=11, k11=1155, division yields 105 exactly; so f(11)=105.\n- For n=12, k12=2683, but if we try to write it as something times 12 plus constant maybe? They propose representation: \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\". But in the check they say: \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58...\". So that doesn't cleanly divide.\n\nWait, let me re-read step 5 carefully: \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\" Wait, what does that mean? It might be interpreted as: If we assume a pattern of the form k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then for n=12 maybe they try to compute f(12)=2683/12 if g(12) were 0. But it's not an integer (223.58...). However, note that there is another expression: \"k8\u00d712-5\", and since k8=224, we get 224*12 -5 = 2688 -5 = 2683, so that fits. So for n=12, the pattern might be expressed in terms of a previous key times the index minus something.\n\nWait, maybe what they mean is: sometimes instead of a representation with f(n) and g(n), you can represent k_n as a combination of other keys with coefficients involving the index. For example, k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3, and k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5. And then the hypothesis \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\" So maybe for some n, f(n) is not simply k_n/n but rather computed from a previous key.\n\nSo the question: \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" might be asking to compute these factors f(n) that are extracted when expressing k_n in the form f(n)*n + g(n), where f(n) should be an integer if possible. And we have examples:\nFor n=7, is there any factor? It doesn't divide evenly.\nFor n=8, dividing gives 224/8 = 28, so f(8)=28.\nFor n=9, 467/9 is not an integer; maybe the pattern would be k9 = 51*9 + something? Because 51*9=459, then remainder 8. So maybe g(9) would be 8.\nFor n=11, 1155/11=105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\nFor n=12, if we try a similar division: 2683/12 is not an integer; but note that k12 can also be written as 224*12 - 5 (since k8=224), which suggests maybe f(12) = k8? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait let me re-read the given expressions:\n\nThe check list shows:\n1. \"k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\"\n2. \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713\"\n3. \"k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\"\n4. \"k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\"\n5. \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\n\nSo they are trying to express each key as a product of some number with the index plus possibly an offset g(n). They denote that expression as f(n)*n + g(n).\n\nThey have observed that for n=8, we get an integer factor 28, and for n=11, we get 105. But for others like n=7,9,12 it doesn't yield a neat product representation with f(n) being a whole number if we just do k_n/n.\n\nMaybe the pattern is: f(2)=?; f(3)=?; f(5)=? etc. They mention \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" which implies that for n=5, the factor might be k2 * something or maybe a product of previous keys. But then the hypothesis is \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\" That suggests that if we try to write it as f(n)*n + g(n), sometimes the multiplier f(n) might equal one of the earlier f-values.\n\nI suspect there's a known sequence: k2, k3, k5, etc. Possibly these are keys from some cryptographic puzzle? But likely not necessary.\n\nPerhaps I should assume that the keys follow a pattern where for some indices n (like prime numbers or composite ones), we have k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). And then computing f(n) means dividing by n when it divides evenly, i.e., if k_n mod n == 0 then f(n)=k_n/n. For keys where it doesn't divide evenly, maybe one can subtract an offset that is given by a combination of previous keys.\n\nThe question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" suggests: For the keys in the observed list (n=7,8,9,11,12), what are the corresponding values of f(n)? And we see from the check:\n- For n=7, if we try to write it as something times 7 plus a remainder, that something would be floor(76/7)=10 with remainder 6. But then is that f(7)? Possibly not.\nBut maybe they want: f(7) = 76/7? That doesn't seem to be the answer because it's not an integer.\n\nMaybe I should re-read the check list more carefully:\n\n\"CHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\"\nThis might be read as: If we assume a representation k7 = f(7)*7 + g(7), then what would f(7) be if the remainder were zero? But it's not an integer.\n\n\"2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713\"\nThis indicates that for n=8, k8 divided by 8 gives 28 exactly; so f(8)=28.\n\"3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\"\nSo f(9) would be approximately 51.89, but not an integer.\n\"4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\"\nSo f(11)=105.\n\"5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\nThis one is tricky: If we try to represent k12 as something times 12 plus something, dividing gives 223 remainder? But if we express it in terms of k8 and the index 12 with a subtraction of 5, that might be equivalent to f(12) = k8 - (5/12)? That doesn't match the pattern.\n\nMaybe there is a misprint: \"k8\u00d712-5\" might actually mean \"k8 times 12 minus something\", but then equals 2683. Let's check: If k8=224, then 224*12 = 2688; subtracting 5 gives 2683. So that representation is valid for k12.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is not simply k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), but rather sometimes we can write k_n in terms of previous keys and the index n. For example, k5 = k2 * k3, and k12 = k8 * 12 - 5.\nThen perhaps the question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" means: Find a formula that expresses f(n) in these cases.\n\nMaybe I can hypothesize that:\n- f(7)=? Possibly is computed as something like: f(7)= (k9 + ?)/9? Not sure.\nAlternatively, maybe we are asked to extract the factor from the representation \"f(n)*n\" when such a clean division is possible. That yields: for n=8, f(8)=28 and for n=11, f(11)=105.\n\nFor the others (7,9,12), they did not yield an integer factor f(n). But maybe we can still compute them as fractions:\nf(7) = 76/7 \u2248 10.8571,\nf(9) = 467/9 \u2248 51.8889,\nand for n=12, if we assume the representation k_n = f(12)*12 + g(12), then f(12)=2683/12 = 223.58333... But that doesn't yield a neat pattern.\n\nMaybe the intended answer is: \nf(2) might be something, f(3) might be something, f(5)= k2*k3? That is not of the form f(n)*n though.\nAlternatively, maybe the keys come from a known sequence like \"index product keys\" from the \"Index Product Puzzle\".\n\nI recall a puzzle sometimes referred to as \"The index-product puzzle\", where each key k_n satisfies a certain equation involving its index n. Possibly it's something like: For composite indices, k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) where f(n) is the product of earlier keys corresponding to factors of n? Wait, let me try that idea:\n\nMaybe if n has factors, then k_n might equal the product of some other keys. For instance, n=5 is prime though; but they gave k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 which are factors 2 and 3. And for n=12 (which factors as 3*4 or 2*6) they used k8 * 12 - 5? That doesn't match.\n\nAnother possibility: The keys might be defined recursively by something like:\nk_n = f(n)*n + g(n), where f(n) is determined by a recurrence relation involving previous keys. For instance, maybe f(7) is computed from earlier ones somehow.\nWe have k8=224 and k11=1155. Notice that 28 * 8 = 224, and 105*11 = 1155. And 105/28 = 3.75 approximately (actually 105/28 = 3.75 exactly). And maybe there's a pattern in these multipliers: f(2) might be something, f(3) might be something, then f(5)=? But we haven't been given k2 and k3 explicitly.\n\nMaybe the sequence is:\nk1 = ?\nk2 = ?\nk3 = ?\nk4 = ?\nk5 = k2 * k3,\nk6 = ?,\nk7 = 76,\nk8 = 224,\nk9 = 467,\nk10 = ?,\nk11 = 1155,\nk12 = 2683.\n\nMaybe I can try to guess f(n) for n=7,8,9,11,12 if we assume the representation is k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), and maybe g(n) should be a constant or something that follows its own pattern. Possibly g(n)=? For n=8, 224 = 28*8, so g(8)=0.\nFor n=11, 1155 = 105 * 11, so g(11)=0.\nSo for indices where the division is exact, f(n) equals k_n / n.\n\nNow what about others? For n=7: 76 divided by 7 gives remainder 6 because 10*7=70 and 76-70=6, so maybe g(7)=6. So then f(7)=10 (if we take the quotient).\nFor n=9: 467 divided by 9 gives quotient 51 and remainder 8 (since 51*9=459, remainder 8), so f(9)=51.\nFor n=12: 2683 divided by 12 gives quotient 223 with remainder? 223*12 = 2676, remainder is 7. So maybe g(12)=7 and f(12)=223.\n\nLet's check if that pattern holds: For n=8, quotient=28, remainder=0; for n=11, quotient=105, remainder=0; for n=7, quotient=10, remainder=6; for n=9, quotient=51, remainder=8; for n=12, quotient=223, remainder=7.\nAnd then what about k5? If we try to compute that: k5 is given as k2 * k3. We don't know k2 and k3 numbers though.\n\nMaybe the pattern f(n) = floor(k_n/n). But that doesn't look like a neat pattern either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(n) should be computed from the representation \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\" where g(n) is chosen such that if the index divides k_n then g(n)=0, and otherwise some constant offset is added. Then we have:\nf(7)=10 (if 76=10*7+6),\nf(8)=28 (224=28*8+0),\nf(9)=51 (467=51*9+8),\nf(11)=105 (1155=105*11+0),\nf(12)=223 (2683=223*12+7).\n\nMaybe the pattern is that when n is prime, g(n) might be nonzero sometimes? For 7 and 11, we got remainders of 6 and 0 respectively. And for composite n=8,9,12, remainders are 0,8,7 respectively.\n\nI wonder if these numbers (10,28,51,105,223) themselves follow a pattern:\n- f(7)=10\n- f(8)=28\n- f(9)=51\n- f(11)=105\n- f(12)=223\n\nMaybe there's some recurrence: 10 to 28 is +18; 28 to 51 is +23; then jump to 105 for n=11, but n=11 is out of order. Let me re-order by increasing n:\nFor n=7: f(7)=? we computed quotient = 76/7 gives 10 remainder 6.\nFor n=8: f(8)=28.\nFor n=9: f(9)=51.\nThen next prime index after 9 is 11, so f(11)=105.\nAnd then n=12 (composite) f(12)=223.\n\nNow maybe there's a pattern like f(n) = previous f(n-1) + something? For instance, from 7 to 8: increase of 18; from 8 to 9: increase of 23; from 9 to 11: increase of 54 (but skip n=10); then from 11 to 12: increase of 118. Not obvious.\n\nMaybe the intended answer is just \"f(n) = k_n/n\", but that doesn't work for ones where division is not exact.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the idea is that when we write k_n in the form f(n)*n + g(n), then sometimes g(n)=0 (for n=8 and 11), and other times it's a fixed offset. And these offsets might be related to differences between prime factors or something similar.\n\nMaybe I can try to derive formulas: For n=7, k_7 = 76, so f(7) = (k_7 - g(7))/7. But what is g(7)? It could be chosen to make f(n) an integer if possible. They already did that for n=8 and 11 where the remainder was zero.\n\nMaybe the puzzle is known: \"Index Product Puzzle\" or something like that, where each key k_n satisfies a certain property with respect to its index. The equation might be something like:\nk_2 = ?,\nk_3 = ?,\nand then for n>=5, k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) with some recurrence relation.\n\nI might try to see if the remainders g(n) have any pattern: For n=7, g(7)=76 - 10*7 = 6; for n=8, g(8)=0; for n=9, g(9)=467 - 51*9 = 8; for n=11, g(11)=1155 - 105*11 = 0; for n=12, g(12)=2683 - 223*12 = 7.\nMaybe these remainders correspond to the digits of some number? 6, 0, 8, 0, 7. Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(n) itself has a pattern: f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, f(12)=223.\nMaybe these can be seen as: 10 = 2*5, 28=4*7, 51=3*17, 105=7*15, 223 is prime. Not sure.\n\nI suspect that without additional context or a definition of k_n, it's hard to determine f(n) explicitly from the given numbers alone.\n\nMaybe I should re-read the problem statement: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" It might be part of a puzzle where you are given keys and need to find out which one is the odd one out based on the structure f(n)*n + g(n). Possibly the answer is simply:\nFor k_7, f(7)=10; for k_8, f(8)=28; for k_9, f(9)=51; for k_11, f(11)=105; and for k_12, f(12)=223.\nBut then what about k5? k5 is given as k2*k3, so maybe its factorization doesn't fit the form?\n\nMaybe there's a known sequence: 2, 3, 5*? Let me try to hypothesize: Maybe the keys are defined by:\nk_1 = ?\nk_2 = 4,\nk_3 = 9,\nk_4 = ?,\nk_5 = k_2*k_3 = 36,\nk_6 = ?,\nk_7 = 76,\nk_8 = 224,\nk_9 = 467,\nk_10 = ?,\nk_11 = 1155,\nk_12 = 2683.\nThen the representation might be: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) where sometimes f(n)=0, etc.\n\nI note that k8=224 is exactly 28*8. k11=1155 is 105*11. So maybe f(8)=28 and f(11)=105 are neat.\nThen for k7=76, if we try to express it as f(7)*7 + g(7), the natural choice would be f(7)=10 and remainder 6. For k9=467, quotient is 51 remainder 8. For k12=2683, quotient is 223 remainder 7.\n\nI wonder if the remainders correspond to something like: maybe g(n) = k_n mod n.\nFor n=7, 76 mod 7 = 76 - 70 = 6.\nFor n=8, 224 mod 8 = 0.\nFor n=9, 467 mod 9 = 467 - 459 = 8.\nFor n=11, 1155 mod 11 = 1155 - 1050 = 105? Wait, 105*11 = 1155 so remainder is 0.\nFor n=12, 2683 mod 12: 12*223 = 2676, remainder 7.\n\nSo indeed, f(n) is just the quotient when dividing k_n by n. So maybe that's what they want:\nf(7)=10,\nf(8)=28,\nf(9)=51,\nf(11)=105,\nf(12)=223.\nBut then how do we calculate these? They are just integer divisions: f(n) = floor(k_n/n)? But 76/7 is not an integer, but floor would be 10, and remainder 6. But the notation \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\" usually implies that f(n) and g(n) are uniquely determined integers with 0 \u2264 g(n) < n. In that case, for k_7=76, we have 76 = 10*7 + 6, so f(7)=10, g(7)=6.\nSimilarly, for k_9=467, 467 = 51*9 + 8, so f(9)=51, g(9)=8.\nFor k12=2683, 2683 = 223*12 + 7, so f(12)=223, g(12)=7.\n\nThen for the ones that divide evenly: k_8=224 gives 224=28*8+0 so f(8)=28, and k_11=1155 gives f(11)=105.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is simply: \nf(7) = 10,\nf(8) = 28,\nf(9) = 51,\nf(11) = 105,\nf(12) = 223.\nAnd if we need to include k_5, then k_5 = k_2 * k_3. But without the values of k_2 and k_3, we can't compute f(5).\n\nMaybe the problem expects: \nFor key n=5 (which is composite in a multiplicative way), its factorization doesn't follow the linear form f(n)*n + g(n) because it's defined as the product of two previous keys. So maybe for primes and certain composites, k_n has the representation k_n = f(n)*n + g(n).\n\nMaybe there is an underlying property: k_n \u2261 ? (mod n). We see that for n=7, 76 mod 7 =6; for n=8, 224 mod 8 =0; for n=9, 467 mod 9 =8; for n=11,1155 mod 11=0; for n=12,2683 mod 12=7.\nSo the remainders seem to be: 6, 0, 8, 0, 7. Perhaps these are related to something like (n-1) or maybe they correspond to digits of a telephone number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(n) is defined recursively by f(n) = k_n/n - some function of n. But we already computed those values from the given keys.\nSo I'm leaning towards the answer: \nf(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and f(12)=223.\n\nI want to double-check arithmetic:\n76 divided by 7: 7*10=70, remainder 6, so quotient =10.\n224/8 = 28 exactly.\n467/9: 9*51=459, remainder 8, so quotient =51.\n1155/11: 11*105=1155, remainder 0.\n2683/12: 12*223=2676, remainder 7.\n\nSo these are correct.\n\nMaybe the answer expected is \"f(n)=k_n div n\", i.e. integer division of k_n by n.\n\nThus final answer:\nFor n=7, f(7)=10; for n=8, f(8)=28; for n=9, f(9)=51; for n=11, f(11)=105; and for n=12, f(12)=223.\n\nThat is the most straightforward extraction from the given keys.\n\nI'll now produce final answer in plain text.</think>We will show that when a key k\u2099 (with index n) is written in the form\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n) \u00b7 n + g(n)\n\n(with 0 \u2264 g(n) < n so that f(n) and g(n) are uniquely determined), then for several of the keys one finds a \u201cnice\u201d value for f(n). (In other words, sometimes k\u2099 is an exact multiple of n so that g(n)=0.) In our list the keys\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2087 = 76,\u2003k\u2088 = 224,\u2003k\u2089 = 467,\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 1155,\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 2683\n\nare given and one may show that they can be written as follows:\n\n\u2022 For n = 7:\n\u2003\u200376 = 10\u00b77 + 6.\n\u2003\u2003Thus f(7) = 10 (with remainder g(7)=6).\n\n\u2022 For n = 8:\n\u2003\u2003224 = 28\u00b78 + 0.\n\u2003\u2003So f(8) = 28 (and here g(8)=0, i.e. k\u2088 is exactly divisible by 8).\n\n\u2022 For n = 9:\n\u2003\u2003467 = 51\u00b79 + 8.\n\u2003\u2003Thus f(9) = 51 (with remainder g(9)=8).\n\n\u2022 For n = 11:\n\u2003\u20031155 = 105\u00b711 + 0.\n\u2003\u2003So f(11) = 105 (again with no \u201cextra\u201d part since k\u2081\u2081 is an exact multiple of 11).\n\n\u2022 For n = 12:\n\u2003\u20032683 = 223\u00b712 + 7.\n\u2003\u2003Thus f(12) = 223 (with remainder g(12)=7).\n\nSo the answers are:\n\n\u2003\u2003f(7) = 10,\u2003f(8) = 28,\u2003f(9) = 51,\u2003f(11) = 105,\u2003f(12) = 223.\n\nNote:\nIn many puzzles of this type (sometimes called \u201ckey\u2010number\u201d or \u201cindex product\u201d puzzles) one finds that certain keys are defined by a formula like k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n). In our case the values above come directly from writing each key in that form (that is, dividing k\u2099 by n and taking the quotient as f(n)). (Also note that k\u2085 was given separately as k\u2082\u00b7k\u2083 so it does not fit into this linear formula.) \n\nThus, our final answer is:\n\n\u2003\u2003f(7) = 10,\u2003f(8) = 28,\u2003f(9) = 51,\u2003f(11) = 105,\u2003f(12) = 223.",
