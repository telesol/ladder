  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence, either linear (k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}) or linear with a constant term (k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c). The user provided the equations for k7 and k8, and wants to know if there are integer coefficients a and b (and maybe c) that satisfy these equations. Let me start with the linear recurrence first.\n\nFirst, let's write down the equations given. For k7 = 76:\n\n76 = 49a + 21b  ...(1)\n\nAnd for k8 = 224:\n\n224 = 76a + 49b  ...(2)\n\nWe need to solve this system of equations for a and b. The user mentioned integer solutions, so I need to check if there are integers a and b that satisfy both equations.\n\nLet me try solving these equations step by step. Let me write them again:\n\nEquation (1): 49a + 21b = 76\n\nEquation (2): 76a + 49b = 224\n\nHmm, maybe we can use the method of elimination here. Let's try to eliminate one variable. Let's try to eliminate 'a' first. To do that, we can multiply Equation (1) by 76 and Equation (2) by 49 so that the coefficients of 'a' will be the same. Wait, that might get messy, but let me see:\n\nMultiply Equation (1) by 76:\n\n49*76 a + 21*76 b = 76*76\n\nMultiply Equation (2) by 49:\n\n76*49 a + 49*49 b = 224*49\n\nThen subtract the two equations to eliminate 'a'? Wait, actually, since they are both multiplied by 49*76a, so if I subtract, the 'a' terms would cancel?\n\nWait, actually, let's think again. Let me denote:\n\nLet me call Equation (1): 49a + 21b = 76\n\nEquation (2): 76a + 49b = 224\n\nLet me try to solve for one variable in terms of another. Let's solve Equation (1) for a:\n\n49a = 76 - 21b => a = (76 - 21b)/49\n\nHmm, but fractions might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe solve for a from Equation (1):\n\na = (76 - 21b)/49\n\nThen plug this into Equation (2):\n\n76*( (76 - 21b)/49 ) + 49b = 224\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 76*(76 - 21b)/49 + 49b = 224\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n(76*76)/49 - (76*21b)/49 + 49b = 224\n\nCompute each term:\n\n76*76 is 5776, so 5776/49\n\n76*21 is 1596, so 1596b/49\n\nThus:\n\n5776/49 - (1596b)/49 + 49b = 224\n\nLet me combine the terms with b:\n\nFirst term: 5776/49\n\nSecond and third terms: - (1596b)/49 + 49b = [ -1596/49 + 49 ] b\n\nCompute -1596/49 + 49:\n\nConvert 49 to 49/1, so common denominator 49:\n\n-1596/49 + (49*49)/49 = (-1596 + 2401)/49 = (2401 - 1596)/49\n\nCalculate 2401 - 1596: Let me compute 2400 - 1596 = 804, then add 1: 805. So 805/49\n\nThus the equation becomes:\n\n5776/49 + (805/49)b = 224\n\nMultiply both sides by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n5776 + 805b = 224*49\n\nCompute 224*49: Let's see, 200*49 = 9800, 24*49 = 1176, so total is 9800 + 1176 = 10976\n\nSo equation: 5776 + 805b = 10976\n\nSubtract 5776 from both sides:\n\n805b = 10976 - 5776\n\nCalculate 10976 - 5776: 10976 - 5000 = 5976, then subtract 776 more: 5976 - 776 = 5200\n\nWait, actually, 10976 - 5776. Let me do it step by step:\n\n10976 minus 5000 is 5976, then subtract 776: 5976 - 700 = 5276, 5276 - 76 = 5200. Yes, so 5200.\n\nThus, 805b = 5200\n\nSolve for b:\n\nb = 5200 / 805\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n5200 \u00f75 = 1040; 805 \u00f75 = 161\n\nSo 1040 / 161. Hmm, does 161 divide into 1040?\n\n161*6 = 966, 1040 - 966 = 74, so no, so it's 1040/161. Not an integer. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so b would have to be a fraction here, but the user asked for integer a and b. Since this gives a fractional value for b, maybe there are no integer solutions? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a calculation mistake in the steps above. Let me check the steps again.\n\nStarting again with equations:\n\nEquation (1): 49a + 21b = 76\n\nEquation (2): 76a + 49b = 224\n\nLet me try another approach. Let me write the equations as a matrix and see if I can compute the determinant or something.\n\nThe system is:\n\n49a + 21b = 76\n\n76a + 49b = 224\n\nLet me write this in matrix form:\n\n[49  21][a]   = [76]\n\n[76  49][b]     [224]\n\nThe determinant of the coefficient matrix is (49)(49) - (21)(76). Let me compute that:\n\n49*49 = 2401\n\n21*76 = let's see 20*76=1520, plus 1*76=76, so 1520+76=1596\n\nThus determinant D = 2401 - 1596 = 805.\n\nSince determinant is non-zero, there is a unique solution. The solution is given by Cramer's rule:\n\na = ( |76   21| ) / D\n\n      |224 49|\n\nSimilarly for b.\n\nCompute numerator for a:\n\n|76   21|\n\n|224 49| = (76*49) - (21*224)\n\nCompute 76*49: 70*49=3430, 6*49=294, total 3430+294=3724\n\n21*224: 20*224=4480, 1*224=224, so 4480+224=4704\n\nThus numerator for a is 3724 - 4704 = -980\n\nThus a = -980 / 805\n\nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 5: -196 / 161. Still not integer.\n\nSimilarly, for b:\n\nNumerator is |49  76|\n\n             |76 224|\n\nWhich is 49*224 - 76*76\n\nCompute 49*224: 50*224 = 11200, minus 1*224=224, so 11200 -224=10976\n\n76*76: 5776\n\nThus numerator is 10976 -5776 = 5200\n\nSo b = 5200 / 805 = same as before, 1040 /161 \u2248 6.46\n\nHmm, so neither a nor b are integers, so the answer would be no, there are no integer coefficients a and b for the linear recurrence. But the user asked to check, so maybe they want to know if there are real numbers? But the question specifically says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So the answer would be no, no integer solutions. But let me confirm my calculations once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the determinant or the cross products.\n\nWait, let me check the cross product for a again:\n\nThe determinant for a is replacing the first column with the constants:\n\n76 and 224. So determinant is (76)(49) - (21)(224)\n\nYes, which is 76*49 - 21*224\n\n76*49: Let me compute 70*49=3430, 6*49=294, so total 3430+294=3724\n\n21*224: 20*224=4480, 1*224=224, total 4704. 3724 -4704 is -980, correct.\n\nSimilarly for b's numerator, 49*224 -76*76.\n\n49*224: 49*(200+24)=49*200=9800 +49*24=1176, total 9800+1176=10976\n\n76*76=5776, so 10976 -5776=5200, correct.\n\nThus, indeed a = -980/805 and b=5200/805. Simplify fractions:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by GCD(980,805). Let's see, GCD(805,980). 980 \u00f7805 =1 with remainder 175. Then GCD(805,175). 805 \u00f7175=4*175=700, remainder 105. GCD(175,105). 175 \u00f7105=1 r70; GCD(105,70)=35. GCD(70,35)=35. Thus GCD is 35.\n\nSo 980 \u00f735=28, 805 \u00f735=23. So a= -28/23. Hmm, but 980 divided by 35 is 28, yes. So -28/23.\n\nSimilarly, 5200 and 805. Let's compute GCD(5200,805). 5200 \u00f7805=6*805=4830, remainder 370. Then GCD(805,370). 805 \u00f7370=2*370=740, remainder 65. GCD(370,65). 370 \u00f765=5*65=325, rem 45. GCD(65,45). 65-45=20, GCD(45,20). Then GCD(20,5)=5. So GCD is 5. Thus 5200/5=1040, 805/5=161. So 1040/161. 161 divides into 1040 how? 161*6=966, 1040-966=74, so it's 6 and 74/161. Not an integer.\n\nThus, the solution requires a and b to be fractions, so there's no integer solution. Therefore, the answer is no, there are no integer coefficients a and b for the linear recurrence.\n\nBut before I conclude, maybe the user made a typo? Wait, the problem says \"For k7 = 76\" and \"k8 =224\". If those values are correct, then indeed there's no integer solution. Alternatively, maybe I need to check for a linear recurrence with a constant term, like k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2} + c. Let's try that.\n\nSo the user also mentioned: \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\". Let's see if this works.\n\nSo with this form, the equations become:\n\nFor k7 =76:\n\n76 = a*k6 + b*k5 + c\n\nWait, but hold on, do we have the previous terms? The problem mentions k7 and k8, but we might need more information. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the user only provided k7 and k8, but to form equations for a recurrence involving k_{n-1} and k_{n-2}, we need the prior terms. Wait, actually in their initial setup, they wrote:\n\n\"For k7 = 76:\n\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n\n224 = 76a + 49b\"\n\nSo they must have assumed that k6 is 49 and k5 is 21? Because otherwise, where do 49 and 21 come from?\n\nAh, so perhaps the prior terms are known? Let me check.\n\nSuppose that the sequence prior to k7 is known as follows:\n\nSuppose the terms are k5, k6, k7, k8,...\n\nSo when computing k7, they use k6 and k5. So if k6 is 49, k5 is 21, then k7=76. Then k8 would be a\u00d7k7 + b\u00d7k6 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749, which is given as 224.\n\nTherefore, in that case, the equations are as above. So, assuming that the prior terms are known (like k5=21, k6=49), then the equations for a and b are as given. But since those equations don't have integer solutions, the answer is no for the linear recurrence without constant term.\n\nNow, trying with the constant term: Let's suppose that the recurrence is k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2} + c. Then for k7 and k8, the equations become:\n\nk7 = a k6 + b k5 + c => 76 = 49a +21b + c ...(3)\n\nk8 = a k7 + b k6 + c =>224 =76a +49b +c ...(4)\n\nNow we have two equations but three variables (a, b, c). To find a solution, we need another equation, but since we only have k7 and k8, maybe we can assume another term?\n\nWait, perhaps we can express c from equation (3) and substitute into equation (4):\n\nFrom (3): c =76 -49a -21b\n\nPlug into (4):\n\n224 =76a +49b + (76 -49a -21b)\n\nSimplify:\n\n224 =76a +49b +76 -49a -21b\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n224 -76 = (76a -49a) + (49b -21b)\n\n148 =27a +28b\n\nSo now, we have one equation: 27a +28b =148. We can try to find integer solutions for a and b.\n\nLet me see: 27a +28b =148\n\nWe can solve for a in terms of b:\n\n27a =148 -28b => a=(148 -28b)/27\n\nWe need a to be an integer, so (148 -28b) must be divisible by 27.\n\nLet me see possible integer values for b.\n\nLet me think of 28b \u2261148 mod27\n\nCompute 28 mod27=1, 148 mod27: 27*5=135, 148-135=13. So 28b \u2261 b \u226113 mod27\n\nThus, b \u226113 mod27. So possible b =13, 40, -14,... But since 28b must be less than 148 (since 27a is positive?), let's see:\n\nSuppose b=13:\n\nThen a=(148 -28*13)/27=(148-364)/27= (-216)/27= -8\n\nThus a= -8, b=13 gives a solution.\n\nCheck if this works:\n\nThen c=76 -49*(-8) -21*(13)=76 +392 -273= (76+392)=468 -273=195\n\nSo c=195.\n\nCheck equation (4):\n\n224=76*(-8)+49*13 +195\n\nCalculate 76*(-8)= -608; 49*13=637; -608+637=29; 29 +195=224. Correct.\n\nSo yes, with a=-8, b=13, c=195, the equations are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, there is a solution with integer coefficients for the recurrence with a constant term.\n\nSo the answer would be: For the linear recurrence without constant term, no integer solution exists. But for the linear recurrence with constant term, there is a solution with a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nBut the question is: the user says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" but then adds \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\". So maybe the user is asking both? The initial question was \"Can you find integer a, b?\" referring to the first case (without c). But maybe they want to know if with c it's possible.\n\nSo the answer would be: No integer a and b exist for the simple linear recurrence, but there is a solution when allowing a constant term c, with a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nHowever, since the user's exact question is: \"F: Can you find integer a, b?\" and then adds \"Also try...\", maybe they want both answers. Since in the problem statement as given, the user might have intended to include the constant term as part of the possible recurrences, so maybe the answer is that with the constant term, it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only about the simple linear recurrence without constant term, then the answer is no.\n\nLooking back at the original problem:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"F: Can you find integer a, b?\"\n\nSo the main question is about the linear recurrence without constant term. The \"also try\" is an additional part. So the direct answer is: No, there are no integer solutions for a and b in the recurrence k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2}. However, if we allow a constant term c, then there is a solution with a=-8, b=13, and c=195.\n\nTherefore, the answer depends on whether the constant term is allowed. Since the problem first asks about a and b (without c), then says \"also try...\", I think the expected answer is that with the constant term it works, so the boxed answer would be with the constant term, but since the user might be expecting just the existence or the coefficients?\n\nWait, but the user says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". Since the question was \"Can you find integer a, b?\", the answer is \"No\", but the user might want the answer for the recurrence with constant term? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if there's another possible solution with smaller numbers?\n\nLet me see equation 27a +28b =148.\n\nWe found b=13 gives a=-8, but maybe other solutions?\n\nLet me see for example, trying b= 13 -27= -14,\n\nThen a=(148 -28*(-14))/27=(148 +392)/27=540/27=20. So a=20, b=-14.\n\nCheck:\n\n27*20 +28*(-14)=540 -392=148. Yes, works.\n\nThen c=76 -49*20 -21*(-14)=76 -980 +294=76 + ( -980 +294)=76 -686= -610.\n\nCheck equation (4):\n\n224=76*20 +49*(-14)+(-610)=1520 -686 -610=1520-1296=224. Correct.\n\nSo another solution a=20, b=-14, c=-610.\n\nSo infinitely many solutions since we have one equation with three variables, but with c dependent on a and b.\n\nBut the minimal or simplest might be the first one with a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nTherefore, since the question allows a constant term, the answer is yes, with those coefficients. Since the user mentioned \"Also try...\", the answer is yes, so the boxed answer would be the triplet (a,b,c), but since the question asks for a and b, perhaps specifying that with c included?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might want only the existence, so \"Yes\" with the coefficients, but in the format requested.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem first asks \"Can you find integer a, b?\" without c, then the answer is no, but with c, the answer is yes. Since the user instruction is to put the final answer in a box, maybe they want the coefficients when allowing c, so the answer is \\boxed{a = -8}, \\boxed{b = 13}, and \\boxed{c = 195}, but that's three boxes. Alternatively, since the problem mentions a and b, but the constant term is an addition, perhaps the answer is that it is possible with c, so the existence is yes, but boxed as ?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to see the exact problem again.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"F: Can you find integer a, b?\n\nAlso try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\"\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in Chinese? The \"F:\" might be a mistranslation or formatting.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is: Given that k7=76, k8=224, and assuming that prior terms are k6=49 and k5=21 (since in the equations they used 49 and 21 as coefficients), can we find integers a and b such that k7 = a*k6 + b*k5, and similarly for k8 = a*k7 + b*k6. Since that gives the system which has no solution. But when allowing a constant term, the answer is yes.\n\nGiven that the user says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", likely expects the values of a and b (and maybe c) if possible. Since with the constant term, there are solutions, so the answer is yes with a=-8, b=13 and c=195. But since the question first asks for a and b, maybe they want to know that with c, so the answer is possible, so the existence is positive. But the user might want the coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem might be in the style of a competition question where sometimes even with a constant term, you can represent it as a linear recurrence with coefficients, maybe the minimal polynomial, but in this case, since we have two equations, you can only determine the relation up to the constant.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have had a typo and the numbers are different. Alternatively, perhaps the prior terms are different?\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\n\"For k7 = 76:\n\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n\n224 = 76a + 49b\"\n\nTherefore, they are using k6=49 and k5=21 for k7, and k7=76 and k6=49 for k8.\n\nSo the prior terms are k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224.\n\nAssuming that the recurrence is of order 2, so each term is a linear combination of the two before.\n\nTherefore, the equations are:\n\n76 = a*49 + b*21,\n\n224 = a*76 + b*49.\n\nThis is a system of two equations with two variables a and b.\n\nLet me write them:\n\n49a +21b =76,\n\n76a +49b =224.\n\nWe can solve this system.\n\nMultiply the first equation by 49 and the second by21 to eliminate b:\n\nFirst equation *49: 49*49 a +49*21 b =49*76,\n\nSecond equation *21: 21*76 a +21*49 b =21*224.\n\nSubtract the first new equation from the second:\n\n(21*76 a -49^2 a) + (21*49 b -49*21 b)=21*224 -49*76\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\nFor a:\n\n21*76 a -49^2 a =a*(21*76 -49^2)\n\n21*76 = 1596,\n\n49^2=2401,\n\nThus 1596 -2401= -805,\n\nFor the constants:\n\n21*224 =4704,\n\n49*76=3724,\n\nThus 4704 -3724=980.\n\nThus equation becomes:\n\n-805a =980 => a= 980 / (-805)= simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n980/5=196, 805/5=161,\n\nThus a= -196/161.\n\nSimplify further: 196=28*7, 161=23*7,\n\nThus a= - (28*7)/(23*7)= -28/23\u2248-1.217, which is not integer.\n\nTherefore, no integer solution for a and b.\n\nHence, the answer is no for the simple linear recurrence.\n\nHowever, with a constant term, as we saw, there is a solution. Since the user mentioned \"also try\", which includes the constant term, so the answer is yes with the constant term.\n\nBut since the user's question is \"Can you find integer a, b?\" (without c), the answer is no. But since they mentioned the \"also try\", perhaps they want the answer with the constant term.\n\nAssuming that the problem allows the constant term, then the answer is yes, and the values are a=-8, b=13, c=195. So the user might expect the answer as a triplet, but since they asked for a and b, maybe just stating that with a constant term it's possible and giving the values.\n\nGiven the instructions say \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", which usually expects a single boxed answer, maybe indicating that with the constant term, so the existence is possible, but the exact answer would be the triplet. Since three numbers, perhaps boxed as a set.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects to consider that the question allows for the constant term, so the answer is \\boxed{-8} for a and \\boxed{13} for b with c=195. But since the question mentions a and b, maybe they just want to know that it's possible, so the answer is \\boxed{Yes} but I think in math problems like this, they want the coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the constant term solution? Let's verify again.\n\nWith a=-8, b=13, c=195,\n\nFirst equation: 49a +21b +c =49*(-8)+21*13 +195= -392 +273 +195= (-392+273)= -119 +195=76, correct.\n\nSecond equation:76a +49b +c=76*(-8)+49*13 +195= -608 +637 +195= ( -608+637)=29 +195=224, correct.\n\nYes, that works. So the coefficients are a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nTherefore, if the problem allows a constant term, then the answer is possible with those coefficients. Since the user's \"Also try\" suggests considering that case, then the answer is that there are integers a, b, and c (with c=195) making the recurrence valid. Since the question specifically asked for a and b, maybe the answer is a=-8 and b=13, with c being part of the recurrence.\n\nGiven the instructions to put the answer in a box, perhaps the user expects the values of a and b for the recurrence with constant term, so:\n\na = \\boxed{-8}, b = \\boxed{13}\n\nBut since two answers, maybe comma separated: \\boxed{-8} and \\boxed{13}\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is in Chinese and \"F\" stands for something else, but without more context, I'll proceed with this.\n\nAlternatively, the problem may have a different approach. Suppose the recurrence is of order 2 without constant term, but the user is to find a and b such that:\n\nk7 = a*k6 + b*k5,\n\nk8 = a*k7 + b*k6,\n\nWhich is the system:\n\n49a +21b =76,\n\n76a +49b =224.\n\nWe can write this as a matrix equation:\n\n[49 21][a]   = [76]\n\n[76 49][b]     [224]\n\nTo solve:\n\nCompute determinant D=49*49 -21*76= 2401 - 1596=805.\n\nThen a=(76*49 -21*224)/D,\n\nb=(49*224 -76*76)/D,\n\nCompute numerator for a:\n\n76*49=3724,\n\n21*224=4704,\n\nThus a=(3724 -4704)/805= (-980)/805= -196/161\u2248-1.217,\n\nSimilarly for b:\n\n49*224=10976,\n\n76*76=5776,\n\nThus b=(10976 -5776)/805=5200/805= divide numerator and denominator by 5: 1040/161\u22486.46.\n\nThus no integer solutions. Hence, the answer is no for a and b without c.\n\nGiven all that, the conclusion is: without constant term, no solution. With constant term, yes with a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nSince the user mentioned \"Also try...\", the answer is yes with those coefficients, so boxed as the triplet? But instructions say \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". Maybe the question expects just the existence, so the answer is \\boxed{-8} and \\boxed{13} for a and b with the constant term. Alternatively, since the problem might have intended the constant term, the answer is possible with those a and b, so boxed as \\boxed{-8} and \\boxed{13}.\n\nBut as per the initial question asking for a and b integers (without mentioning c), the answer is no. But since the user added \"Also try...\", which includes c, the answer is yes with those values.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the problem's flow, the user probably wants the answer with the constant term, so the values of a and b are -8 and 13. Hence, boxed individually.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe integers are \\( a = \\boxed{-8} \\) and \\( b = \\boxed{13} \\) with a constant term \\( c = 195 \\).\n",
