  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence, which would mean each term is a linear combination of the two previous terms, like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}. The user also mentioned checking if there's a constant term added, like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c. They provided two equations based on the values of k7 and k8, so I should start with those.\n\nFirst, let's focus on the Fibonacci-like part without the constant. The equations given are:\n\nFor k7 = 76:\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = 76a + 49b\n\nI need to solve this system of equations for a and b. Let me write them down again:\n\n1) 49a + 21b = 76\n\n2) 76a + 49b = 224\n\nHmm, okay. Since both equations have two variables, maybe I can use substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination. Let's see if I can multiply the equations by some numbers so that the coefficients of a or b match.\n\nLooking at the coefficients of a: 49 and 76. Maybe I can multiply the first equation by 76 and the second by 49 so that the coefficients of a would be 49\u00d776 and 76\u00d749, which are the same. Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe multiply the first equation by 49 and the second by 21, so that the coefficients of b can be eliminated?\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me try to eliminate one variable. Let's try to eliminate a first. To do that, the coefficients of a in both equations should be the same. The coefficients are 49 and 76. Let me find the least common multiple of 49 and 76. Hmm, 49 is 7\u00b2, 76 is 4\u00d719. So LCM is 49\u00d776 = 3724. That's a big number. Maybe that's not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's take the first equation:\n\n49a + 21b = 76\n\nLet's solve for a:\n\n49a = 76 - 21b\n\na = (76 - 21b)/49\n\nHmm, that's okay. Then substitute this into the second equation:\n\n76a + 49b = 224\n\nSubstituting a:\n\n76*( (76 - 21b)/49 ) + 49b = 224\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 76*( (76 - 21b)/49 )\n\n= (76*76)/49 - (76*21b)/49\n\n= (5776)/49 - (1596b)/49\n\nThen, adding the 49b term:\n\n(5776/49 - 1596b/49) + 49b = 224\n\nCombine the terms with b:\n\n-1596b/49 + 49b = (-1596b + 49*49b)/49\n\nWait, let me compute that properly:\n\nFirst term: -1596b/49\n\nSecond term: 49b is the same as (49b *49)/49 = 2401b/49 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, 49b is the same as (49b * 49)/49? Wait, no. To add them together, they need a common denominator.\n\nWait, actually, the second term is 49b which can be written as (49b *49)/49? No, that's not right. Wait, maybe I should convert 49b to have denominator 49:\n\n49b = (49b * 49)/49? No, that's overcomplicating. Let me see:\n\nWait, the equation after substitution is:\n\n(5776)/49 - (1596b)/49 + 49b = 224\n\nSo, the terms with b are (-1596b)/49 + 49b. Let's combine them:\n\nLet me factor b:\n\nb [ -1596/49 + 49 ]\n\nCompute 49 as 49/1. So, common denominator 49:\n\n-1596/49 + (49*49)/49 = (-1596 + 49\u00b2)/49\n\n49 squared is 2401. So, -1596 + 2401 = 805.\n\nThus, that term becomes 805b /49\n\nSo, the entire equation becomes:\n\n5776/49 + (805b)/49 = 224\n\nMultiply both sides by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n5776 + 805b = 224 *49\n\nCompute 224*49. Let me compute that:\n\n224 *50 would be 11200, so 224*49 = 224*(50-1) = 11200 -224 = 10976\n\nSo,\n\n5776 +805b = 10976\n\nSubtract 5776 from both sides:\n\n805b = 10976 -5776\n\nCalculate 10976 -5776:\n\n10976 minus 5000 is 5976, then minus 776 more: 5976 -776 = 5200? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, 10976 - 5776:\n\n10,976 minus 5,000 is 5,976\n\nThen subtract 776 more: 5,976 - 700 = 5,276, then -76 is 5,200. Yes, 5200.\n\nSo, 805b = 5200\n\nTherefore, b = 5200 /805\n\nLet me simplify this fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n5200 \u00f75 = 1040\n\n805 \u00f75 = 161\n\nSo, 1040/161. Hmm, let's see if that can be reduced further.\n\n161 divides by 7? 7*23 is 161 (since 7*20=140, plus 21 is 161). Wait, 7*23 is 161?\n\nWait 7*23 is 161. Let me check 7*20=140, plus 7*3=21, so total 161. Yes.\n\nCheck if 1040 divisible by 7? 7*148 is 1036, so 1040-1036=4, so no. So 1040/161 is in simplest terms. Hmm, so b is 1040/161 which is approximately 6.46...\n\nHmm, but the problem mentions \"integer a,b\". The user said \"Can you find integer a,b?\" So unless these fractions reduce to integers, which they don't seem to, then there are no integer solutions for a and b. Hmm. Wait maybe I made a calculation mistake?\n\nLet me check the steps again.\n\nStarting with the substitution:\n\nFrom first equation: a = (76 -21b)/49\n\nSubstitute into second equation:\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nSo,\n\n76*( (76 -21b)/49 ) +49b =224\n\nYes.\n\nCompute 76*(76 -21b)/49:\n\n76*76 is 5776, 76*(-21b) is -1596b, so numerator is 5776 -1596b, over 49.\n\nThen adding 49b:\n\nSo total equation:\n\n(5776 -1596b)/49 +49b =224\n\nThen, to combine terms, common denominator 49:\n\n[5776 -1596b + 49b*49]/49 =224\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps I messed up the 49b term? Let me re-express the equation:\n\nOriginal equation after substitution:\n\n(5776 -1596b)/49 +49b =224\n\nTo combine terms, write 49b as (49b *49)/49 ?\n\nWait no, actually, that's not necessary. Let me instead write:\n\nMultiply all terms by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n5776 -1596b +49b *49 = 224*49\n\nWait, that might be a better approach. Let me do that again.\n\nStarting from:\n\n(5776 -1596b)/49 +49b =224\n\nMultiply both sides by 49:\n\n5776 -1596b +49b*49 = 224*49\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo:\n\nLeft side: 5776 -1596b + (49*49)b\n\nRight side: 224*49\n\nCompute 49*49 is 2401. So:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b = 224*49\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n5776 + (2401b -1596b) = 224*49\n\n2401 -1596 = 805, so 805b.\n\nThus, 5776 +805b = 224*49\n\nEarlier, I computed 224*49 as 10976, which is correct.\n\nSo 5776 +805b =10976\n\nSubtract 5776: 805b = 10976-5776 = 5200\n\nSo 805b=5200 => b=5200/805\n\nHmm, which reduces to 1040/161, as before. Let me check 161*6 = 966, 161*6.4 is 161*(6 + 0.4) = 966 + 64.4 = 1030.4, which is less than 1040. Hmm, so decimal is about 6.46. Not integer.\n\nTherefore, if we require a and b to be integers, this would not work. So maybe there's no integer solution for a and b in the Fibonacci-like recurrence?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations? Let's double-check the arithmetic.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n49a +21b =76\n\nSecond equation:\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nLet me try another approach, using elimination without substitution.\n\nLet me arrange the equations:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me multiply Equation1 by 76 and Equation2 by 49 so that coefficients of a can be subtracted. Wait, but that might be messy. Alternatively, let's try to eliminate b.\n\nThe coefficients of b in Equation1 is 21, in Equation2 is49. Let's make them equal. Multiply Equation1 by 49 and Equation2 by21:\n\nEquation1*49: 49*49a +21*49b =76*49\n\nEquation2*21:76*21a +49*21b =224*21\n\nThus:\n\nEquation1*49: 2401a + 1029b = 3724 (since 76*49=3724)\n\nEquation2*21: 1596a +1029b = 4704 (since 224*21=4704)\n\nNow subtract Equation1*49 - Equation2*21:\n\n(2401a -1596a) + (1029b -1029b)= 3724 -4704\n\nSo 805a = -980\n\nThus, a = -980 /805\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n-196 / 161\n\nHmm, so a is -196/161, which reduces further? Let's see 196 is 49*4, 161 is 7*23. No common factors, so a is -196/161. Not integer.\n\nHmm, so that's the same result as before, just through a different method. So a is a fraction, not integer. So that would mean there's no integer solution for a and b in the Fibonacci-like recurrence. So the answer would be no?\n\nWait, but the user said \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So perhaps it's a trick question where the answer is no? But maybe I need to check if there's a constant term, the second part of the problem: \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\"\n\nSo maybe there is a constant term c. Let me try that.\n\nSo let's consider the recurrence: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\n\nThen for k7=76, we have:\n\n76 = a\u00d7k6 + b\u00d7k5 +c\n\nWait, but wait, the user's equations were for k7 and k8. Wait, the user mentions \"For k7=76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\" which suggests that the previous terms are k6=49 and k5=21. Wait, but the user didn't provide k5 and k6? Wait, actually, in the problem statement, they wrote:\n\n\"For k7 = 76:\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n224 = 76a + 49b\"\n\nSo, they assumed that k6=49 and k5=21? Because in the equation for k7, they used k6 and k5. Similarly, k8 uses k7 and k6. So, the prior terms k5 and k6 must be 21 and 49 respectively. But the user didn't give those values? Wait, maybe in their original problem (not stated here) those are known? Since the user is talking about \"the sequence\" but didn't provide all terms. Hmm. Anyway, proceeding with what's given.\n\nSo, if we consider including a constant term c, then for k7:\n\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721 + c --> 49a +21b +c =76\n\nFor k8:\n\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749 +c -->76a +49b +c =224\n\nSo now we have two equations with three variables (a, b, c). To solve, we need another equation. Since we need a recurrence relation, maybe we can use another term? But the user only provided up to k8. Unless there's an implicit assumption that the recurrence holds for all previous terms as well. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps if we assume that the recurrence holds for the term before k7, so for k7 and k8, but also for k6 and k5? Wait, but then we can get more equations.\n\nWait, but the problem might be that we don't have the prior terms except for k5 and k6. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the recurrence starts at some point, so let me suppose that for term k_n, the recurrence holds for n \u2265 some value. Since they provided equations for k7 and k8, perhaps the recurrence is supposed to hold starting at k7? But then we can't get more equations unless we have more terms. Alternatively, maybe the user is only giving the two equations for k7 and k8, so with the constant term, we can have two equations for three variables, so there might be a solution with some c. Let's see.\n\nSo with c, the equations are:\n\n1) 49a +21b +c =76\n\n2)76a +49b +c =224\n\nSubtract equation1 from equation2:\n\n(76a -49a) + (49b -21b) + (c -c) =224 -76\n\n27a +28b =148\n\nSo equation3:27a +28b =148\n\nNow, with three variables, but only two equations. To find a solution, we need another equation, which could be found by assuming the recurrence also holds for a previous term.\n\nSuppose that the recurrence holds for k6 as well. Let's assume that k6=49 is a result of the recurrence applied to the terms before it. Let\u2019s suppose that k6 = a\u00d7k5 + b\u00d7k4 +c. But since we don't know k4, this might not help. Alternatively, maybe the recurrence holds starting at k7, so that we don't need prior terms? But with two equations and three variables, we can't solve uniquely unless we make an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps there is a solution with integer a, b, c.\n\nLet me try to solve equation3 for integers a and b.\n\nEquation3: 27a +28b =148\n\nWe can try to find integers a and b that satisfy this.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n27a = 148 -28b --> a = (148 -28b)/27\n\nWe need numerator divisible by 27.\n\nLet me see possible integer values for b:\n\nLet me try b=2:\n\n(148 -56)/27 = 92/27 \u22483.407, not integer.\n\nb=1:\n\n148 -28=120 -->120/27 \u22484.444, nope.\n\nb=4:\n\n148 -112=36 --> 36/27=1.333, nope.\n\nb=5:\n\n148-140=8 -->8/27, nope.\n\nb=0:\n\n148/27\u22485.481, nope.\n\nb= -1:\n\n148 +28=176 -->176/27\u22486.518, nope.\n\nHmm, not working. Maybe b= 2:\n\nWait let me see:\n\nTrying b= 148 mod28?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake here. Let me check equation3 again:\n\nEquation2 - equation1: (76a +49b +c) - (49a +21b +c)=224 -76\n\nSo that is 27a +28b =148. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe fractions?\n\nSuppose a and b are fractions, then c can be found. But the problem is asking whether integer a,b,c exist?\n\nAlternatively, the user might have made a typo? Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the original problem includes more terms?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the constant term allows integer solutions.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there is a solution where a and b are fractions but c is integer?\n\nSuppose I let a and b be fractions such that 27a +28b=148, but then c would be 76 -49a -21b. Let me see if c can be integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Let me try to set variable substitution.\n\nLet me let a = (148 -28b)/27. Let me plug into equation1:\n\n49*( (148 -28b)/27 ) +21b +c =76\n\nCompute:\n\n49*(148 -28b)/27 +21b +c =76\n\nMultiply through by27 to eliminate denominators:\n\n49*(148 -28b) +21b*27 +27c =76*27\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n49*148: 49*(150-2)= 49*150 -49*2=7350-98=7252\n\n49*(-28b)= -1372b\n\n21b*27=567b\n\n27c\n\n76*27=2052\n\nSo:\n\n7252 -1372b +567b +27c =2052\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n7252 - (1372 -567)b +27c =2052\n\n1372 -567=805, so:\n\n7252 -805b +27c=2052\n\nThen,\n\n-805b +27c =2052 -7252= -5200\n\nThus, -805b +27c =-5200\n\nOr,\n\n27c =805b -5200\n\nHence,\n\nc=(805b -5200)/27\n\nHmm, to have c integer, numerator must be divisible by27.\n\nSo 805b \u22615200 mod27\n\nFirst, let's compute 805 mod27 and 5200 mod27.\n\n27*29=783, 805-783=22, so 805\u226122 mod27\n\n5200 divided by27: 27*192=5184, 5200-5184=16 \u21925200\u226116 mod27\n\nThus equation:\n\n22b \u226116 mod27\n\nWe need to solve 22b \u226116 mod27.\n\nMultiply both sides by the inverse of22 mod27.\n\nFind x such that22x\u22611 mod27.\n\n22 and27 coprime (gcd 1). Let's find inverse:\n\n27=1*22 +5\n\n22=4*5 +2\n\n5=2*2 +1\n\nBackwards:\n\n1=5-2*2\n\n=5 -2*(22 -4*5)=5*5 -2*22\n\n=5*(27 -1*22) -2*22=5*27 -7*22\n\nThus, -7*22 \u22611 mod27 \u2192 inverse of22 is -7 mod27, which is 20 mod27.\n\nThus inverse is20.\n\nThus multiply both sides:\n\n22b \u226116 mod27 \u2192 b\u226120*16 mod27\n\n20*16=320 \u2192320 mod27.\n\n27*11=297, 320-297=23 \u219223 mod27.\n\nThus b\u226123 mod27.\n\nThus possible solutions for b are b=23 +27k, where k is integer.\n\nThus, for example, b=23,\n\nthen a=(148 -28*23)/27=(148 -644)/27=(-496)/27\u2248-18.37, which is not integer.\n\nAlternatively, take k=-1, so b=23-27= -4,\n\nthen a=(148 -28*(-4))/27=(148+112)/27=260/27\u22489.63, not integer.\n\nk=2: b=23+54=77,\n\nthen a=(148 -28*77)/27= (148 -2156)/27= (-2008)/27, nope.\n\nHmm, so even with c, unless we allow fractions, there's no solution with integers a,b,c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require a,b,c to be integers? The original question just says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" but then for the second case with c, maybe it allows non-integers?\n\nWait, the user's question is: \"F: Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" The exact problem might be in Chinese, but the user's translation might have nuances. Wait, perhaps the problem is in the original to find whether there exists integers a,b such that the recurrence holds for k7 and k8, given the prior terms? Since the user provided the equations as such, perhaps the prior terms are given as k5=21, k6=49, then k7=76 and k8=224. So with those values, does there exist integers a and b such that 49a +21b=76 and 76a +49b=224? Which we saw doesn't have integer solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the problem setup? For instance, maybe k5 and k6 are different? Let me check the arithmetic for the equations:\n\nSuppose k5=21, k6=49,\n\nthen k7= a*k6 +b*k5 \u219276=49a +21b,\n\nk8= a*k7 +b*k6 \u2192224=76a +49b.\n\nThese are the two equations.\n\nLet me try to solve them as real numbers.\n\nFrom first equation: 49a +21b =76 \u2192 divide both sides by7: 7a +3b =76/7\u224810.857\n\nSecond equation:76a +49b =224 \u2192 divide by GCD(76,49)=1: 76a +49b=224.\n\nLet me use substitution.\n\nFrom first equation:7a= (76/7 -3b) \u2192a=(76/49 - (3/7)b)\n\nSubstitute into second equation:\n\n76*(76/49 - (3/7)b ) +49b =224\n\nHmm, this might get messy. Alternatively, let me use linear algebra.\n\nThe system:\n\n49a +21b =76\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nLet me write this as matrix:\n\n[49 21 |76]\n\n[76 49 |224]\n\nCompute determinant D=49*49 -21*76= 2401 -1596=805\n\nD_a: replace first column with constants:\n\n|76 21|\n\n|224 49| determinant:76*49 -21*224= 3724 -4704= -980\n\nD_b: replace second column with constants:\n\n|49 76|\n\n|76 224| determinant:49*224 -76*76= 11008 -5776=5232\n\nThus,\n\na= D_a / D = -980 /805 = -196/161 \u2248-1.217\n\nb= D_b /D =5232/805\u22486.5\n\nWait, so the solution is a= -196/161, b\u22486.5. Not integers.\n\nSo there are no integer solutions for a and b. Therefore the answer would be no, but the problem might be expecting something else?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find a and b such that the recurrence is applied multiple times? Or perhaps there was a mistake in the given terms?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where you have to notice that no integer solution exists, so the answer is no, but the question didn't specify to find them but maybe to do something else?\n\nWait, re-reading the user's input: The user wrote \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" But the original problem might have been in Chinese, and the user translated it. Maybe there was a different setup?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the value of a or b given some conditions?\n\nWait, the user's exact problem statement is not fully clear, since they just said \"F: Please...\" perhaps referring to the initial problem. Since the user provided the equations as:\n\nGiven k5=21, k6=49, then k7=76 and k8=224, find integers a and b such that k7 = a*k6 +b*k5 and k8 = a*k7 +b*k6.\n\nSince this has no solution, maybe the problem is to find a and b with fractions, but the question specifically asks for integers. Thus the answer is that there are no integer solutions, so maybe the problem is to recognize that, so the answer is \"No solution\", but since the user might expect a numerical answer, perhaps I need to check my calculations again.\n\nWait, let me recheck the determinant calculation:\n\nFirst equation:49a +21b =76\n\nSecond equation:76a +49b =224\n\nDeterminant D=49*49 -21*76\n\n49^2=2401, 21*76= 21*(70+6)=1470+126=1596\n\nThus D=2401 -1596= 805. Correct.\n\nD_a is determinant with first column replaced by [76;224]:\n\n76*49 -21*224=76*49= 3724, 21*224=4704, so 3724-4704= -980. Correct.\n\nThus a= -980/805 simplifies: divide numerator and denominator by 5: -196/161. 196 and 161: 161=23*7, 196=28*7. So 196/161=28/23. So a= -28/23\u2248-1.217\n\nSimilarly, D_b is determinant with second column replaced:\n\n49*224 -76*76.\n\n49*224: 49*(200+24)=9800+1176=10976\n\n76*76=5776\n\nThus D_b=10976-5776=5200\n\nThus b=5200/805= simplify divide numerator and denominator by5: 1040/161\u22486.46\n\nThus the exact solution is a= -28/23, b=1040/161. Not integers.\n\nTherefore, there are no integer solutions for a and b.\n\nHence, the answer is that there is no integer solution, but since the problem might expect an answer in boxed format, perhaps the question was different? Or maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find a and b where the recurrence is applied twice, leading to a system that can be solved?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had different numbers?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have been to find the next term in the sequence, but given the user provided equations, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is to find a and b with real numbers and then compute a + b?\n\nIf a= -28/23 and b=1040/161,\n\nthen a + b = (-28/23)+(1040/161)= convert to common denominator 161=23*7, so:\n\n-28/23= -28*7 /161= -196/161,\n\nthus total: (-196 +1040)/161=844/161\u22485.242.\n\nBut not sure if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the value of a certain expression, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the problem's constants. Let me check with different numbers.\n\nSuppose k5=21, k6=49, then if the equations were:\n\nk7 =a*49 +b*21=76,\n\nk8 =a*76 +b*49=224,\n\nthen solving:\n\n49a +21b =76 --> divide by7:7a +3b =76/7\u224810.857.\n\nSecond equation:76a +49b =224.\n\nIf we multiply first equation by7: 49a +21b=76,\n\nsecond equation:76a +49b=224.\n\nIf we do 7*(first equation): 343a +147b=532,\n\nsubtract from second equation*1: 76a +49b=224,\n\nWait, maybe another approach.\n\nLet me try multiplying the first equation by something to eliminate a variable.\n\nLet me multiply first equation by76, second by49:\n\nFirst*76:49*76 a +21*76 b =76*76,\n\nSecond*49:76*49 a +49*49 b=224*49,\n\nSubtract first from second:\n\n(76*49 a -49*76 a) + (49\u00b2 b -21*76 b)=224*49 -76\u00b2\n\nThe a terms cancel,\n\nThe b terms: b*(49\u00b2 -21*76)=...\n\nCalculate 49\u00b2=2401, 21*76=1596,\n\nThus 2401-1596=805,\n\nRHS:224*49 -76\u00b2\n\n224*49: 224*50=11200 -224=10976,\n\n76\u00b2=5776,\n\nThus RHS=10976 -5776=5200,\n\nThus 805b=5200 \u2192 b=5200/805=1040/161\u22486.46,\n\nThen from first equation:49a =76 -21b,\n\na=(76 -21*(1040/161))/49,\n\nCalculate 21*(1040/161)= (21*1040)/161=21* (1040/161),\n\n1040 divided by161: 161*6=966, 1040-966=74, so 6 +74/161,\n\nThus 21*(6 +74/161)=126 + (21*74)/161,\n\n21*74=1554,\n\n1554/161=9.65...\n\nWait, perhaps better:\n\n21*(1040)/161= (21/161)*1040= (3/23)*1040= 3120/23,\n\nThus a=(76 -3120/23)/49,\n\nConvert 76 to 76*23/23=1748/23,\n\nThus numerator:1748/23 -3120/23= (1748-3120)/23= (-1372)/23,\n\nThus a= (-1372/23)/49= (-1372)/(23*49)= -28/23,\n\nSo same as before. Therefore, the solution is a= -28/23, b=1040/161.\n\nIf the problem expects a fractional answer, perhaps a + b?\n\n-28/23 + 1040/161 = (-28*7 +1040)/161 = (-196 +1040)/161= 844/161 \u22485.242. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the value of a certain term, but given the user's input is incomplete, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem was to find the next term after 224, which would be k9 =a*224 +b*76,\n\nWith a and b found as fractions,\n\nk9= (-28/23)*224 + (1040/161)*76,\n\nCalculate:\n\n-28*224/23 = -6272/23,\n\n1040*76/161= (1040/161)*76,\n\nSince 1040/161 = 6.46, 6.46*76\u2248490,\n\nBut exact value:\n\n1040 divided by161 is 6.46, but 161*6=966, 1040-966=74,\n\nSo 1040=161*6 +74,\n\nThus (161*6 +74)/161 *76 =6*76 + (74*76)/161,\n\n6*76=456,\n\n74*76=5624,\n\n5624 divided by161,\n\n161*35=5635, so 5624=161*35 -11,\n\nThus 5624/161=35 -11/161,\n\nThus total:456 +35 -11/161=491 -11/161\u2248490.93,\n\nThus total k9\u2248-6272/23 +490.93,\n\n-6272 divided by23:23*272=6256, so -6272/23= -272.695,\n\nThus -272.695 +490.93\u2248218.23, but this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo, but since I have to go with the given info, and since the question as posed by the user is to \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", and given that there is no integer solution, but the problem might expect fractions, perhaps the question was to find a or b?\n\nWait, if the problem asks for a or b, then a= -28/23, b=1040/161, but these reduce?\n\nCheck if 1040/161 can be simplified: 161 divides into 1040 how many times?\n\n161*6=966, 1040-966=74, 74 and161 have GCD 74 and161: factors of74:2*37, 161=7*23, so no common factors. Thus 1040/161 is simplest.\n\nSimilarly, -28/23 is simplest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the value of a*b?\n\n(-28/23)*(1040/161)= (-28*1040)/(23*161)= (-29120)/3703\u2248-7.86.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be to find the continued fraction or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to recognize that the recurrence is linear and find its characteristic equation?\n\nThe recurrence is k_{n}=a k_{n-1} +b k_{n-2}\n\nThe characteristic equation would be r\u00b2 -a r -b=0,\n\nBut without more context, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven that the user's question is incomplete but based on the equations provided, the likely answer is that there is no integer solution for a and b, so the problem might expect stating that, but since the user might expect a numerical answer in boxed form, perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, checking the initial terms:\n\nIf k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224,\n\nCheck if the recurrence works with a=3 and b= -7:\n\nTest a=3, b=-7,\n\nThen k7 should be 3*49 + (-7)*21=147-147=0\u226076. Not.\n\nTry a=2:\n\nSuppose a=2, then 49*2=98, so 98 +21b=76 \u219221b= -22 \u2192b= -22/21. Not integer.\n\nTry a=1:\n\n49 +21b=76 \u219221b=27\u2192b=27/21=9/7.

So there is no integer solution.\n\nPerhaps the problem is designed to have a solution with a different recurrence order or different terms? Maybe a typo in the numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find a and b assuming a different recurrence, but given the info, I think the answer is that there is no integer solution, but since the user might expect fractions, boxed answers for a and b?\n\nThe problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", likely expects one boxed answer. Maybe the question was to find a or b?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are different. Let me check:\n\nIf k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224,\n\nLooking for a pattern:\n\nFrom 21 to49: +28,\n\n49 to76:+27,\n\n76 to224:+148,\n\nNot obvious.\n\nAlternatively, multiplying factors:\n\n49 is 21*2 +7,\n\n76=49*1 +27,\n\n224=76*3 -64,\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recurrence is of higher order?\n\nWith four terms, we can set a second-order recurrence (needs two equations), which we did, but no integer solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a third-order recurrence?\n\nNeed more equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a typo in the terms: if k7 were 77 instead of76,\n\nThen equations:\n\n49a +21b=77,\n\n77a +49b=224,\n\nSolving,\n\nFirst equation:49a +21b=77 \u21927a +3b=11,\n\nSecond:77a +49b=224 \u219211a +7b=32,\n\nNow,\n\n7a +3b=11,\n\n11a +7b=32,\n\nMultiply first by7:49a +21b=77,\n\nSecond by3:33a +21b=96,\n\nSubtract: (49a -33a)=16a=77-96= -19,\n\nThus a= -19/16,\n\nStill not integer.\n\nAlternatively, if k7= 70,\n\nThen 49a +21b=70 \u21927a +3b=10,\n\nk8=224=70a +49b,\n\n70a +49b=224 \u219210a +7b=32,\n\nNow system:\n\n7a +3b=10,\n\n10a +7b=32,\n\nMultiply first by7:49a +21b=70,\n\nSecond by3:30a +21b=96,\n\nSubtract:19a= -26 \u2192a= -26/19,\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, if k8 is different, say 234,\n\nThen:\n\n76a +49b=234,\n\nWith first equation 49a +21b=76,\n\nSolve:\n\nMultiply first by7:343a +147b=532,\n\nSecond by3:228a +147b=702,\n\nSubtract:115a= -170,\n\na= -170/115= -34/23,\n\nStill no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a different context where fractions are acceptable. The problem might just want the value of a or b expressed as fractions.\n\nGiven the user instruction, I think the problem might have wanted to solve for a and b, leading to a=-28/23 and b=1040/161, but since they are both fractions and the question might expect them boxed, but separately. Since the user might have intended a different setup, but given the information, the solution is as above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to compute a*b or a+b,\n\na +b= (-28/23)+(1040/161)= (-28*7 +1040)/161= ( -196 +1040)/161=844/161\u22485.242,\n\na*b=(-28/23)*(1040/161)= (-29120)/3703\u2248-7.86,\n\nBut without more context, hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be to find the next term k9 using these a and b, which we calculated as\u2248218.23, but not an integer.\n\nAlternatively, if the original problem had different numbers leading to integer a and b, but given the current numbers, the solution is fractions.\n\nGiven the user might have intended a and b as fractions, boxed:\n\na = \\boxed{-\\dfrac{28}{23}}, and b = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1040}{161}}\n\nBut since the question says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", maybe it expects one value, but not sure. Alternatively, the question might be to find the next term, which is fractional.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in calculation.\n\nWait, rechecking:\n\nFirst equation:\n\n49a +21b =76,\n\nDivide by 7:\n\n7a +3b =76/7 \u224810.857,\n\nSecond equation:\n\n76a +49b =224,\n\nDivide by, say GCD(76,49)=1,\n\nSo the system is consistent but no integer solution.\n\nAlternatively, if the terms were k5=21, k6=49, k7= 76, k8= 224,\n\nThen the user might have a different recurrence in mind, such as multiplicative? 21, 49 (21*2.333), 76 (49*1.55), 224 (76*2.947), not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the terms are part of a known sequence? Not that I recognize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find a and b for the recurrence relation, so the answer is a=-28/23 and b=1040/161, but presented as fractions boxed.\n\nSince the problem might be in the style of math competitions where answers are fractions, I will box them.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{28}{23}}\\) and \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{1040}{161}}\\) respectively.\n",
