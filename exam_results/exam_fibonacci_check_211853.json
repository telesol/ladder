  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence. The problem gives me two equations based on the terms k\u2087 = 76 and k\u2088 = 224, and asks if there exist integers a and b such that k\u2099 = a\u00d7k\u2099\u208b\u2081 + b\u00d7k\u2099\u208b\u2082. They also mention considering a possible constant term c, but maybe I should start with the linear recurrence first.\n\nSo starting with the linear recurrence without the constant term, the two equations are:\n\n1) 76 = 49a + 21b\n2) 224 = 76a + 49b\n\nHmm, I need to solve this system of equations for a and b. Let me write them down again:\n\nEquation 1: 49a + 21b = 76  \nEquation 2: 76a + 49b = 224\n\nI can use the method of elimination here. Let me try multiplying the first equation by 76 and the second equation by 49 to make the coefficients of 'a' the same, then subtract them. Wait, maybe that's too big. Alternatively, maybe subtract a multiple of one equation from the other to eliminate one variable.\n\nAlternatively, let's try solving for one variable in terms of the other from the first equation and substitute into the second. Let's solve Equation 1 for a:\n\n49a = 76 - 21b  \n=> a = (76 - 21b)/49\n\nHmm, but fractions might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe use substitution with smaller numbers. Let me see if there is a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's write the equations in terms of coefficients:\n\nEquation 1: 49a + 21b = 76  \nEquation 2: 76a + 49b = 224\n\nLet me try multiplying the first equation by 49 and the second equation by 21, so that the coefficients of b in both will be 21*49 and 49*21, which might allow elimination. Let's try:\n\nMultiply Equation 1 by 49:  \n49*(49a) + 49*(21b) = 49*76  \n=> 2401a + 1029b = 3724\n\nMultiply Equation 2 by 21:  \n21*(76a) + 21*(49b) = 21*224  \n=> 1596a + 1029b = 4704\n\nNow subtract the first new equation from the second new equation to eliminate b:\n\n(1596a + 1029b) - (2401a + 1029b) = 4704 - 3724  \n1596a - 2401a = 980  \n-805a = 980  \n=> a = 980 / (-805)  \nHmm, simplifying this fraction. Let's see, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5:  \n980 \u00f75 = 196; 805 \u00f75 = 161  \nSo a = -196/161. Hmm, that's a fraction, and since we were supposed to find integer a and b, this is a problem. Maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an arithmetic error in multiplying. Let me check:\n\nOriginal equations:\n\nEquation 1: 49a +21b =76  \nEquation 2:76a +49b=224\n\nMultiplying Equation1 by 49: 49*49a =49\u00b2a=2401a, 49*21b=1029b, 49*76=3724. That's correct.\n\nEquation2 multiplied by21: 76a*21= 76*21a= 1596a, 49b*21=1029b, 224*21= 4704. That's correct.\n\nSubtracting: 1596a -2401a = (1596-2401)a = -805a. 4704 -3724=980. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo a is -196/161, which is approximately -1.217. Not integer. Hmm. So that suggests no integer solution for a and b here. Wait, but the question says \"can you find integer a, b?\" Maybe there's an error in my approach?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if there is a different way. Let me try using another method. Let me try to write the equations as:\n\nLet me denote the equations again:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b =76  \nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me try to compute the determinant of the coefficient matrix to see if there's a solution. The system is:\n\n[49  21] [a]   = [76]  \n[76  49] [b]     [224]\n\nThe determinant is (49)(49) - (21)(76). Let me calculate that:\n\n49*49 = 2401  \n21*76: 21*70=1470, 21*6=126 \u2192 total 1470+126=1596  \nSo determinant is 2401 -1596 = 805.\n\nSince determinant is non-zero, there is a unique solution. But the solution is (a,b) given by:\n\na = ( (76)(49) - (21)(224) ) /805  \nb = ( (49)(224) - (76)(76) ) /805\n\nWait, using Cramer's rule:\n\na = [ (76*49 - 21*224) ] / determinant\n\nCalculating numerator for a:\n\n76*49: Let's compute 70*49=3430, 6*49=294 \u2192 total 3430+294=3724  \n21*224: 20*224=4480, 1*224=224 \u2192 total 4480+224=4704  \nSo numerator for a: 3724 -4704 = -980  \nThus a = -980 /805 = -196/161 \u2248 same as before.\n\nSimilarly for b:\n\nNumerator for b: (49*224 -76*76)  \n49*224: 50*224=11200 minus 1*224=224 \u2192 11200-224=10976  \n76*76: 70*70=4900, 70*6*2=840, 6*6=36 \u2192 (70+6)^2 = 76\u00b2 = 5776? Wait, better compute 76*76:\n\n76*70=5320, 76*6=456 \u2192 total 5320+456=5776  \nSo numerator is 10976 -5776 =5200  \nThus b=5200/805. Let's simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 5200/5=1040; 805/5=161  \nSo 1040/161 \u22486.46. Not integer.\n\nHmm, so the solution is fractional. So if the question requires integer a and b, then this suggests that there is no such integers, so the recurrence with just a and b may not hold. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows non-integer a and b? The question says \"Can you find a, b such that...\", but didn't specify they have to be integers. Wait, the original problem says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So the user is asking specifically for integers.\n\nTherefore, since the solution requires a and b to be fractions, there are no integer solutions. So the answer would be no, there are no integers a and b such that the recurrence holds. \n\nBut the problem also mentions \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\". Maybe the addition of a constant term c allows integer coefficients? Let me try that.\n\nSo let's consider the recurrence: k\u2099 = a k\u2099\u208b\u2081 + b k\u2099\u208b\u2082 + c\n\nNow, with k\u2087 =76 and k\u2088=224, we need to also use previous terms? Wait, but the problem mentions \"For k7 =76\" and \"For k8=224\". To set up equations for the recurrence with a, b, c, we need three equations, but here only two terms are given. Wait, perhaps the previous terms are known? The problem mentions k\u2087 and k\u2088, so maybe the prior terms like k\u2086 and k\u2085 are known?\n\nWait, actually, in the original problem statement, the user wrote:\n\n\"For k7 = 76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721  \nFor k8 = 224: 224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\"\n\nSo presumably, the previous terms before k7 and k8 are known. For instance, k\u2086 is 21 and k\u2085 is 49? Wait, hold on. Let me think. Wait, the equations given are:\n\nk\u2087 = a\u00d7k\u2086 + b\u00d7k\u2085  \nk\u2088 = a\u00d7k\u2087 + b\u00d7k\u2086\n\nBut to form those equations, they must have known k\u2086 and k\u2085. But the user didn't specify the earlier terms. Wait, actually, in the problem statement above, the equations are written as:\n\nFor k7 =76: 76= a\u00d749 + b\u00d721  \nSo that implies that k\u2086 is 49 and k\u2085 is 21? Because the equation is k\u2087 = a\u00d7k\u2086 + b\u00d7k\u2085. Similarly, for k8=224, it's a\u00d7k\u2087 + b\u00d7k\u2086, so k\u2087 is 76 and k\u2086 is 49. \n\nTherefore, the prior terms are k\u2085=21, k\u2086=49, k\u2087=76, k\u2088=224. So to check a recurrence with a constant term c, we need another equation. Since we have k\u2087 and k\u2088, we can set up two equations for three variables (a, b, c). But we need a third equation. Since the user mentions predicting k\u2081\u2085 and k\u2081\u2086, maybe there are more terms given? Wait, in the problem statement as presented here, only k\u2087 and k\u2088 are given. Wait, maybe the user had prior terms? Because otherwise, with only two equations, we can't solve for three variables. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is part of a larger question where more terms are given? The user's message starts with \"FIBONACCI-LIKE RECURRENCE CHECK\" and then presents the two equations. Maybe in the original problem, there are more terms provided? But in the current context, only k\u2087 and k\u2088 are given, with k\u2086=49 and k\u2085=21. Wait, from the equations, yes, so k\u2085=21, k\u2086=49, k\u2087=76, k\u2088=224.\n\nTherefore, if we want to consider a recurrence with a constant term c, we can use the existing equations for k\u2087 and k\u2088, but we need a third equation. To get the third equation, perhaps k\u2086? Let me see:\n\nSuppose the recurrence is k\u2099 = a k\u2099\u208b\u2081 + b k\u2099\u208b\u2082 + c. Then, to get equations:\n\nFor k\u2087: 76 = a\u00d7k\u2086 + b\u00d7k\u2085 + c  \n=> 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721 + c  \nSimilarly, k\u2088:224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749 + c  \nAdditionally, to get a third equation, perhaps k\u2086? Let's see:\n\nk\u2086 = a\u00d7k\u2085 + b\u00d7k\u2084 + c  \nBut to use this, we need to know k\u2084, which is not provided here. Alternatively, maybe the user assumes that the recurrence starts from some initial terms, so that we can use k\u2085 and k\u2086?\n\nAlternatively, maybe k\u2085 is given by the recurrence as well. Let me think: If the recurrence is supposed to hold for all n \u2265 some number, say n \u22653 or so, then to set up equations, we need to have enough terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is part of a sequence where the prior terms are known, but in the problem as presented here, the user has only given up to k\u2088. To set up the system with a constant term c, we need three equations. Since we can get two from k\u2087 and k\u2088, but need a third. Maybe the user expects us to assume that the recurrence can be applied to earlier terms? For instance, perhaps k\u2086 = a\u00d7k\u2085 + b\u00d7k\u2084 + c. But without knowing k\u2084 or k\u2083, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to only consider the linear recurrence without the constant term, and the user is just checking if there's a mistake in their calculation? Since with the given equations, there is no integer solution, but maybe there was a miscalculation?\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again. Let me re-derive the equations:\n\nGiven k\u2087=76, and assuming the recurrence k\u2087 = a*k\u2086 + b*k\u2085, so if k\u2085 is 21 and k\u2086 is 49:\n\n76 = 49a +21b  \nSimilarly, k\u2088=224 = a*k\u2087 + b*k\u2086 = a*76 + b*49\n\nSo equations:\n\n1) 49a +21b =76  \n2)76a +49b=224  \n\nLet me try solving these equations again.\n\nLet me use substitution. Let me solve equation 1 for a:\n\n49a =76 -21b  \na = (76 -21b)/49\n\nPlug into equation 2:\n\n76*( (76 -21b)/49 ) +49b =224  \nLet me compute 76*(76 -21b)/49 +49b =224\n\nMultiply through by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49b*49 =224*49  \nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term:76*76 = 5776, 76*(-21b)= -1596b  \nSecond term:49b*49=2401b  \nThird term:224*49 = Let's see, 200*49=9800, 24*49=1176 \u2192 total 9800+1176=10976\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b =10976  \nCombine like terms:\n\n(2401b -1596b) =805b  \nSo 5776 +805b =10976  \nSubtract 5776:\n\n805b =10976 -5776 =5200  \nThus b=5200 /805  \nSimplify numerator and denominator by 5: 5200/5=1040, 805/5=161  \nSo b=1040/161 \u22486.46\n\nThen a=(76 -21b)/49  \nPlugging b\u22486.46, but exact fraction:\n\nb=1040/161, so 21b=21*(1040)/161= (21*1040)/161  \nBut 21 and 161: 161=23*7, 21=3*7. So divide numerator and denominator by7:\n\n21/7=3; 161/7=23. Thus:\n\n21b= (3*1040)/23 =3120/23  \nTherefore,\n\na=(76 -3120/23)/49  \nConvert 76 to over 23: 76=76*23/23=1748/23  \nThus:\n\na=(1748/23 -3120/23)/49 = (-1372/23)/49 = (-1372)/(23*49)  \n1372 divided by 49: 49*28=1372  \nThus:\n\na= -28/23 \u2248-1.217\n\nSo the solution is a= -28/23 and b=1040/161. These are fractions, not integers. Therefore, there are no integer solutions for a and b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in forming the equations? Let me check again:\n\nThe user says \"For k7 =76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\". So assuming that k\u2085=21, k\u2086=49, so k\u2087 = a\u00d7k\u2086 + b\u00d7k\u2085, yes, so that equation is correct.\n\nSimilarly, k\u2088= a\u00d7k\u2087 +b\u00d7k\u2086 = a\u00d776 +b\u00d749. That's also correct.\n\nThus the equations are correct. So the conclusion is that there are no integer coefficients a and b that satisfy these equations.\n\nTherefore, if we require integer coefficients, the answer is no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the constant term c? Let me try that.\n\nSuppose the recurrence is k\u2099 = a k\u2099\u208b\u2081 +b k\u2099\u208b\u2082 +c\n\nThen, for k\u2087:76 =a*49 +b*21 +c  \nFor k\u2088:224 =a*76 +b*49 +c  \nBut we need a third equation. Let's assume that the recurrence also holds for k\u2086. Then:\n\nk\u2086=49 =a*k\u2085 +b*k\u2084 +c. But here, k\u2084 is unknown. Alternatively, maybe the recurrence starts later?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the constant term c is the same for all equations, so with three equations (including k\u2086's equation if possible). But since k\u2084 is unknown, perhaps we can set up equations with the three known terms: k\u2085=21, k\u2086=49, k\u2087=76, k\u2088=224.\n\nWait, actually, with k\u2085, k\u2086, k\u2087, k\u2088, we can set up three equations:\n\nFor n=7: k\u2087 = a k\u2086 +b k\u2085 +c  \nFor n=8: k\u2088 =a k\u2087 +b k\u2086 +c  \nFor n=6: k\u2086 =a k\u2085 +b k\u2084 +c  \n\nBut k\u2084 is unknown. However, if we proceed with the first two equations and the third equation using k\u2086 and assuming the recurrence holds for n=6, but since k\u2084 is unknown, that introduces another variable. Thus this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to consider the recurrence starting at n=5? Then to have a consistent system, let's see:\n\nSuppose the recurrence is valid for n\u22655, then:\n\nk\u2085 = a k\u2084 + b k\u2083 +c  \nBut again, too many unknowns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the constant term c can be solved with the two equations from k\u2087 and k\u2088, but there are three variables (a,b,c). Let me see:\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) 49a +21b +c =76  \n2)76a +49b +c =224  \n\nSubtract equation1 from equation2:\n\n(76a -49a) + (49b -21b) + (c -c) =224-76  \n27a +28b =148  \n\nSo equation:27a +28b =148  \n\nNow, with this equation, we can express, say, a in terms of b:\n\n27a =148 -28b  \na=(148 -28b)/27  \n\nNow, substitute back into equation1:\n\n49*( (148 -28b)/27 ) +21b +c =76  \n\nThis gives c in terms of b, but this might not help unless we have another condition.\n\nAlternatively, to see if there are integer solutions, we can attempt to find integers a,b,c such that:\n\n27a +28b =148  \nand then from equation1: c=76 -49a -21b  \n\nWe can attempt to solve 27a +28b =148 for integers a and b.\n\nLet me see if there are integer solutions.\n\nWe can treat this as a Diophantine equation.\n\nThe equation is 27a +28b =148.\n\nLet's find integers a, b.\n\nFirst, check if gcd(27,28) divides 148. gcd(27,28)=1, which divides 148, so solutions exist.\n\nFind one particular solution.\n\nLet me express as:\n\n27a =148 -28b  \nWe can try to find integers b such that 148 -28b is divisible by27.\n\nLet me write 28b \u2261148 mod27\n\n28 mod27=1, so equation becomes:\n\n1*b \u2261148 mod27  \n148 divided by27: 27*5=135, 148-135=13. So 148\u226113 mod27.\n\nThus:\n\nb\u226113 mod27  \nSo general solution: b=13 +27k, where k is integer.\n\nThen, a=(148-28b)/27  \nPlugging b=13+27k:\n\na=(148 -28*(13+27k))/27  \n= (148 -364 -756k)/27  \n= (-216 -756k)/27  \n= -8 -28k  \n\nThus, the solutions are:\n\na= -8 -28k  \nb=13 +27k  \n\nfor integer k.\n\nThus, possible integer solutions.\n\nNow, we can choose k such that a and b are integers, but we also need c=76 -49a -21b to be integer, which it will be as long as a and b are integers.\n\nNow, let's pick k=0:\n\na= -8, b=13. Then c=76 -49*(-8) -21*(13)=76 +392 -273= 76 + 119=195.\n\nThus one solution is a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nCheck if this works with the second equation:\n\n76a +49b +c =76*(-8) +49*13 +195  \n= -608 +637 +195 = (-608+637)=29; 29+195=224. Yes, correct.\n\nSo with a=-8, b=13, c=195, the equations are satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, k=-1:\n\na= -8 -28*(-1)=20  \nb=13+27*(-1)= -14  \nThen c=76 -49*20 -21*(-14)=76 -980 +294= (76+294)=370 -980= -610.\n\nCheck in second equation:\n\n76*20 +49*(-14) + (-610)=1520 -686 -610=1520 -1296=224. Correct.\n\nThus there are infinitely many solutions depending on k.\n\nTherefore, if allowing a constant term c, there are integer solutions. For example, a=-8, b=13, c=195. \n\nHowever, the problem mentions \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\". So the question now is, does this extended recurrence with a constant term allow integer coefficients? The answer is yes. \n\nHowever, the problem's original question is whether there exists a linear recurrence (without constant term) with integer coefficients. Since that requires fractions, the answer is no. But with a constant term, yes. \n\nThe user's question says: \"Can you find a, b such that...\", so initially without c, but then suggests to also try with c. So perhaps the intended answer is that with the constant term, it is possible, but without, it's not.\n\nBut since the user specifically asked first about a and b (without c), and the equations for a and b have no integer solutions, the answer is no. However, if c is allowed, then yes.\n\nBut the problem might be expecting us to realize that without c it's impossible, but with c it's possible, so the minimal recurrence would be with a constant term. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo in the numbers? Let me recheck the problem statement:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"F: For k\u2087 =76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721. \n\nSimilarly for k\u2088=224:224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749. \n\nSo the question is to find integers a and b that satisfy these equations.\"\n\nWait, perhaps in the problem statement, the user is quoting a problem where the original problem is to find a and b (possibly with the assumption that it's a linear recurrence without constant term) but it's impossible, so maybe the actual question is different?\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem was to find a and b such that the sequence follows a linear recurrence of order 2 without constant term, but given the terms k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224, but the equations lead to no solution, hence the problem might be to recognize that or find the minimal polynomial or something else?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking to solve for a and b in the given equations, which have no integer solutions, so the answer is that there are no integers a and b satisfying them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe fractional a and b are acceptable? The problem didn't specify, but since it's common in recurrence relations to have integer coefficients unless stated otherwise.\n\nGiven the equations:\n\n49a +21b =76  \n76a +49b =224  \n\nWe can solve for a and b as fractions.\n\nFrom first equation:\n\n49a =76 -21b  \na=(76 -21b)/49  \n\nSubstitute into second equation:\n\n76*(76 -21b)/49 +49b =224  \n\nMultiply all terms by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49\u00b2b =224*49  \n\nCalculate each term:\n\n76*76 = 5776  \n76*(-21b) = -1596b  \n49\u00b2b =2401b  \n224*49= 10976  \n\nThus:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b =10976  \n5776 + (2401b -1596b) =10976  \n5776 +805b =10976  \n\nSubtract 5776:\n\n805b =10976 -5776 =5200  \n\nThus:\n\nb=5200/805  \n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n5200/5=1040  \n805/5=161  \nThus b=1040/161 \u22486.46\n\nThen a=(76 -21*(1040/161))/49  \n\nCalculate 21*(1040/161)= (21*1040)/161 =21840/161. Divide numerator and denominator by7:\n\n21840 \u00f77=3120; 161 \u00f77=23. So 3120/23.\n\nThus:\n\na=(76 -3120/23)/49  \nConvert 76 to 76*23/23 =1748/23  \nThus:\n\na=(1748/23 -3120/23)/49 = (-1372/23)/49 = (-1372)/(23*49)  \n1372 divided by49 is 28. So -28/23\u2248-1.217\n\nTherefore, the solution is a= -28/23 and b=1040/161. Which are fractions. \n\nSince the problem didn't specify that a and b must be integers, but typically in such recurrence relations without additional context, integer coefficients are expected. Therefore, likely the answer is that there are no integer solutions. \n\nAlternatively, if fractions are allowed, then the solution is a= -28/23 and b=1040/161. But given the problem's context in the question (the user is probably working through a problem expecting integer coefficients), the answer is no, there are no such integers a and b. \n\nTherefore, boxed answer would indicate no solution, but since the problem asks \"Can you find a, b...\", perhaps present the fractional solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the problem setup? Let me verify with the given numbers:\n\nIf k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224,\n\nAssuming a linear recurrence relation k\u2099 = a k\u2099\u208b\u2081 + b k\u2099\u208b\u2082,\n\nThen:\n\nFor n=7:76 =a*49 +b*21  \nFor n=8:224 =a*76 +b*49  \n\nThese are the two equations given. Solving them gives fractional coefficients, so no integer solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, like different terms? For example, if k8 was 196 instead of 224, then the equations would be:\n\n49a +21b=76  \n76a +49b=196  \n\nThen solving:\n\nMultiply first equation by 49, second by21:\n\n49*49a +49*21b =49*76  \n76*21a +49*21b=21*196  \n\nSubtract first from second:\n\n(76*21a -49\u00b2a) =21*196 -49*76  \na*(1596 -2401)=4116 -3724  \na*(-805)=392  \na= -392/805= -56/115\u2248-0.487\n\nNot integer.\n\nAlternatively, different numbers. Since the problem as given has no integer solution, the answer is that there are no integer a and b.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\text{No solution exists with integer coefficients.}}\n</think>\n\nGiven the problem to find integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that the recurrence relation \\(k_n = a \\cdot k_{n-1} + b \\cdot k_{n-2}\\) holds for the terms \\(k_5 = 21\\), \\(k_6 = 49\\), \\(k_7 = 76\\), and \\(k_8 = 224\\), we set up the following equations based on the given terms:\n\n1.
