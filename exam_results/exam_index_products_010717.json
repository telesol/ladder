They are presumably defined as something maybe like a sequence or product pattern? The text is \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\" then it states:\n- Observed: \n   - k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n   - k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n- Hypothesis: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n- Check:\n    1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n    2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n    3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n    4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n    5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo: \"k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\". The question is:\n\"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nWe have keys for indices: 2,3,5,7,8,9,11,12? Actually the observed ones are: k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. But the check only gives numbers for some of them.\n\nLet's re-read carefully what we have:\n\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\nThus it seems they are saying: For key numbers, sometimes the key is given by f(n)*n + g(n). They want to calculate f(n) for each key. The check gives:\n\nFor k7:\nk7 should be of form ? * 7 + ?. They gave \"76/7 = 10.86\" which is not integer. For k8, they got 224/8 = 28, so f(8)=28 and g(n) maybe? But then for k11: 1155/11 = 105, so f(11)=105.\n\nBut wait, the pattern: \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\" where f(n) is calculated from dividing k(n) by n (if it yields integer) presumably. But we only have two keys with integer division: k8 and k11 are such that k8/8=28 and k11/11=105.\n\nMaybe the pattern for all others? It says \"Calculate f(n) for each key\". So maybe f(2), f(3), f(5), f(7), etc. But we don't have actual values of keys? We only have these checks: For k5, k12, etc. Wait, re-read:\n\nIt states:\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\nMaybe the pattern is: For some indices, f(n) equals something like:\nf(2) for k2? But we don't have any given numbers aside from the ones used in multiplication.\n\nWe have k5 is defined as k2 \u00d7 k3. That means that if we assume the keys follow a form: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then k5 = 5*f(5) + g(5). But also equals k2*k3 = (2*f(2)+g(2))*(3*f(3)+g(3)). This might be used to derive some pattern.\n\nWe see k12 is defined as: k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5, i.e. 12 * f(8)*? Wait, let's re-read that: \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\", maybe it means that when index 12, the formula is multiplied by 12 and then subtract 5.\n\nThe provided checks:\n- For n=7: they computed something with 76; for n=8: got 224; for n=9: got 467; for n=11: got 1155; for n=12: got 2683. They check if dividing by the index gives an integer result (maybe that's f(n)). For k7, 76/7 \u2248 10.86 is not an integer, so it doesn't fit the pattern of being just multiple of n? But for k8, 224/8=28 exactly, so f(8)=28. For k11, 1155/11=105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\n\nSo if we assume that k_n = n*f(n) + g(n), then for n=8 and n=11, g(n) must be 0 (if they are exactly multiples of n). But is that the pattern? The statement \"f(n) \u00d7 n\" suggests maybe f(n) is obtained by dividing k_n by n. For keys where it divides evenly, that quotient gives f(n).\n\nThen our job: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly the answer should be:\n- For n=2, f(2)=?\n- For n=3, f(3)=?\n- For n=5, f(5)=?\n- For n=7, f(7)=? possibly from 76/7 which is not integer? But maybe we consider rounding? The check for k7: 76/7 \u2248 10.857, so not integer.\n- For n=8, f(8)=28 exactly (given).\n- For n=9, 467/9 \u2248 51.8889, not an integer.\n- For n=11, f(11)=105 exactly.\n- For n=12, 2683/12 is not an integer.\n\nBut then what are the actual k-values? They must be computed from some pattern? The text \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\" might indicate that there's a sequence defined by something like: k1 = some base? But we don't see k1, only keys 2,3,5,7,8,9,11,12. They mention k2, k3 appear in the product for k5, so maybe the sequence is defined recursively or with multiplicative pattern?\n\nThe text \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" suggests that maybe for prime indices? But 5 is prime, and then k7 maybe equals something times 7 plus something? However, they mention \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\". So index 12 uses its own index factor 12.\n\nMaybe the pattern: \n- For composite numbers like 4 or 6 or 10, it might follow a product rule. But we only have keys for 2,3,5,7,8,9,11,12.\n- k8 and k11 are particularly interesting because they yield integer quotients when divided by the index.\n\nI suspect the intended answer is to derive f(n) values from those observations:\nFor n=8: f(8)=224/8 = 28.\nFor n=11: f(11)=1155/11 = 105.\nAnd then maybe for others, f(n) is given by (k_n)/n if it's divisible? But we only have approximate values.\n\nWe need to decide how to answer this. The question: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" It might require using the known relationships:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. And maybe we assume that k2, k3 follow a similar pattern with their own indices? But we don't have actual values.\n\nWait, let's re-read the text carefully:\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\nMaybe the keys are defined in a pattern where sometimes it is simply f(n) * n, with no remainder (g(n)=0), and sometimes not.\n\nThus f(2)? How to compute? We don't have explicit value for k2. But maybe we can infer from k5 = k2*k3.\nWe might assume that keys follow a pattern like: For prime numbers n, maybe f(n) equals something based on n?\nMaybe the sequence is: k1, k2, k3, ... but only k2 and k3 are used for product in k5. Possibly k2 and k3 themselves are of form: f(2)*2 + g(2) and f(3)*3+g(3). If we had values of k2 and k3? They are not provided.\n\nMaybe we can deduce them from the ones given? For instance, if k8 = 28*8 then maybe k8=224. And k11=105*11 so k11=1155.\nThen what is k12? k12 = k8 * 12 - 5 = 224 * 12 - 5 = 2688 - 5 = 2683, which matches the observation.\n\nMaybe we have a sequence: \nk2, k3, k4, ... but only some indices are mentioned. But then k5 = k2*k3 means k5 is product of two earlier keys. That suggests maybe for composite numbers, the key is the product of the keys corresponding to its prime factors? Not sure.\n\nMaybe the idea: f(n) = (k_n - g(n))/n where sometimes g(n)=0. The check numbers:\nFor n=7, k7 \u2248 76, so f(7) would be approximately 10.857.\nFor n=8, k8 exactly gives 28 as integer.\nFor n=9, k9 approximates to 467/9 \u2248 51.888...\nFor n=11, f(11)=105 exactly.\nFor n=12, it's not divisible by 12 cleanly.\n\nSo the answer might be:\n- For n=7: f(7) \u2248 10.857 (if we take k7 = 76).\n- For n=8: f(8) = 28.\n- For n=9: f(9) \u2248 51.8889.\n- For n=11: f(11) = 105.\n- For n=12: f(12) is not an integer.\n\nBut wait, what about k2 and k3? Possibly they are given by some known formula as well:\nMaybe we can use the relationship from k5: k5 = k2 * k3. If we assume k2 and k3 themselves follow pattern k_n = n*f(n) + g(n), then k5 would be 5f(5)+g(5). But we don't know them.\n\nPerhaps I need to re-read the question \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" It might mean: given that we observed some keys, calculate f(n)=k_n/n when it divides evenly.\n\nWe have data points:\nn=7: k7/7 = 76/7 = 10.8571 (not integer).\nn=8: k8/8 = 224/8 = 28.\nn=9: k9/9 = 467/9 \u2248 51.8889.\nn=11: k11/11 = 1155/11 = 105.\nn=12: k12/12 = (k8*12 - 5)/12 = (224*12-5)/12 = (2683)/12 \u2248 223.5833.\n\nAlso we have from observation that maybe for prime indices, f(n) might be something like: For n=2 and n=3, perhaps f(2)=? f(3)=?\n\nMaybe the pattern is not consistent; only some keys are multiples of the index exactly.\nMaybe the answer should say: The observed values for f(n) (when defined as k_n/n if integer) are:\n- f(7) ~ 10.8571 (approx)\n- f(8) = 28\n- f(9) ~ 51.8889 (approx)\n- f(11)=105.\nAnd then mention that the pattern might involve prime factorization of indices, etc.\n\nHowever, it's possible that there is an underlying rule for generating these numbers such as k_n = n * f(n) + g(n) where f(n) follows a certain recursion. For instance: k5 = k2*k3, so if k2 = 2f(2)+g(2) and k3=3f(3)+g(3), maybe that implies something about f(2) and f(3). But without additional info, we cannot solve.\n\nMaybe the intended answer is simply: \nFor n=7: f(7)=floor(76/7) = 10 with a remainder of 6 (if rounding down).\nFor n=8: f(8)=28 exactly.\nFor n=9: f(9)=floor(467/9)=51 remainder 8.\nFor n=11: f(11)=105 exactly.\nFor n=1,2,3 maybe similar.\n\nBut the question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" might refer to a specific pattern that we haven't identified. The keys given in the checks are k7, k8, k9, k11, and k12. So perhaps answer: \n- For 7, if k7=76 then f(7)=76/7 = 10.8571...\n- For 8, f(8)=224/8=28.\n- For 9, f(9)=467/9\u224851.8889...\n- For 11, f(11)=1155/11=105.\n- For 12, k12=2683 so f(12)=2683/12\u2248223.5833.\n\nBut that seems too trivial: it's just dividing by the index.\n\nMaybe there is a pattern in these quotients: They seem to be:\nn=7: \u224810.8571\nn=8: 28\nn=9: \u224851.8889\nn=11: 105\n\nLet me try to see if they are related to something like n choose something? For instance, 28 is binomial coefficient (8 choose 2)? Actually, C(8,2)=28. And 10.8571 for n=7 might be related to some combination? Also 51.8889 for n=9, not a common number.\n105 for n=11: that's C(11,2) is 55, C(11,3)=165, so no.\n\nMaybe these numbers are approximations from a recursive formula?\n\nWait maybe the idea \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN\" suggests that the index (like 5 in k5 equals product of indices 2 and 3) might be used to compute f(n). For n=12: They computed f(12) indirectly as (k8 * 12 - 5)/12. But since we know k8 = 28*8, then f(12)= (224*12-5)/12 = (2688-5)/12 = 2683/12 which is not an integer.\n\nMaybe the answer should mention that the pattern of including the index in the formula happens only for certain indices (like 7? But k7 didn't include its own factor cleanly, since it's 76 instead of a multiple of 7). For n=8 and n=11, the keys are multiples of the index.\n\nSo possibly we conclude: \nFor n = 2,3,5,... if the key is given by a pure multiplication with f(n), then f(8)=28 and f(11)=105. For other indices, there might be an additive constant g(n). The observed quotient for k7 is approximately 10.8571, which suggests that if we define f(n) as the nearest integer to k_n/n, then f(7)=11 might be a candidate? But then 11*7 =77, not 76.\n\nMaybe we can solve: Let k_n = n*f(n)+g(n). For those cases where it divides evenly (g=0), then f(n) is exactly the quotient. So for n=8 and n=11, we have exact values.\nFor others like n=7 and n=9 and n=12, g(n) \u2260 0.\n\nBut the question \"Calculate f(n)\" suggests that maybe they want to extract the coefficient that multiplies the index from each key's expression. So perhaps:\n- For k2: if we had its value? Possibly k2 = 4 (if we assume it starts with 1, then next is 4, etc) but not sure.\n- For k3: maybe k3=9?\n- Then k5 would be 4*9=36, but they gave k7 as 76 in the check for n=7. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined by something like k_n = (n choose 2) + ... Actually, note that for n=8, f(8)=28 which equals C(8,2). For n=11, 105 equals C(11,2)? Let's check: C(11,2)=55, not 105. Wait, what is 105? C(11,3)=165, C(11,4)=330... Actually, 105 is a binomial coefficient for something else maybe: C(15,2)=105 but that doesn't involve 11.\nMaybe f(n) are triangular numbers sometimes.\n\n28 is the 7th triangular number (but 28 is the 7th triangular number actually T7=28). And 105 is the 14th triangular number? Actually T14=105. So maybe there's a pattern: for n=8, f(8)=T7; for n=11, f(11)=T14. Then what about k7 ~76. The 10th triangular number T10 =55, and 11th T11=66, not matching.\n\nLet me check: T(n) = n(n+1)/2.\nFor n=8, if we take T7 = 28 then that fits.\nFor n=11, if we take T14 = 105 then that fits.\nMaybe for a general prime index p, f(p)=T((p-1)/? Possibly f(11)=T? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is: k_n = n*(some function of n) + remainder, and sometimes the function equals triangular numbers. \nFor instance:\nn=8 gives 28 = T7.\nn=11 gives 105 = T14.\nMaybe for composite numbers like 12, the pattern doesn't yield a neat triangular number.\n\nI might answer: \"Based on the checks provided, when k_n divides evenly by n (i.e., g(n)=0), we can extract f(n) directly. For example, for n=8 and n=11, we get f(8)=224/8 = 28 and f(11)=1155/11 =105. Meanwhile, for indices such as 7,9,12, the division yields non-integer results (approximately 10.86, 51.89, and 223.58 respectively), suggesting that in these cases, an additive term g(n) is present.\"\n\nBut then \"calculate f(n)\" might simply be: \nf(2)=?; f(3)=?; f(5)=?; f(7) = 76/7 \u2248 10.8571; f(8)=28; f(9)=467/9 \u2248 51.8889; f(11)=105; f(12)=(2683)/12\u2248223.5833.\n\nI think the answer should list these values, possibly rounded to a certain precision if necessary, and note that in some cases they are not integers indicating a non-zero remainder g(n).\n\nMaybe I'll assume k2 and k3 have similar structure? Possibly we could solve for them using k5 = k2*k3. If we let k2 = 2f(2) + g(2) and k3= 3f(3)+g(3), then k5 should equal (2f(2)+g(2))*(3f(3)+g(3)). But without further info, we can't determine.\n\nMaybe the intended keys are just the ones given in the check: 7,8,9,11,12. So I'll answer:\n\nGiven that k_n = n f(n) + g(n), we find:\n- For n=7, k7 = 76, so dividing by 7 gives f(7) \u2248 10.8571 (with a remainder of approximately 6).\n- For n=8, k8 = 224, and since 224/8 = 28 exactly, we have f(8)=28.\n- For n=9, k9 = 467, so f(9) \u2248 51.8889 with a remainder of about 8.\n- For n=11, k11 = 1155, hence f(11)=1155/11=105 exactly.\n- For n=12, k12 = 2683, which gives f(12) \u2248 223.5833.\n\nThus, the computed values for f(n) are:\nn:   7         8          9           11          12\nf(n):\u224810.8571, 28,       \u224851.8889,   105,        \u2248223.5833\n\nI can also mention that the exact values for keys where division is not integer indicate that f(n) is only an integer when there's no additive constant.\n\nMaybe I'll reframe answer: \"Assuming k_n = n * f(n) + g(n), then by checking the provided key computations, we find that:\n\nk7 = 76 gives f(7)=10.8571 (if you require a non-integer, else possibly rounding to 11 if appropriate),\nk8 = 224 gives f(8)=28 exactly,\nk9 = 467 gives f(9)=51.8889 approximately,\nk11 =1155 gives f(11)=105 exactly,\nk12 =2683 gives f(12)\u2248223.5833.\n\nIt appears that for n=8 and n=11 the keys are exact multiples of n, while for other indices an additive term is present.\"\n\nI worry if maybe the intended pattern is different: \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN\" might be a hint to factor something like: k_n = (n choose 2) * f(n)? But then for n=8, (8 choose 2)=28 which equals f(8). And for n=11, (11 choose 2)=55 which is not 105. 105/55 is not an integer though it's 21/11? Actually 105/55 = 1.909... So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is: k_n = product of indices in some sequence plus n. For instance, k7=2*3+? Not sure.\n\nk5 = k2*k3 might indicate that f(2) and f(3) are factors leading to 76 when multiplied with appropriate coefficients. Without more context, it's hard to deduce a pattern.\n\nI think I'll provide the answer as: \"f(7)=10.8571, f(8)=28, f(9)=51.8889, f(11)=105, and f(12)\u2248223.5833.\"\n\nI should also note that these values were computed by dividing the given key numbers by their corresponding indices.\n\nMaybe I'll write: \"If we assume k_n = n * f(n) + g(n), then for each index where k_n is an exact multiple of n, f(n)=k_n/n. In our case:\n- For n=8, since k_8=224, we have f(8)=224/8=28.\n- For n=11, k_11=1155, so f(11)=1155/11=105.\nFor other indices such as 7,9,12, the division does not yield an integer, indicating a nonzero g(n). Specifically,\nf(7)=76/7\u224810.8571,\nf(9)=467/9\u224851.8889,\nf(12)=2683/12\u2248223.5833.\nThus, these are the computed values of f(n) for the given keys.\"\n\nI'll answer accordingly.\n\nGiven that instructions say \"Calculate f(n)\" likely means: \"Find the function f such that k_n = n * f(n) + g(n)\". I can state: Let k_n be given by the product pattern as observed. Then we can express f(n) = (k_n - g(n))/n. For indices where g(n)=0, this simplifies to f(n)=k_n/n.\n\nI should then present the computed values as above.\n\nHowever, maybe there's more structure: \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN\" might be a title of a puzzle. Possibly each key is built from its index digits multiplied together plus something. For instance:\n- k2: maybe 2^? Not sure.\n\nMaybe I'll check: The given checks are for n=7,8,9,11,12.\nk7=76, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, k12=2683.\nDivide each by its index:\n76/7 \u224810.8571,\n224/8 =28,\n467/9 \u224851.8889,\n1155/11=105,\n2683/12\u2248223.5833.\nMaybe these quotients are all close to triangular numbers? 10.8571 is not triangular though.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is: f(n) equals the number of ways to choose something from n-... Actually, note that 28 is C(8,2). And 105 equals C(11,2)? Wait, check: C(11,2)=55, so not. But 105 is C(15,2)=105, but that doesn't relate to 11.\n\nMaybe they are binomial coefficients with different indices:\nFor n=7: maybe f(7)=C(8,3) =56? That's too high.\nOr f(7)=C(8,1)+something? Not sure.\n\nI can also try differences:\nf(8)=28,\nf(11)=105,\nDifference 77; ratio of indices: (11-8=3)? Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is: f(n) = (n+1 choose something). For n=8, 9 choose something? Unclear.\n\nMaybe I should simply answer with the division as computed. Without further context, that's likely what is expected.\n\nI'll now produce final answer accordingly.</think>One acceptable way to \u201cread\u2010off\u201d f(n) is to assume that each key has the form\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = n \u00b7 f(n) + g(n)\n\nso that when k\u2099 happens to be an exact multiple of n (that is, when g(n)=0) we may simply take\n\n\u2003\u2003f(n) = k\u2099/n.\n\nIn our \u201cindex\u2010product pattern\u201d the keys for several indices were given. For example, one check showed that\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2087 = 76.\n\nDividing by 7 gives\n\n\u2003\u2003f(7) = 76/7 \u2248 10.8571.\n\nAnother check was made for n = 8. Since\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2088 = 224,\n\nand 224 divides evenly by 8 we have\n\n\u2003\u2003f(8) = 224/8 = 28.\n\nA third example is n = 9, where the key was\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2089 = 467.\nThen\n\u2003\u2003f(9) = 467/9 \u2248 51.8889.\n\nSimilarly, for n = 11 one finds\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 1155\u2003\u27f9\u2003f(11)=1155/11 = 105,\n\nand finally, for n = 12 we have\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 2683\u2003\u27f9\u2003f(12) \u2248 2683/12 \u2248 223.5833.\n\nThus one acceptable answer is to state that the \u201cmultipliers\u201d f(n) (when the key happens to be exactly divisible by n) are given by\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003for n = 7:\u2003f(7) \u2248 10.8571\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003for n = 8:\u2003f(8) = 28\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003for n = 9:\u2003f(9) \u2248 51.8889\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003for n = 11: f(11) = 105\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003for n = 12: f(12) \u2248 223.5833\n\nOf course, in cases where k\u2099 is not an exact multiple of n (that is, when g(n) \u2260 0) the \u201ctrue\u201d f(n) would be defined by\n\u2003\u2003f(n) = [k\u2099 \u2013 g(n)]/n,\nbut with the data given it is natural to take f(n)=k\u2099/n for those indices where division yields an integer.\n\nAny answer which shows that, for example,\n\u2003\u2003224 = 8\u00b728\u2003and\u20031155 = 11\u00b7105\n(and similarly gives the other values by dividing k\u2099 by n) is correct.",
