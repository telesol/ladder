It appears that the keys, maybe they are part of something like product formulas.\n\nI try to interpret the provided observations.\n\nLet's denote k_i as some numbers, and it seems we have examples:\n\n- For index 2,3,5 maybe? There is mention \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\". But then text: \"indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no\" Possibly an error in reading? The provided statement: \n   \"OBSERVED:\n    - k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\"\nMaybe it means that the key for index 5 equals to the product of keys for indices 2 and 3. But then they say \"k8= ...\", etc.\n\nWait: It says:\n\"OBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\"\n\nI think the pattern analysis is trying to find a formula of the form: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) where sometimes the index n appears multiplied by something, and possibly plus something else.\n\nThey mention \"CHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\n\nSo it appears that for index n, if we assume the formula k_n = f(n) * n + g(n), then the computed quotient (k_n)/n equals to something sometimes integer, and not always.\n\nFor instance: For k8: We see 224/8 = 28. So maybe f(8)=28, and then what's g(8)? Possibly if we set up equation: k_8 = 28*8 + g(8), but the quotient 224/8 is exactly 28. Wait, that would be 224 = 28 * 8, so then g(8) must equal 0? But maybe not.\n\nWait, let me re-read: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nI believe we are given some examples with actual values of keys:\n- k7 = 76 (maybe? Because they do \"k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7\")\n- k8 = 224\n- k9 = 467\n- k11 = 1155\n- k12 = 2683\n\nSo the observed keys: \nk7 = 76, k8 = 224, k9 = 467, k11 = 1155, k12 = 2683.\nAnd they are checking if these keys can be written in the form: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). They already computed some quotient:\n\nFor n=7: 76/7 \u2248 10.857... not integer.\nn=8: 224/8 = 28 exactly, so that's a candidate for f(8).\nn=9: 467/9 \u2248 51.888... not an integer.\nn=11: 1155/11 = 105 exactly, so candidate f(11) = 105.\nn=12: 2683/12 is not integer; but they observed that k_12 equals k8 * 12 - 5, i.e., 224*12 - 5.\n\nSo then maybe the pattern is: for some indices n, the quotient (k_n)/n is an integer, and f(n) equals that integer. And g(n)=0 in those cases.\n\nThen the question \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly means: Given the formula k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), what is f(7), f(8), f(9), f(11), f(12)? But we have some values are not clean; they are decimals. They provided approximations.\n\nThe pattern might be that for indices that satisfy certain conditions, the quotient (k_n)/n is an integer and it equals to something like: 76/7 \u2248 10.857... maybe a rounding? But then k8 gives exactly 28, k11 gives exactly 105.\n\nI recall the phrase \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\" might be referring to something like the \"Key Index Product Problem\", which is a puzzle sometimes found on sites like puzzling.stackexchange.com. There's an interesting sequence of numbers called \"keys\" that follow patterns. Possibly it's from an \"index product puzzle\" where you multiply certain indices together, etc.\n\nWe see: k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 maybe? But then they said \"indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no\". I'm not sure.\n\nWait, look at the provided expressions:\n- For index 7: k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? so they divide k7 by 7: (76/7) which equals approximately 10.8571. So maybe f(7)=10.8571 but then it's not an integer.\nBut for n=8, we got exactly 28, so that might be the pattern f(8)=28.\n\nFor n=11, k11 = 1155 and dividing by 11 gives 105 exactly.\nSo maybe the function f(n) is defined only when k_n mod n == 0. So far, for n=8 and n=11, it's integer: 28 and 105 respectively.\n\nMaybe we can try to see if any pattern emerges from these integer values.\n\n28, 105... differences? \n- For index 7, quotient is not an integer.\n- For index 9, quotient is not an integer.\n- For index 12, quotient is not an integer either.\n\nBut then the observation \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" with f(8)=28.\nMaybe we can express them in terms of other keys? For instance, k11 = 105. And 105 might be derived from something like: maybe it's 15*7 or something. But what is special about 8 and 11? Possibly they are prime numbers (11 is prime) and 8 is not.\n\nAlternatively, could it be that f(n)= (k_n - g(n))/n, but then we don't know g(n). Possibly there is some pattern in the \"g(n)\" terms?\n\nMaybe consider k12 = k8 * 12 -5. That means 2683 = 224*12 - 5, so that fits with the formula: f(12)*12 + g(12) but here if we let f(12)=k8, then 224*12 gives 2688, and subtracting 5 yields 2683, so that means g(12) = -5. But then for k11=1155=105*11+0? Yes.\n\nI suspect the pattern might be: For some indices n that are prime or have certain properties, f(n)= (k_n)/n if g(n)=0; otherwise, f(n)= something like (k_{index}+some constant)/n. \n\nMaybe the question is asking: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" And then list them:\n\nFor index 7: f(7) = k7 / 7 = 76/7 \u2248 10.8571, which might be approximated as 11 maybe? But no.\n\nBut check the text: \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713\" means f(8)=28 exactly.\n\"k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\". So maybe f(9) is not an integer, so pattern not holds.\n\n\"k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105\" so f(11)=105 exactly.\n\"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". So perhaps in that case, if we express it as: k12 = (k8)*12 - 5, then the coefficient of 12 is k8 which equals 28? That would be 28*12 =336, not matching.\nWait, check: \"k8\u00d712-5\" means multiply k8 by 12 and subtract 5. But k8=224. Then 224*12 =2688, minus 5 gives 2683, which is k12. So that fits.\n\nMaybe f(12) equals something like (k8)? But then plus a constant -5? Let's set up: k12 = ?\u00d712 + ?. And they suggest if you try to see it as f(n)*n+g(n), for n=12, the quotient is not integer because 2683/12 \u2260 an integer. However, we can express it in terms of a known key: 224*12 -5. That implies that if we let f(12)= k8 then g(12) = -5. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nI suspect the puzzle might be part of a series where keys are defined recursively with some multiplication pattern or addition constant based on index properties, and sometimes one key is expressed in terms of another.\n\nMaybe the general form they want: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) where:\n- For indices where n divides k_n exactly, then g(n)=0, so f(n) = k_n/n.\n- When not divisible exactly, maybe g(n) is chosen to force a relation with another key.\n\nWe have computed:\nFor n=7: 76/7 \u2260 integer, so if we try to represent it in that form we get f(7)= floor? It might be best represented as f(7)=10 and remainder something. But the pattern \"f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)\" is not clear.\n\nI recall a puzzle on puzzling SE about \"Key Index Product\" which involved keys of houses or similar.\n\nLet me try to see if I can infer any formula from these numbers:\nk2, k3, k5 are mentioned but we don't have their values. We know: k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. That might be a relation.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined recursively by: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) where\n- if n is prime, then maybe g(n)=0? Because for 11 (which is prime), we got that.\n- But 7 is prime and does not give an integer quotient. So not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule depends on whether index divides something or pattern of digits.\n\nI wonder if these keys correspond to a product series such as: k_n = n! + something? But for 8: 8! is huge though.\n\nWait, let's check: 7! =5040 but k7=76 is far too small.\nMaybe it's like \"key\" numbers from the \"Index Product Puzzle\", which are not factorial.\n\nI recall a puzzle \"Key, index, product, pattern\" sometimes posted online where the answer was to find missing keys and note that if you multiply certain indices you get some key plus something. I'm trying to recall but uncertain.\n\nMaybe we can try: f(n) is computed as integer part of (k_n/n)? But then for k8, 224/8=28 exactly; for k11, 1155/11=105 exactly.\nFor others it's not an integer. So maybe they want us to compute the quotient and note which ones are integers.\n\nSo answer:\nf(7)=76/7 \u2248 10.857\nf(8)=224/8 = 28 (exact)\nf(9)=467/9 \u2248 51.888...\nf(11)=1155/11 = 105 (exact)\nf(12) can be represented in a different way: k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5, so if we set that equal to f(12)*12 + g(12), then one possibility is f(12) = ? It doesn't divide evenly though.\n\nMaybe the question \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" means: For indices 7,8,9,11,12, what are the resulting values of f(n) when you divide k_n by n if possible? That yields:\n- f(7)=76/7 (which is not an integer)\n- f(8)=224/8=28\n- f(9)=467/9 (not integer)\n- f(11)=1155/11=105\n- f(12)=? Possibly if we write it as 2683/12, which simplifies to 223.583... but then the observation \"k8\u00d712-5\" gives a neat pattern: maybe we define f(12) = k8 (which is 224) and then subtract 5 constant offset. But that doesn't align with form f(n)*n + g(n).\n\nWait, maybe the intended interpretation is: There exists functions f(n) and g(n) such that for every index n, k_n equals f(n)*n + g(n). In some cases, f(n) turns out to be an integer when you do k_n / n. And in those cases, it appears to follow a pattern.\n\nFor n=8: 224/8 = 28.\nFor n=11: 1155/11 = 105.\nMaybe for others:\nFor n=2,3,5 we might have similar relationships. But they are not given explicitly.\n\nI think I'll assume that the answer is:\n- f(7) \u2248 10.857\n- f(8) = 28 exactly.\n- f(9) \u2248 51.889 (if computed as 467/9).\n- f(11) = 105 exactly.\n- f(12) from the given formula k8\u00d712 -5, we can write it as 224*12 -5 = 2683. But if expressed in the form f(n)*n + g(n), then one might choose f(12)=? Possibly f(12)=223 with remainder 11/12? Let's check: 223*12=2676, plus what constant gives 2683? That would be +7, but not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we set f(12) = k8 and then g(12) = -5. But that doesn't match the form \"f(n)*n\" since f(n)*n should be an integer multiple of n. Let's try: if k12 = 2683, and we want to express it as f(12)*12 + g(12), maybe choose f(12)=223 (since 223*12=2676) then g(12)=7. But 223 is not obviously related to any other key.\n\nWait, what does \"sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula\" mean? Possibly that for some keys, like k8 and k11, you can recover them by multiplying a function of the index with the index. And maybe f(n) is defined as: \n- if n=7, then f(7)=floor(76/7)? But 76/7 is not an integer.\n- if n=8, then f(8)=28 exactly.\n- if n=9, then f(9)=467/9 which is not integer.\n- if n=11, then f(11)=105 exactly.\n- if n=12, then maybe f(12)=? \nMaybe the pattern is that when n is composite (like 4,6,8,12) sometimes you can factor out a previous key. For instance, k12 = k8*12 -5 indicates that for 12, f(12) equals something like k8 and g(n) equals -5.\n\nI think the intended answer might be: \nf(7)=76/7 \u2248 10.857; f(8)=28; f(9)=467/9 \u2248 51.889; f(11)=105; f(12)=k8, i.e., 224 when multiplied by 12 and then adjusted with a constant g(12)=-5.\n\nBut that doesn't look nice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can determine f(n) exactly from the pattern in indices: maybe they are defined as follows:\nFor n=2,3,5: k_n = some product.\nFor n=7, it's 76, so f(7)=76/7 which is not an integer, so maybe g(7)=? That is messy.\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking. The question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" likely expects the answer:\nf(2)=?, f(3)=?, etc.\nBut we are only given keys 7,8,9,11,12 and possibly others like k5 = k2 * k3.\n\nI might try to guess that the function f(n) is defined by: \nf(n)= (k_n - g(n))/n.\nAnd for indices where n divides k_n exactly, then g(n)=0. That happens for n=8 and 11.\nFor n=7, maybe f(7)=76/7 which doesn't simplify.\nFor n=9, f(9)=467/9.\nFor n=12, we have an alternative representation: 2683 = 224*12 -5, so if you compare with the form f(n)*n + g(n), one possibility is to choose f(12) = k8 (which is 224) and then subtract 5 afterwards.\n\nIt might be that f(n) is defined piecewise depending on n. Possibly:\n- If n=8 or 11, then f(n)= k_n / n.\n- Otherwise, if there's a relation with another key, like n=12: f(12)= k8 and then g(12)= -5.\n\nI could answer: \nFor key #7: f(7) = 76/7 \u2248 10.857\nFor key #8: f(8) = 28 exactly.\nFor key #9: f(9) = 467/9 \u2248 51.889\nFor key #11: f(11) = 105 exactly.\nFor key #12: Although 2683/12 is not an integer, we can express k12 as (k8\u00d712 - 5), implying a pattern where the \"coefficient\" function takes on the value of another key (specifically k8).\n\nMaybe that's all.\n\nI might answer:\n\nAnswer:\nWe have keys k7 = 76, k8 = 224, k9 = 467, k11 = 1155, and k12 = 2683.\nAssuming each key can be written in the form f(n)*n + g(n), we find:\n- For n=8: 224/8 = 28, so f(8)=28 and g(8)=0.\n- For n=11: 1155/11 = 105, so f(11)=105 and g(11)=0.\nFor the others:\n- k7 = 76 gives f(7) \u2248 10.857 (if we insist on that form).\n- k9 = 467 gives f(9) \u2248 51.889.\n- k12 can also be written as k8\u00d712 -5, so one representation is f(12)=224 and g(12)=-5.\n\nThus the values of f(n) are:\nf(7) = 76/7,\nf(8) = 28,\nf(9) = 467/9,\nf(11) = 105,\nand for n=12, one representation is f(12)=224 (with an offset term -5).\n\nI can present that as answer.\n\nHowever, it's not clear if the question expects a general formula or just these computed values. The phrasing \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" suggests: given k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), compute f(n)=? So answer:\n\nf(7) = 76/7,\nf(8) = 224/8 = 28,\nf(9) = 467/9,\nf(11) = 1155/11 = 105,\nand k12 can be expressed as 2683 = (k8)*12 -5, which shows that f(12)=? Possibly f(12) is not given by a simple division but rather by an expression involving another key.\n\nI think I'll answer with the computed values and note that for some keys, the quotient isn't an integer.\n\nI will now produce my final answer in plain text.</think>One acceptable answer was to show that if you write\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n)\n\nthen (when possible) one may \u201cread off\u201d f(n) as k\u2099/n.
