  "response": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here where I need to check if a certain sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence. Specifically, the question is whether each term k_n can be expressed as a linear combination of the two previous terms, like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}. They also mention maybe adding a constant c, but the main focus is on the linear recurrence without the constant first. \n\nThe given terms are k7 = 76 and k8 = 224, and they want to know if there exist integers a and b such that these equations hold:\n\nFor k7 = 76: 76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224: 224 = 76a + 49b\n\nHmm, okay. Let me start by writing these equations down more clearly. \n\nFirst equation:\n49a + 21b = 76\n\nSecond equation:\n76a + 49b = 224\n\nI need to solve for a and b here. Since they are asking for integer solutions, maybe I can use some algebraic methods like substitution or elimination. Let me see.\n\nLet me first label the equations for clarity.\n\nEquation 1: 49a + 21b = 76\n\nEquation 2: 76a + 49b = 224\n\nHmm, maybe using the elimination method here. Let's see. If I can multiply each equation by some factor so that the coefficients of one of the variables are the same (or negatives), then I can subtract or add the equations to eliminate that variable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the other. Let me try substitution first.\n\nFrom Equation 1: Let's solve for a in terms of b.\n\n49a = 76 - 21b\n\nSo, a = (76 - 21b)/49\n\nHmm, but that might lead to fractions. Let me see if plugging this into Equation 2 would work.\n\nSubstituting a into Equation 2:\n\n76*( (76 - 21b)/49 ) + 49b = 224\n\nHmm, that looks a bit messy. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 76*(76 - 21b)/49:\n\nLet me denote the first term as Term1 = 76*(76 -21b)/49\n\nTerm1 = (76*76)/49 - (76*21b)/49\n\nSimilarly, Term1 = (5776)/49 - (1596b)/49\n\nThen Term1 + 49b = 224\n\nSo:\n\n(5776)/49 - (1596b)/49 + 49b = 224\n\nLet me combine the terms with b:\n\nFirst, note that 49b can be written as (49b * 49)/49 to have a common denominator? Wait, maybe better to multiply all terms by 49 to eliminate denominators.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute:\n\nLet me compute all terms over 49:\n\nTerm1 + 49b - 224 = 0\n\nWait, maybe better to multiply the entire equation by 49 to eliminate denominators.\n\nStarting from:\n\n76*(76 -21b)/49 + 49b = 224\n\nMultiply both sides by 49:\n\n76*(76 -21b) + 49*49b = 224*49\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 76*(76 -21b) = 76^2 - 76*21b\n\nSecond term: 49^2 b\n\nRight-hand side: 224*49\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\n76^2: 76*76. Let's see, 70^2 = 4900, 6^2=36, and cross terms 2*70*6=840, so (70+6)^2 = 4900 + 840 + 36 = 5776. So first part is 5776.\n\n76*21b: 76*21 = let's compute 70*21 + 6*21 = 1470 + 126 = 1596. So that term is 1596b.\n\nSecond term: 49^2 b = 2401b\n\nRight-hand side: 224*49. Let me compute 200*49 = 9800, and 24*49 = 1176, so total is 9800 + 1176 = 10976.\n\nPutting all together:\n\n5776 -1596b + 2401b = 10976\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-1596b +2401b) = 805b\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n5776 + 805b = 10976\n\nSubtract 5776 from both sides:\n\n805b = 10976 - 5776\n\nCompute 10976 -5776:\n\n10976 - 5000 = 5976, then subtract 776 more: 5976 - 776 = 5200. Wait, but that might not be right. Wait 10976 -5776.\n\nWait, 10976 minus 5000 is 5976, then subtract 776 more (since 5776 is 5000+776). So 5976 -776 = 5200. Wait, but let me check:\n\n5776 + 5200 = 10976? Let's see:\n\n5776 + 5000 = 10776, plus 200 more is 10976. Yes, correct.\n\nSo 805b = 5200\n\nTherefore, b = 5200 /805\n\nHmm, let me simplify this fraction. Let's see if both numbers can be divided by 5 first.\n\n5200 \u00f75 = 1040\n\n805 \u00f75= 161\n\nSo now, b = 1040 /161\n\nHmm, 161 divides into 1040 how many times?\n\n161*6 = 966, 1040 -966=74. So 6 with remainder 74. So it's not an integer. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so b would be a fraction? But the question asked if there are integer a and b. Since b here is a fraction, that suggests that there are no integer solutions? Hmm, that might be the case.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a calculation error. Let me double-check my steps.\n\nStarting again:\n\nFrom substitution:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b=224\n\nSolving Equation1 for a:\n\n49a =76 -21b \u2192 a=(76 -21b)/49\n\nSubstituting into Equation2:\n\n76*( (76 -21b)/49 ) +49b =224\n\nMultiply through by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49*49b =224*49\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n76*76 = 5776 (correct)\n\n76*(-21b) = -1596b (correct)\n\n49*49b = 2401b (correct)\n\n224*49: 224*50 =11200, minus 224 gives 11200 -224 = 10976 (correct)\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b =10976\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2401 -1596)=805, so 805b +5776 =10976\n\n805b = 10976 -5776\n\n10976 minus 5776: Let's do 10976 -5000=5976; 5976 -776=5200 (since 5776=5000+776). So 805b=5200\n\nSo b=5200/805. Let me see if 5200 and 805 have a common factor.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 5200/5=1040, 805/5=161. So 1040/161.\n\n161 factors into 7*23. Let me see if 161 divides into 1040.\n\n161*6=966, 1040-966=74. So no, remainder. So 1040 divided by 161 is not an integer. Therefore, b is not an integer. So that suggests there are no integer solutions for a and b here?\n\nWait, but the question is asking if there's a recurrence relation with integer a and b? So that would mean it's not possible? Hmm. But maybe I made a mistake here. Let me try another approach, maybe elimination instead of substitution.\n\nLet me try to set up the equations again:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b=224\n\nLet me try to eliminate one variable. Let's try to eliminate 'a'.\n\nMultiply Equation1 by 76 and Equation2 by 49 so that the coefficients of 'a' will be 49*76 and 76*49, which are the same, then subtract.\n\nWait, so:\n\nMultiply Equation1 by76:\n\n49*76 a +21*76 b =76*76\n\nMultiply Equation2 by49:\n\n76*49 a +49*49 b =224*49\n\nNow subtract the first new equation from the second new equation:\n\n(76*49a -49*76a) + (49^2 b -21*76 b) =224*49 -76^2\n\nWait, but 76*49a -49*76a is zero. So the terms with a cancel out.\n\nSo we get:\n\n[49^2 b -21*76 b] =224*49 -76^2\n\nFactor b:\n\nb*(49^2 -21*76) =224*49 -76^2\n\nCompute each part:\n\nFirst, compute 49^2 -21*76.\n\n49^2 is 2401.\n\n21*76: 20*76=1520, 1*76=76 \u2192 1520+76=1596\n\nSo 2401 -1596= 805\n\nSo left side: 805b\n\nRight side: 224*49 -76^2\n\nCompute 224*49:\n\n224*50=11200, subtract 224 gives 11200-224=10976\n\n76^2 is 5776\n\nSo 10976 -5776 =5200\n\nTherefore, 805b=5200, which is the same as before. So b=5200/805=1040/161 \u22486.46. Not integer. \n\nHmm, so same result. So no integer solution for b here. So that would mean that there are no integer a and b that satisfy both equations? \n\nWait, but maybe the question allows a and b to be fractions? The user just said \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So probably looking for integers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misapplied the recurrence? Let me check if the problem was stated correctly. The user mentions \"For k7=76\" and \"k8=224\", so assuming that the previous terms are known? Wait, but in the equations given:\n\nFor k7 =76, they have 76 =a\u00d7k6 +b\u00d7k5? Wait, actually, hold on a second. Wait the user's setup is perhaps incorrect?\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I need to check the setup again. The user says:\n\n\"For k7 = 76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n\nFor k8 = 224: 224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\"\n\nWait, but if the recurrence is k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}, then to get k7, you need k6 and k5. So k7 = a*k6 + b*k5\n\nSimilarly, k8 =a*k7 + b*k6\n\nWait, but in the equations given, they have k7 =a*49 +b*21. So is 49 the value of k6 and 21 the value of k5?\n\nSo perhaps the prior terms are k5=21 and k6=49. Then k7=76, and k8=224.\n\nWait, so the user is assuming that k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224?\n\nIf that's the case, then the recurrence would need to hold for all those terms. Wait, but the problem is to check if such a recurrence exists with constants a and b, such that starting from some initial terms, the sequence follows k_n =a*k_{n-1} +b*k_{n-2}. The user has given the equations for k7 and k8 in terms of the previous two terms. But perhaps the problem is whether such a recurrence holds for all terms, but here they are only given those two equations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is assuming that the recurrence is supposed to produce k7 and k8 from the prior terms, but if we can find a and b that satisfy both equations, then it works. Since we can't find integer a and b, then it doesn't follow that recurrence? Or maybe non-integer a and b?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in forming the equations. Let me verify the setup again.\n\nSuppose the recurrence is k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2}\n\nThen, for k7 = a k6 + b k5\n\nSimilarly, k8 =a k7 + b k6\n\nAssuming that the prior terms are known. The user has written the equations as:\n\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721 --> which would imply that k6=49 and k5=21.\n\nSimilarly, 224 =a\u00d776 +b\u00d749 --> k7=76 and k6=49.\n\nTherefore, the prior terms k5=21 and k6=49. \n\nTherefore, the equations are set up correctly. But solving for a and b gives fractional values. Therefore, there are no integer solutions for a and b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows a and b to be real numbers? If so, then yes, they can be found, but the problem specifies \"integer a, b\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the equations? Let me check the arithmetic again.\n\nFirst equation: 49a +21b =76\n\nSecond equation:76a +49b=224\n\nLet me try to solve for a and b using fractions.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\nLet me write equations again:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76 --> Let's divide both sides by 7 to simplify.\n\n49/7 =7, 21/7=3, 76/7 \u224810.857...\n\nSo:\n\n7a +3b =76/7 \u224810.857...\n\nHmm, that might not help much. Alternatively, perhaps using linear algebra.\n\nThe system is:\n\n49a +21b =76\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nWe can write this as a matrix equation:\n\n[49 21][a]   = [76]\n\n[76 49][b]     [224]\n\nThe determinant of the coefficient matrix is (49)(49) - (21)(76) = 49\u00b2 -21*76.\n\nCompute determinant D= 2401 -1596=805, as before.\n\nThen, using Cramer's rule:\n\na = ( |76  21| ) / D\n\n        |224 49|\n\nWhich is (76*49 -21*224)/805\n\nCompute numerator:76*49 = 3724; 21*224=4704; so 3724-4704= -980\n\nThus, a= -980 /805 = -196/161 \u2248-1.217\n\nSimilarly, b= ( |49 76| ) / D\n\n             |76 224|\n\nDeterminant:49*224 -76*76\n\nCompute 49*224: 49*200=9800, 49*24=1176, total 9800+1176=10976\n\n76*76=5776\n\nThus numerator is 10976 -5776=5200, so b=5200/805= same as before, 1040/161\u22486.46\n\nTherefore, a\u2248-1.217 and b\u22486.46. Not integers.\n\nTherefore, there is no integer solution for a and b. Therefore, such a linear recurrence with integer coefficients does not exist for these terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo in the numbers? Let me check, but assuming the numbers given are correct, then the answer is no, there are no integer a and b. \n\nAlternatively, if non-integer coefficients are allowed, then yes, but the question specifies integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to consider a different recurrence? Like of higher order, or with a constant term? But the user specified \"a\" and \"b\", so probably a second order linear recurrence with no constant term. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended different prior terms? But based on the equations given, the setup seems as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider that the recurrence could be with different previous terms? But according to the standard linear recurrence, each term depends on the two prior terms, so the equations are set correctly.\n\nTherefore, conclusion: There are no integer values of a and b that satisfy both equations. Hence, such a recurrence does not exist with integer coefficients.\n\nWait, but maybe the question allows a and b to be fractions? The user says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So the answer would be no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where you need to consider that the recurrence might have different coefficients for different terms? But no, a linear recurrence relation has fixed coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in base 10? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made an error in the prior terms. For example, perhaps k6 is 49 and k7 is 76, then if we want k8=224, but the recurrence would need to be a*(76) + b*(49)=224. But solving with the previous equation gives fractional a and b. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting a different approach? Let me see if there is another way. Suppose we think of the recurrence relation, then the characteristic equation would be r^2 -a r -b=0. The roots would determine the behavior. But since we have two terms after k5 and k6, perhaps we can compute the ratio between terms?\n\nAlternatively, compute the ratio between terms:\n\nFrom k5=21 to k6=49: ratio is 49/21\u22482.333\n\nk6 to k7:76/49\u22481.551\n\nk7 to k8:224/76\u22482.947\n\nThese ratios are not consistent with a linear recurrence with constant coefficients, since in such a case, the ratios would approach the dominant root. The varying ratios suggest that it's not a linear recurrence with constant coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different kind of recurrence? Like multiplicative or something else, but the question specifies a and b, so linear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the user to find real numbers a and b, so present those fractions? But the question specifically asks for integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem's numbers. For instance, if k8 was 196 instead of 224, then 76a +49b=196. Let's see:\n\nWith equations 49a +21b=76 and 76a +49b=196.\n\nThen determinant still 805.\n\nCompute a= (76*49 -21*196)/805\n\n76*49=3724; 21*196=4116; 3724-4116= -392\n\na= -392/805= -56/115\u2248-0.487\n\nb=(49*196 -76*76)/805\n\n49*196=9604; 76*76=5776; 9604-5776=3828\n\nb=3828/805\u22484.755. Still not integers.\n\nAlternatively, if k8 was 196, but still no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k5 is different? For instance, if k5 was 14 instead of 21, then equations would be 49a +14b=76 and 76a +49b=224. Let's see:\n\nEquation1:49a +14b=76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b=224\n\nMultiply equation1 by 7: 343a +98b=532\n\nMultiply equation2 by 2:152a +98b=448\n\nSubtract: (343a -152a) +0=532-448 \u2192191a=84 \u2192a=84/191\u22480.44, not integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe different prior terms. But given the problem as stated, the equations lead to non-integer a and b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows a and b to be fractions, so answer a= -196/161 and b=1040/161? But that's probably not what's expected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a miscalculation in forming the equations? Let me check again:\n\nIf k7 = a*k6 +b*k5,\n\nGiven k7=76, k6=49, k5=21,\n\nSo equation is 76 =49 a +21 b,\n\nSimilarly, k8= a*k7 + b*k6,\n\nSo 224=76a +49b,\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is to see if it's possible with real numbers? But the question says integer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where the answer is no, such integers don't exist. So the answer would be no, there are no integers a and b that satisfy the equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects modulo arithmetic? Like mod something? But not indicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants the closest integers? But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in another context where a and b can be real numbers, but the problem says integer.\n\nGiven the problem as stated, I think the answer is that there are no integer solutions for a and b. Therefore, such a recurrence with integer coefficients does not exist for the given terms.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if maybe a and b can be fractions that simplify? For instance, a= -196/161 and b=1040/161. Let me see if those fractions can be simplified:\n\nFor a= -196/161: 196 and 161 share a common factor? 161 is 7\u00d723, 196 is 49\u00d74=7\u00d728. So 7 is a common factor. 196/7=28, 161/7=23. So simplified: -28/23.\n\nSimilarly, 1040/161: 1040 divided by 7 is 148.57, so no. 1040 and 161: 161 is 7\u00d723, 1040 divided by 7 is 148.57, not integer. So 1040/161 cannot be reduced further. So, the fractions are -28/23 and 1040/161. Not integers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows a and b to be any real numbers? Then the answer is yes, with those fractions. But since the question specifies integers, the answer is no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem's numbers. For example, if k8 was 196 instead of 224, but even then, as I saw earlier, the a and b are still non-integers. Alternatively, if the numbers were different, like k5= 14, k6=28, k7=56, k8=112, then it would be a simple doubling each time, so a=0, b=2. But with the current numbers, it's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects matrix methods or something else? Let me try solving the equations again:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me write them as:\n\n49a +21b =76 --> multiply both sides by 76: 49*76 a +21*76 b =76*76\n\n76a +49b =224 --> multiply both sides by 49: 76*49 a +49*49 b =224*49\n\nNow subtract the first multiplied equation from the second:\n\n(76*49 a -49*76 a) + (49*49 b -21*76 b) =224*49 -76*76\n\nThe first term cancels (76*49a -49*76a=0)\n\nSecond term: b*(49\u00b2 -21*76)\n\nCompute 49\u00b2=2401, 21*76=1596, so 2401-1596=805\n\nThus, 805b =224*49 -76\u00b2\n\nCompute 224*49: 224*50=11200 minus 224=10976\n\n76\u00b2=5776\n\nThus, 10976 -5776=5200\n\nThus 805b=5200 --> b=5200/805=1040/161 same as before.\n\nTherefore, same result. So no integer solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that no such integers a and b exist.\n\nBut the problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". It might expect the values of a and b as fractions, but since the question specifies integers, maybe the answer is \"No solution\", but in the format required, perhaps boxed as \\boxed{\\text{No solution}} but usually in math problems like this, if it's a competition, maybe they expect to write the fractional form but since question says integer, maybe the problem is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the numbers? Let me check again:\n\n\"F: Given the numbers k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, find a and b such that k8=224 is generated by the recurrence k_{n}=a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2}.\"\n\nWait, the user hasn't actually provided the problem statement in full. The initial problem might have different numbers. Wait, in the original problem stated by the user, it's just:\n\n\"F: Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nF: Given the numbers k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, find a and b such that k8=224 is generated by the recurrence k_{n}=a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2}.\"\n\nWait, that's the problem? The user's first message is this? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user's message is:\n\n\"F: Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nF: Given the numbers k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, find a and b such that k8=224 is generated by the recurrence k_{n}=a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2}.\"\n\nWait, so that is the problem. So the question is to find integers a and b such that with the given terms, k8=224 is generated by that recurrence. But as we saw, there are no integer solutions. So the answer is that there is no solution. But maybe the problem expects real numbers?\n\nWait, the problem says \"find a and b\", without specifying they need to be integers. Maybe I assumed that because the user mentioned \"integer\" in their thinking, but the original problem didn't specify. Wait let me recheck:\n\nThe user's problem says: \"find a and b such that k8=224 is generated by the recurrence k_{n}=a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2}.\"\n\nThere is no mention of a and b needing to be integers. So perhaps the problem just wants the real numbers a and b. In that case, the solution is a= -196/161\u2248-1.217 and b=1040/161\u22486.46. But to present them as fractions:\n\nFrom above:\n\nFrom the equations:\n\n49a + 21b =76 --> equation1\n\n76a +49b =224 --> equation2\n\nLet me solve for a and b.\n\nMultiply equation1 by 49: 49*49 a +21*49 b =76*49\n\nMultiply equation2 by21: 76*21 a +49*21 b =224*21\n\nSubtract equation1*49 - equation2*21:\n\n(49\u00b2 -76*21)a + (21*49 -49*21)b =76*49 -224*21\n\nWait, the b terms cancel. Wait:\n\nWait let me do it step by step.\n\nEquation1 multiplied by 49:\n\n49*(49a +21b)=49*76 \u2192 49\u00b2 a + 21*49 b =76*49\n\nEquation2 multiplied by21:\n\n21*(76a +49b)=21*224 \u219276*21 a +49*21 b =224*21\n\nNow subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n[49\u00b2 a -76*21 a] + [21*49 b -49*21 b] =76*49 -224*21\n\nThe b terms cancel (21*49 -49*21=0)\n\nThus:\n\na*(49\u00b2 -76*21)=76*49 -224*21\n\nCompute 49\u00b2=2401; 76*21=1596. So 2401-1596=805\n\nThus, a= (76*49 -224*21)/805\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n76*49 =3724\n\n224*21=4704\n\nThus, 3724-4704= -980\n\nThus a= -980/805= simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 35: -28/23\n\nSimilarly for b, using equation1:\n\n49a +21b=76\n\nPlug a= -28/23:\n\n49*(-28/23) +21b =76\n\nCompute 49*(-28)= -1372; divided by23: -1372/23\n\nThus,\n\n21b =76 +1372/23\n\nConvert 76 to over23: 76=76*23/23=1748/23\n\nThus,\n\n21b=(1748 +1372)/23 =3120/23\n\nHence, b= (3120/23)/21= 3120/(23*21)= 3120/483 simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n3120 \u00f73=1040; 483 \u00f73=161\n\nThus b=1040/161\n\nSo the solution is a= -28/23 and b=1040/161.\n\nSimplify further:\n\n-28/23 is already reduced. 1040/161: 161 divides into 1040 how? 161*6=966, 1040-966=74, so no, cannot reduce.\n\nThus, the exact values are a= -28/23 and b=1040/161.\n\nBut the problem says to put the final answer in a box. Since they might want fractions, boxed as:\n\na = \\boxed{-\\dfrac{28}{23}}, b = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1040}{161}}\n\nBut since the problem says \"find a and b\", maybe present both in one box? The user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". Maybe as a pair:\n\n\\boxed{a = -\\dfrac{28}{23}, b = \\dfrac{1040}{161}}\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want decimals? But fractions are exact.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation? Let me check the equations again with these fractions.\n\nCheck equation1: 49a +21b =76\n\nPlug a= -28/23, b=1040/161:\n\n49*(-28/23) +21*(1040/161)\n\nFirst term:49*(-28)/23 = (-1372)/23\n\nSecond term:21*(1040)/161 =21*1040/(23*7) since 161=23*7\n\nWait 21 and 161: 161 is 23*7, so 21 and 161 have a common factor of 7:\n\n21=7*3, 161=23*7, so:\n\n21/161=3/(23)\n\nThus, 21*(1040)/161= (3/23)*1040 =3120/23\n\nThus, total equation1:\n\n-1372/23 +3120/23= (3120-1372)/23=1748/23=76, which matches.\n\nEquation2:76a +49b=224\n\n76*(-28/23) +49*(1040/161)\n\nFirst term:76*(-28)/23= (76/23)*(-28)= (76 divided by23 is 3.304..., but exact fraction: 76=23*3 +7, so 76/23=3 +7/23. But better:\n\n76*(-28)/23 = (76/23)*(-28)= (76 divided by23 is 3 and 7/23, but better to keep as fraction:\n\n76*(-28)/23 = (-76*28)/23\n\nSecond term:49*(1040)/161 =49*(1040)/(23*7)= (49/7)*1040/23=7*1040/23=7280/23\n\nThus total equation2:\n\n(-76*28)/23 +7280/23 = [ -2128 +7280 ] /23 = (5152)/23\n\nCompute 5152 \u00f723: 23*224=5152 (23*200=4600, 23*24=552; total 4600+552=5152). Thus 5152/23=224, which matches.\n\nThus the fractions are correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is a=-28/23 and b=1040/161.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify integers, these are the correct real numbers.\n\nBut the user initially thought it might need integers, but since the problem didn't say, the answer is the fractions.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are \\boxed{a = -\\dfrac{28}{23}} and \\boxed{b = \\dfrac{1040}{161}}.\n",
