I'm trying to parse the given info. Actually, let me read exactly:\n\n```\nINDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n```\n\nSo what is \"key\" notation? Possibly keys are defined as numbers: k2, k3, etc. We have some product pattern where maybe the key number for index n can be represented in form: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) or something like that.\n\nWe see examples:\n- For k8: It is said \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713\". So apparently if we assume a formula of the type: k8 = f(8)*8 + some constant? But they show that k8 divided by 8 equals 28. That suggests that f(8) = 28, and maybe g(8)=0?\n\n- For k11: They say \"k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\". So presumably f(11)=105? Wait check: It might be that if we have k11 = 11 * 105 then that gives 1155 exactly. Yes, indeed 11 * 105 = 1155.\n\n- For k12, they say \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". So apparently if we plug in the formula: maybe f(12)=? Let's see: They mention that k8 is equal to 28, so then maybe f(12) = (k8*12 - 5)/12 = (28*12 - 5)/12. 28*12=336; 336-5=331, divided by 12 gives 27.5833 not integer? Wait, they said \"2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". So what's that exactly? Let me check: maybe f(12) is computed as (k8 \u00d7 12 - 5)/12? That equals (28*12 - 5)/12 = (336 -5)/12 = 331/12 = 27.5833, which does not look like integer.\n\nWait, let's re-read the text carefully: \nIt says:\n\"OBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\"\n\nSo for index 12, the pattern is that k12 equals \"k8 * 12 - 5\". And then later they check: \"CHECK:\n...\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\n\nSo what do these \"CHECK\" items mean? They are trying to see if a formula of the form: k_n = f(n) * n + g(n) holds, maybe with integer coefficient when divided by n. For example, for index 7 they get 76/7 = 10.86, not an integer; for index 8, 224/8=28, which is integer; for index 9, 467/9=51.89 not integer; for index 11, 1155/11=105 integer; for index 12, if you try that formula it doesn't give an integer coefficient, but then they note that \"k8\u00d712-5=2683\", which is equal to k12.\n\nSo likely the pattern: For some keys, f(n) = (k_n)/n maybe? And for others, a formula involving previous keys might be used. But question says \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nMaybe we need to derive function f(n) from given products and sums formulas that match the observed keys. Possibly the pattern is: k_n = n * something - some constant, where sometimes the index appears.\n\nLet's denote: For a certain n, it might be expressed as: \nk_n = f(n)*n + g(n), with unknown function f(n) and maybe constant offset.\n\nWe have examples:\nFor k8, they claim 224/8=28. So that means f(8)=28 and presumably g(8)=0 if the division is exact.\nFor k11: 1155/11 = 105 exactly, so f(11)=105 and again g(11)=0.\nFor k12: They mention \"k8\u00d712-5\" equals 2683. But then if we try to write it as ? \u00d7 12 + ?, maybe that would be (28\u00d712 - 5)/? Let's see: If f(12) was computed as (k8\u00d712-5)/12, that is (28*12 -5)/12 = (336 -5)/12 = 331/12 which isn't integer. But they already observed that k12 doesn't yield an integer when divided by 12 if we try the pattern f(n)*n + g(n) with constant offset? \nWait, but then \"k8\u00d712-5\" suggests a different form: for index 12 it's expressed as k8 multiplied by 12 and then subtracting 5. For index 11, they have a pattern that is \"1155/11=105\", i.e., k11 = 105 \u00d7 11. For index 7, they get k7 = something*7 + something? Not clear.\n\nMaybe the question: \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" means derive an explicit function f such that k_n = n * f(n) for those indices where it holds (or nearly). The text says: \"So k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711.\" Then they note, \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So maybe we have a sequence of keys with indexes 2,3,... etc. We are given: \n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (observed)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\nand then check:\n- k7 gives something not integer factorization.\n- k9 gives non integer factorization.\n\nSo maybe the answer is: f(2)=? f(3)=? But we haven't been given explicit values for k2, k3. Wait, \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" means that key 5 equals product of keys 2 and 3. So if we assume each key can be represented as n * f(n) + constant maybe, then perhaps there is a pattern.\n\nMaybe the intended sequence is something like: \nk2 = ?,\nk3 = ?,\nk4 = ?\nk5 = k2*k3\nk7 = ? etc.\n\nWe have computed for some keys:\nk8 = 224? Wait, check \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8=28\", that means k8 = 28\u00d78 = 224.\nk11 = 1155 so f(11)=105\nk12 = 2683 (from the equation: k8\u00d712-5)\n\nBut then what are others? We have:\nk7, k9, etc.\n\nGiven the text \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" might be interpreted as: Given that sometimes k_n is of the form n * f(n) + constant (maybe 0) and sometimes not. For indices where it fits, we can compute f(n)=k_n / n. So:\nFor n=8, f(8) = 224/8 = 28.\nFor n=11, f(11)=1155/11 = 105.\n\nMaybe also for k12 using the pattern \"k12 = k8\u00d712-5\", but that doesn't have the form: It would be (k8*12 - 5)/12 if we try to find a factor. That equals (224*12 -5)/12? But wait, they already computed: k12=2683 so f(12)=? Let's compute: 2683/12 = 223.58333... which is not integer.\n\nMaybe then for keys that have the \"n * f(n)\" pattern, we can list them:\nFor key n where such formula holds exactly with an integer factor, f(n) equals k_n / n.\nWe know: \nk2? What is k2?\nObserving pattern: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\". If k2 and k3 are known then maybe we assume k2 = 1 or something? Not sure.\n\nWait, the text: \"OBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\". That line is confusing: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" then in parentheses it says \"(indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\" Possibly meaning that if we multiply the indices 2 and 3, we get 6, but key number 5 might be something else.\n\nMaybe I should re-read the text as written:\n\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\nMaybe the idea is: \"For keys where we can express them as n*f(n) exactly, compute f(n).\" The question then \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" might be interpreted as: For key 2, what's f(2)? For key 3, etc. But they only provided data for keys 7,8,9,11,12.\n\nMaybe we assume that when the formula \"k_n = ? \u00d7 n + ?\" holds with integer coefficient (i.e., k_n is divisible by n), then f(n) equals k_n / n. And they computed:\nFor key 8: f(8)=224/8=28.\nFor key 11: f(11)=1155/11=105.\n\nFor keys that do not yield an integer quotient, maybe the pattern doesn't hold (like k7 and k9).\n\nThen what about k12? They note that if you try to force formula k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), it doesn't work because 2683/12 is not an integer. But they also observed a relationship: k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5. And since k8 is known (28*8=224) then k12 becomes 28*12-5 =336-5=331? Wait check: 28\u00d712=336, minus 5 equals 331, but they said k12=2683. There's an inconsistency.\n\nLet me re-read that line carefully: \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". So it seems that the expression \"k8\u00d712 - 5\" equals 2683, not 28*12-5, which would be 336-5=331. Perhaps I'm misinterpreting: maybe k8 is not 28? Let's re-read line 2: \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\". That means k8 equals something times 8 plus something, and they computed that division gives 28. So maybe it implies that the coefficient in front of n for key8 is 28, i.e., f(8)=? Actually, if you have a formula: k_n = a*n + b, then dividing by n yields a + (b/n). For n=8, we got an integer quotient which suggests b might be 0. So indeed k8 = 28\u00d78.\n\nNow for key12, they try to express it as ? \u00d7 12 + ?. That would normally be of the form k12 = f(12)*12 + g(12). They computed 2683/12 \u2248 223.58, not an integer, so if we assume b=0 then that wouldn't hold. But then they note \"but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". Wait, check: k8 is known to be 28*8 =224? Then k8\u00d712-5 equals 224*12 -5 = 2688-5=2683. So indeed k12 = 2683 can also be expressed as (k8)*12 - 5. So for key12, the pattern is different: instead of being a simple multiple of 12, it's k8 multiplied by 12 minus 5.\n\nMaybe then \"f(n)\" should be computed as follows:\nFor keys that factor nicely with n (i.e., when k_n/n is an integer), f(n) = k_n / n.\nSo from the data: \n- For key7: k7=76? Because they mention \"k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86\". So maybe k7 = 76 (maybe not, because 76/7 is 10.857...). But then f(7) would be non-integer.\n- For key8: k8=224, so f(8)=28.\n- For key9: k9=467? Because \"467/9\" equals approximately 51.89, not integer, so f(9) is not integer.\n- For key11: k11 = 1155, so f(11)=105.\n- For key12: if we try to express it as a multiple of 12, we get noninteger coefficient (2683/12). But also note that k12 equals \"k8\u00d712 - 5\", and k8=224. So maybe in that case, f(12) is defined via the formula using k8: i.e., f(12)=? It's not simply k12 /12 because that doesn't yield an integer.\n\nMaybe the answer expected is something like:\nFor key n, if there exists a representation of k_n as (f(n))*n + g(n), then for those keys where this factorization holds with no remainder (like k8 and k11), f(2)=? I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects: \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" meaning: Given that sometimes we have a term like f(n)*n, sometimes it's given by an expression involving previous keys. In particular, for n=12, f(12) would be (k8*12 -5)/12 = k8 - 5/12, but that doesn't simplify nicely.\n\nMaybe the question is incomplete?\n\nLet me re-read: \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\" Possibly from some puzzle where each key's value can be expressed as a product or sum of previous keys. The observed pattern:\n- For key5: k5 = k2 * k3.\n- For key12: k12 = (k8 * 12) - 5.\n\nThen the hypothesis: \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\" And then they check for other indices:\n1. Key7: does it follow a pattern of form ? \u00d7 7 + ?; if we try to divide by 7, we get 76/7 which is not an integer.\n2. Key8: works perfectly as 28*8.\n3. Key9: gives non-integer quotient.\n4. Key11: gives integer quotient 105.\n5. Key12: doesn't yield a neat multiple of 12 unless you use the special formula k8\u00d712 - 5.\n\nSo maybe we list:\nFor key7, f(7) would be something like floor(76/7)? But that's not clear.\n\nMaybe the answer is: f(n)=k_n/n if k_n mod n =0, otherwise it does not have a \"nice\" factorization. So from the checks: \n- For n=2,3, ? we don't have data.\n- For n=5, the pattern is product of previous keys (not linear).\n- For n=7 and 9, the quotient k_n/n is non-integer.\n- For n=8, f(8)=28.\n- For n=11, f(11)=105.\n- For n=12, if we try a linear form, it doesn't work out cleanly.\n\nMaybe they want: f(2) = 2? f(3)=3? Because then k5 would be 2*3=6? But then later keys don't match. Alternatively, maybe there is an underlying sequence where the product of indices sometimes gives the key value (like factorial-like structure). But no.\n\nPerhaps we can try to derive from k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5 and known k8=224: That gives 2683 for k12.\nMaybe then k11 was given as 1155, and if we assume a similar pattern for keys that are not multiples of their index, maybe f(n) is computed as floor(k_n/n) or something.\n\nGiven the check \"k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86\" suggests that k7 might be 76? And then if we compute 76/7 it's not an integer.\nSimilarly, k9 = 467, and 467/9 \u2248 51.89.\n\nMaybe the answer: f(2) = ?, f(3)=?, etc., but we don't have enough info.\n\nPerhaps I'll assume that keys which can be represented as a multiple of their index are those where there is no additional constant term in the formula, and then f(n)=k_n/n. So from the provided data:\n- For key8: f(8) = 224/8 = 28.\n- For key11: f(11) = 1155/11 = 105.\n\nFor keys where it doesn't work, maybe there is no simple f(n). The question \"Calculate f(n)\" might be interpreted as: \nf(n) = k_n / n if k_n is divisible by n, otherwise f(n) does not exist in that form.\nThen the answer would be:\nKey2: (unknown),\nKey3: (unknown),\nKey4: (not provided),\nKey5: k5 = k2 * k3,\nKey7: 76/7 \u2248 10.86, so no neat integer f(7),\nKey8: 224/8 = 28,\nKey9: 467/9 \u2248 51.89, not an integer,\nKey11: 1155/11 = 105,\nKey12: if expressed as a linear function of index, it doesn't yield an integer coefficient.\n\nMaybe they want: f(n) = (k_n)/n for those n where the pattern holds; thus:\nFor key7, f(7)=76/7 \u2248 10.857;\nfor key8, f(8)=28;\nfor key9, f(9)=467/9 \u2248 51.889;\nfor key11, f(11)=105.\n\nBut then \"Calculate f(n)\" seems trivial: just divide k_n by n.\n\nUnless the intended answer is to express each key in terms of its index and previous keys. Perhaps the answer: \nk2 = ?\nk3 = ?\nk4 = k2 + 1 maybe? There might be a known sequence like the \"index product pattern\" from some puzzle website.\n\nMaybe I can assume that the keys are defined recursively, e.g., k_n = n * f(n) with f(n) given by: \nf(2)=?, f(3)=?, then k5 = k2 * k3 implies f(5)=? But no clear pattern emerges.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is simply a list of computed values:\nFor key7: 76/7 \u2248 10.857,\nfor key8: 224/8 = 28,\nfor key9: 467/9 \u2248 51.889,\nfor key11: 1155/11 = 105.\n\nBut then what is k12? That doesn't fit the pattern unless we use k8, so perhaps f(12) would be (k8\u00d712-5)/12 = k8 - 5/12 = 224 - 0.4167 \u2248 223.5833, which is not an integer.\n\nI worry that there is insufficient context to determine a unique answer.\n\nMaybe I'll provide the following answer:\nThe keys appear to sometimes factor as n * f(n) exactly and other times they do not. For those indices where k_n is divisible by n, we can compute f(n)=k_n/n.\nFrom our calculations:\n- Key7: 76/7 \u2248 10.857 (not an integer), so no simple f(7).\n- Key8: 224/8 = 28, so f(8) = 28.\n- Key9: 467/9 \u2248 51.889 (no neat factorization), so no simple f(9).\n- Key11: 1155/11 = 105, so f(11)=105.\n- Key12: Although k12=2683, it can be written as k8*12 - 5; if we force a form n*f(n) + g(n), then f(12) would be (k12 + something)/12. However, since 2683/12 is not an integer, the pattern does not yield an integer factor for key12.\n\nThus, only keys with indices 8 and 11 have a neat representation of the form n * f(n).\n\nMaybe that's the intended answer: \"Only when the index divides k_n evenly do we obtain a clean result. In our checks, only k8 and k11 are divisible by their respective indexes, yielding f(8)=28 and f(11)=105.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects an answer like:\nf(n) = \n- For n=2,3,4,...: if k_n mod n = 0 then f(n)=k_n/n, otherwise no simple form.\nAnd specifically,\nf(7)=76/7,\nf(8)=28,\nf(9)=467/9,\nf(11)=105,\nand for n=12, the formula given is f(12) = k8 - 5/12.\n\nBut that doesn't feel satisfying.\n\nMaybe I'll answer: \"The key values we have are:\nk2 = ? (unspecified),\nk3 = ? (unspecified),\nk4 = ?,\nk5 = k2 \u00d7 k3,\nk7 = 76,\nk8 = 224, so f(8)=28,\nk9 = 467,\nk11 = 1155, so f(11)=105,\nk12 = 2683, which also equals (k8\u00d712 - 5).\nThus the integer factors (f(n)) for keys 7,8,9,11,12 are:\n- For key7: 76/7 \u2248 10.857 (not an integer),\n- For key8: f(8)=28,\n- For key9: 467/9 \u2248 51.889 (not an integer),\n- For key11: f(11)=105,\nand for key12 the formula k12 = k8\u00d712 -5 does not yield a simple factorization of the form n * f(n) with an integer f(12).\"\n\nMaybe that's it.\n\nI think I'll answer along those lines, clarifying that only keys 8 and 11 have the property that they are exactly multiples of their indices. For key7 and key9, when dividing by 7 and 9 respectively, the quotient is not an integer (approx. 10.857 and 51.889), while for key12, although one might expect a similar form, the observed value k12=2683 cannot be written as 12 times an integer; however it does equal k8\u00d712 -5.\n\nThus, f(7) = 76/7 (noninteger),\nf(8)=28,\nf(9)=467/9 (noninteger),\nf(11)=105,\nand f(12) would be (2683 + ?)/12 if forced into that form, but it's not an integer.\n\nI'll answer: \"The pattern is not consistent across all keys. Only for key 8 and key 11 does k_n divide evenly by n, yielding f(8)=28 and f(11)=105 respectively; while for keys 7, 9, and 12, the quotient isn't an integer (or requires a different formulation), so no simple 'f(n)' exists in those cases.\"\n\nThat seems to be the best answer I can provide given the provided data.\n\nI'll produce my final answer now.</think>Below is one way of \u201creading\u201d the situation. In some puzzles a key\u2019s value k\u2099 is claimed to have an expression of the form\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = n\u00b7f(n) + (possibly an extra constant)\n\nso that when n divides k\u2099 evenly you get a \u201cnice\u2010number\u201d f(n).\n\nFor example, two observed facts were:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2085 is given by the product of earlier keys: k\u2085 = k\u2082 \u00b7 k\u2083.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2081\u2082 is given by a formula that involves its index: \n\u2003\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = (k\u2088\u00b712) \u2013 5.\n\nThen one \u201cchecks\u201d other indices. In our case the numbers we found were:\n\u2003\u2013 For key\u00a07 one has k\u2087 = 76 so that\n\u2003\u2003\u2003f(7) = 76\u20447 \u2248 10.857 (not an integer).\n\u2003\u2013 For key\u00a08 one finds k\u2088 = 224 and indeed\n\u2003\u2003\u2003f(8) = 224\u20448 = 28.\n\u2003\u2013 For key\u00a09 one has k\u2089 = 467 so that\n\u2003\u2003\u2003f(9) = 467\u20449 \u2248 51.889 (again not an integer).\n\u2003\u2013 For key\u00a011 one finds k\u2081\u2081 = 1155 and\n\u2003\u2003\u2003f(11) = 1155\u204411 = 105.\n\u2003\u2013 Finally, although one might \u201cexpect\u201d a similar form for key\u00a012,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 was observed to be 2683 (and in fact k\u2081\u2082 = (224\u00d712) \u2013 5),\nso that 2683 divided by 12 is not an integer.\n\nThus the pattern is only \u201cnice\u201d when the quotient f(n)=k\u2099\u2044n comes out as an integer. In our check the only cases with a nice answer are:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003f(8) = 28 \n\u2003\u2022\u2003f(11) = 105\n\nIn other words, while one can always \u201cformally\u201d write f(n)=k\u2099\u2044n, only for n = 8 and 11 does that give a clean integer. (The key k\u2081\u2082 is given by a different formula\u2014namely, k\u2081\u2082 = k\u2088\u00d712 \u20135\u2014and neither 76 nor 467 divides evenly by their respective indices.)\n\nSo one acceptable answer is to say:\n\n\u2003\u2013 For keys where the index divides the value evenly we have\n\u2003\u2003f(8)=224\u20448=28\u2003and\u2003f(11)=1155\u204411=105;\n\u2003\u2013 for key\u00a07, f(7)\u224810.857 and for key\u00a09, f(9)\u224851.889;\n\u2003\u2013 and while k\u2081\u2082 is given by 2683 = (224\u00d712) \u20135 the quotient 2683\u204412 is not an integer.\n\nAny answer that explains that only keys 8 and 11 \u201cwork nicely\u201d in the sense of giving an integer factor f(n)=k\u2099\u2044n is correct.",
