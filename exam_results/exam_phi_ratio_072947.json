  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if there's a Fibonacci or golden ratio connection in these numbers given here. The user provided some ratios between the terms k8/k7, k7/k6, etc., and noticed that some are close to the golden ratio \u03c6 (1.618) and its square \u03c6\u00b2 (2.618). They also mentioned checking higher terms like k14/k13, etc. Let me start by recalling what the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio are about.\n\nFirst, the Fibonacci sequence is defined as F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with starting values F(1)=1, F(2)=1. The golden ratio \u03c6 is the limit of the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers as n approaches infinity, so indeed \u03c6 \u2248 1.618, and \u03c6\u00b2 = \u03c6 + 1 \u2248 2.618. So if a sequence has ratios approaching \u03c6 or \u03c6\u00b2, that might indicate a Fibonacci-like connection.\n\nLooking at the given ratios:\n\n- k8/k7 = 224/76 \u2248 2.947. Hmm, that's higher than \u03c6\u00b2 (which is 2.618). Not close.\n- k7/k6 = 76/49 \u2248 1.551. The user says this is close to \u03c6 (1.618). It's somewhat close but not super close. The difference is about 0.067. Maybe with more terms it gets closer?\n- k6/k5 = 49/21 \u2248 2.333. That's between \u03c6 and \u03c6\u00b2. Not particularly close to either.\n- k5/k4 = 21/8 = 2.625. The user points out this is close to \u03c6\u00b2 (2.618). The difference here is about 0.007, which is really close!\n- k4/k3 = 8/7 \u2248 1.143. Not close to \u03c6.\n- k3/k2 = 7/3 \u2248 2.333. Again, same as k6/k5.\n\nThen for the higher terms:\n\n- k14/k13 \u2248 10544/5765 \u2248 1.829. Hmm, that's between 1 and 2. Not too close to \u03c6 or \u03c6\u00b2.\n- k13/k12 \u2248 5765/2683 \u2248 2.148. Closer to \u03c6\u00b2? \u03c6\u00b2 is 2.618, so 2.148 is still a bit lower.\n- k12/k11 \u2248 2683/1155 \u2248 2.323. Again similar to previous ratios.\n\nSo the closest ones are k7/k6 \u22481.551 (to \u03c6) and k5/k4=2.625 (to \u03c6\u00b2). Maybe the sequence isn't exactly Fibonacci but has some relation?\n\nLet me see if the sequence given follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence. Let's denote the terms as k2 to k8: \n\nAssuming the terms are k2=3, k3=7, k4=8, k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224. Wait, actually, the user didn't list the terms, just the ratios. Wait, actually, the ratios given are between these k terms. Let me make sure I have the terms correctly.\n\nWait, the user says:\n\nCheck ratios:\n\nk8/k7 = 224/76 \u22482.947\n\nSo that implies k8 is 224, k7 is 76, k6 is 49, k5 is 21, k4 is 8, k3 is 7, k2 is 3? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, k3/k2 = 7/3, so k3=7, k2=3.\n\nk4/k3 =8/7, so k4=8, k3=7.\n\nk5/k4 =21/8 \u21d2 k5=21, k4=8.\n\nk6/k5 =49/21 \u21d2 k6=49, k5=21.\n\nk7/k6 =76/49 \u21d2 k7=76, k6=49.\n\nk8/k7 =224/76 \u21d2 k8=224, k7=76.\n\nSo the terms from k2 to k8 are:\n\nk2:3, k3:7, k4:8, k5:21, k6:49, k7:76, k8:224.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me list them out:\n\nk2 = 3\n\nk3 = 7\n\nk4 = 8\n\nk5 = 21\n\nk6 = 49\n\nk7 = 76\n\nk8 = 224\n\nThen for the higher terms, they mention:\n\nk14/k13 \u224810544/5765\n\nk13/k12 \u22485765/2683\n\nk12/k11 \u22482683/1155\n\nSo perhaps the terms up to k14 are known? But the user didn't list them, but gives some higher ratios.\n\nHmm. Let me see if this sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence. Let's check the terms:\n\nStarting from k2=3, k3=7. Let's see if each term is the sum of previous terms or some combination.\n\nCheck k4=8. If it's Fibonacci, k4 would be k3 +k2 =7+3=10, but here it is 8. So not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a different recurrence. Let's see:\n\nLet me compute the differences between terms:\n\nk3 -k2 =7-3=4\n\nk4 -k3=8-7=1\n\nk5 -k4=21-8=13\n\nk6 -k5=49-21=28\n\nk7 -k6=76-49=27\n\nk8 -k7=224-76=148\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, check if each term is a multiple of previous terms. Let's see:\n\nk5 =21. Let's see if it relates to previous terms:\n\n21 = 8 (k4) * 2.625? 8 * 2.625 is 21, yes. So 21 = 8 * (21/8)=2.625. Which is close to \u03c6\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, k6=49. 49/k5=49/21\u22482.333, which is (something else).\n\nk7=76. 76/49\u22481.551, which is near \u03c6.\n\nWait, perhaps the recurrence relation is something like k(n) = a*k(n-1) + b*k(n-2), with some coefficients?\n\nLet me try to find coefficients a and b such that:\n\nFor example, starting from k2 to k8:\n\nAssume that for n >=4, k(n) = a*k(n-1) + b*k(n-2)\n\nLet me try with k4=8. If n=4,\n\nk4 = a*k3 + b*k2 \u21d2 8 = a*7 + b*3\n\nSimilarly for k5=21:\n\n21 = a*8 + b*7\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n7a + 3b = 8\n\n8a +7b =21\n\nLet me solve these equations.\n\nMultiply first equation by 8: 56a +24b =64\n\nMultiply second by7: 56a +49b=147\n\nSubtract first from second: (56a +49b) - (56a +24b)=147 -64 \u21d225b=83 \u21d2b=83/25=3.32\n\nThen substitute back into first equation:\n\n7a +3*(83/25) =8 \u21d27a =8 - (249/25)= (200/25 -249/25)= (-49/25)\n\nThus a= (-49/25)/7= -7/25\u2248-0.28\n\nHmm, so a\u2248-0.28 and b\u22483.32. Not very promising, and with a negative coefficient. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a different recurrence depth? Like k(n)=a*k(n-1)+b*k(n-2)+c*k(n-3). But that might get too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence has a relation to Fibonacci numbers multiplied by some factors?\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\nk2=3, Fibonacci numbers are 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89, etc.\n\nHmm, 3 is F4=3, but k2=3. Not sure.\n\nk3=7. Fibonacci F6=8, close but not exact.\n\nk4=8 is F6=8.\n\nk5=21 is F8=21.\n\nk6=49. Fibonacci F9=34, F10=55. Not close.\n\nHmm, interesting, so k4 is F6, k5 is F8, but then k6 jumps to 49 which isn't a Fibonacci number. Maybe every other Fibonacci number? Let's see:\n\nIf starting from F4=3 (k2=3), F6=8 (k4=8), F8=21 (k5=21), F10=55? But k6 is 49, not 55. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe shifted indices. Let me see:\n\nSuppose k2 corresponds to F(n), then:\n\nk2=3=F4,\n\nk3=7 (Fibonacci 7 is not a standard term, since F7=13),\n\nWait, maybe another sequence? Not Fibonacci.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms k(n) are related to Fibonacci(n)*something?\n\nLooking at k5=21 which is exactly F8=21, k4=8=F6=8, k3=7 is not a Fibonacci number, k2=3=F4.\n\nHmm, so skipping some terms? Maybe k(n) = F(2n)? Let's check:\n\nIf n=2, 2n=4, F4=3, so k2=3.\n\nn=3, 2n=6, F6=8, but k3 is 7. Not quite.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms k(n) follow a Fibonacci-like recurrence but starting with different initial terms?\n\nLet me see:\n\nSuppose we define a sequence with different starting points. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the sequence starts at k1, but the user starts giving terms from k2.\n\nAlternatively, let's see the ratios again:\n\nLooking at k5/k4 =21/8\u22482.625 which is very close to \u03c6\u00b2\u22482.618. The difference is 0.007. That's really close. Similarly, k7/k6\u22481.55 which is somewhat close to \u03c6.\n\nMaybe the terms are following a second-order linear recurrence with coefficients related to \u03c6?\n\nA Fibonacci-like recurrence with coefficients involving \u03c6?\n\nAlternatively, let me see if the terms can be expressed as linear combinations of powers of \u03c6.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the higher terms mentioned:\n\nk14/k13\u224810544/5765\u22481.829,\n\nk13/k12\u22485765/2683\u22482.148,\n\nk12/k11\u22482683/1155\u22482.323.\n\nHmm, 2.148 is still not very close to \u03c6 or \u03c6\u00b2, but 2.323 is close to the earlier ratios like k6/k5\u22482.333.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratios alternate between being near \u03c6 and \u03c6\u00b2? Let me see the pattern:\n\nFrom the lower terms:\n\nk7/k6\u22481.55 (near \u03c6),\n\nk6/k5\u22482.333 (between \u03c6 and \u03c6\u00b2),\n\nk5/k4\u22482.625 (near \u03c6\u00b2),\n\nk4/k3\u22481.143 (way below),\n\nk3/k2\u22482.333,\n\nSo the ratios aren't consistently near \u03c6 or \u03c6\u00b2 except for k5/k4 and k7/k6.\n\nLooking at the higher ratios:\n\nk14/k13\u22481.829,\n\nk13/k12\u22482.148,\n\nk12/k11\u22482.323,\n\nHmm, 1.829 is still below \u03c6 (which is 1.618 wait no, 1.829 is higher than \u03c6. Wait, \u03c6 is 1.618, so 1.829 is higher, but still not as close as 2.625 to \u03c6\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is a Fibonacci-type sequence but with a different starting ratio?\n\nWait, let me try to see if the terms satisfy a recurrence relation related to the golden ratio.\n\nSuppose the recurrence is similar to the Fibonacci recurrence, but with a coefficient involving \u03c6.\n\nSuppose the recurrence is k(n) = \u03c6 * k(n-1) + k(n-2). Let me test this.\n\nWait, if that's the case, let's see:\n\nStarting with k2=3, k3=7.\n\nThen k4 would be \u03c6*k3 +k2 \u22481.618*7 +3\u224811.326+3\u224814.326, but actual k4 is 8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k(n) = k(n-1) + k(n-2), but that would be Fibonacci. But as before, the terms don't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k(n) = k(n-1) + k(n-2) + something?\n\nAlternatively, let me check the terms again:\n\nLooking at the terms up to k8:\n\n3,7,8,21,49,76,224.\n\nWait, let's see the progression:\n\nFrom 3 to7: +4\n\n7 to8: +1\n\n8 to21: +13\n\n21 to49: +28\n\n49 to76: +27\n\n76 to224: +148\n\nHmm, the differences are 4,1,13,28,27,148. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is generated by some other rule, like k(n) = k(n-1)*something + k(n-2)*something else.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if the terms relate to Fibonacci numbers in a different way. For example, every third term?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is the Fibonacci convolution or some other combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms correspond to a Fibonacci-type sequence starting with different seeds.\n\nSuppose we start with k1=1, k2=3 (since the user starts at k2=3), then k3= k2 +k1=4, which is not 7. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, starting with k1=2, k2=3: then k3=5, not 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplication instead of addition? Let's see:\n\nIf k3= k2 * some factor: 7/3\u22482.333, then k4 would need to be 7 * same factor, but 8 vs 7*(2.333)=16.333, nope.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are related to Lucas numbers? Lucas sequence starts with 2,1,3,4,7,11,18,29,47,76, etc.\n\nWait, looking at Lucas numbers:\n\nL1=1, L2=3, L3=4, L4=7, L5=11, L6=18, L7=29, L8=47, L9=76, L10=123, etc.\n\nHmm, comparing to our terms:\n\nk2=3 (matches L2),\n\nk3=7 (L4=7),\n\nk4=8 (not a Lucas number),\n\nk5=21 (not a Lucas number),\n\nk6=49 (not Lucas),\n\nk7=76 (L9=76),\n\nk8=224 (not Lucas). Hmm, so k2=L2, k3=L4, k7=L9, but others don't match. Maybe every other term?\n\nAlternatively, k(n) = L(2n) ?\n\nCheck L(4)=7 (n=2: L4=7, so k3=7 would be L4, so maybe k(n)=L(2n-2). Let me see:\n\nFor n=2, L(2)=3, so k2=3,\n\nn=3, L(4)=7, so k3=7,\n\nn=4, L(6)=18, but k4=8. Not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are a combination of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers?\n\nAlternatively, let me look at the higher terms given:\n\nk11=1155, k12=2683, k13=5765, k14=10544.\n\nLet me see the ratios between these:\n\nk14/k13\u22481.829,\n\nk13/k12\u22482.148,\n\nk12/k11\u22482.323,\n\nk11/k10? Wait, we don't have k10, but assuming the pattern from lower terms:\n\nIf the ratios are fluctuating between ~1.5 to ~2.3, it might not be directly related to \u03c6, unless there's another relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is a second-order linear recurrence with constant coefficients, which might have roots related to \u03c6?\n\nSuppose the recurrence is k(n) = a*k(n-1) + b*k(n-2). Let's try to find a and b.\n\nUsing the terms:\n\nGiven k2=3, k3=7, k4=8, k5=21, etc.\n\nUsing k4 = a*k3 + b*k2,\n\n8 = 7a +3b,\n\nSimilarly, using k5 = a*k4 + b*k3,\n\n21 =8a +7b.\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n7a +3b =8,\n\n8a +7b =21.\n\nLet me solve this system.\n\nMultiply first equation by7: 49a +21b =56,\n\nMultiply second by3:24a +21b=63,\n\nSubtract first from second: (24a +21b) - (49a +21b)=63-56 \u21d2-25a=7 \u21d2a= -7/25= -0.28,\n\nThen substitute back to first equation:\n\n7*(-0.28)+3b=8,\n\n-1.96 +3b=8 \u21d23b=9.96 \u21d2b\u22483.32,\n\nWhich matches the earlier result. So the recurrence relation is k(n)= -0.28*k(n-1)+3.32*k(n-2). Not very insightful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if we write the recurrence equation as k(n) = (a)*k(n-1) + (b)*k(n-2), then the characteristic equation is r\u00b2 - a r - b=0. The roots would be [a \u00b1 sqrt(a\u00b2 +4b)]/2.\n\nWith the values of a and b as above, the roots would be complex or real?\n\nPlugging in a\u2248-0.28, b\u22483.32,\n\nDiscriminant: (0.28)^2 +4*3.32\u22480.0784 +13.28\u224813.36,\n\nSo sqrt(13.36)\u22483.656,\n\nThus roots: [0.28 \u00b13.656]/2,\n\nSo one root: (0.28+3.656)/2\u22481.97,\n\nOther root: (0.28-3.656)/2\u2248-1.688,\n\nHmm, so the roots are approximately 1.97 and -1.688.\n\nWait, -1.688 is close to -\u03c6\u2248-1.618. Interesting, so one root is about -\u03c6, and the other is approx 2.\n\nSo maybe the recurrence is designed to have roots related to \u03c6 and 2?\n\nIndeed, if we suppose that the characteristic equation has roots r1=\u03c6 and r2= something else, but with approximate values matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a miscalculation, but the approximate roots are near -\u03c6 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact values are such that the recurrence is k(n) = ( (sqrt(5)-1)/2 )*k(n-1) + ( (3+sqrt(5))/2 )*k(n-2) or something, but that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined by a recurrence relation where the coefficients are related to \u03c6, but it's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, looking back at the problem statement: the user just provided the terms up to k8 and mentioned higher terms like k11, k12, etc., but the question is just to explain the relation with the golden ratio? The user might be asking for an analysis of how the sequence relates to the golden ratio, given that some terms like k5/k4\u2248\u03c6\u00b2 and k7/k6\u2248\u03c6.\n\nPerhaps the sequence is constructed such that every second term's ratio approaches \u03c6\u00b2 or \u03c6?\n\nAlternatively, since k5/k4\u2248\u03c6\u00b2 and k7/k6\u2248\u03c6, maybe alternating between ratios related to \u03c6\u00b2 and \u03c6?\n\nLooking at the next terms:\n\nIf the pattern continues, maybe k9/k8\u2248\u03c6\u00b2 again? Let's see:\n\nIf following the pattern:\n\nk5/k4\u2248\u03c6\u00b2,\n\nthen k7/k6\u2248\u03c6,\n\nthen k9/k8\u2248\u03c6\u00b2,\n\nthen k11/k10\u2248\u03c6,\n\nand so on.\n\nBut we can test with the given higher terms:\n\nk12/k11\u22482.323 which is close to \u03c6\u00b2\u22482.618? Not really. Wait, 2.323 is closer to \u03c6+1\u22482.618? No, \u03c6+1 is actually \u03c6\u00b2, since \u03c6\u00b2=\u03c6+1\u22482.618. Hmm, 2.323 is less than that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratios alternate approaching \u03c6 and something else?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratios approach \u03c6 in the long term? Let's see the higher ratios:\n\nk14/k13\u22481.829,\n\nk13/k12\u22482.148,\n\nk12/k11\u22482.323,\n\nIf the sequence continues, maybe the ratios approach \u03c6\u22481.618 from above and below?\n\nBut 1.829 is still higher than \u03c6, 2.148 even higher, 2.323, so seems not converging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is a different recurrence altogether.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a Fibonacci-type sequence starting with different initial terms. Let me try with k2=3 and k3=7, and see what the next terms would be with a Fibonacci-like recurrence:\n\nIf k(n)=k(n-1)+k(n-2):\n\nk4=7+3=10 (but actual k4=8),\n\nSo no.\n\nIf k(n)=k(n-1)+2k(n-2):\n\nk4=7+2*3=13 (but actual k4=8),\n\nNo.\n\nk(n)=2k(n-1) -k(n-2):\n\n2*7 -3=11 (actual 8),\n\nNo.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, k(n)=k(n-1)*something +k(n-2)*something else.\n\nFrom k4=8= a*7 + b*3,\n\nand k5=21=a*8 +b*7,\n\nSo two equations:\n\n7a +3b =8,\n\n8a +7b=21,\n\nWhich is the same as before, leading to a\u2248-0.28 and b\u22483.32.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms correspond to a different recurrence, but the question is to relate it to the golden ratio.\n\nGiven that some ratios are close to \u03c6\u00b2 and \u03c6, perhaps the sequence is designed such that every second ratio approaches \u03c6\u00b2 or \u03c6?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are Fibonacci numbers scaled by some factor?\n\nFor instance, k4=8=F6,\n\nk5=21=F8,\n\nk6=49=F10 (which is 55, close but not exact),\n\nHmm, F10 is 55, so 49 is less.\n\nAlternatively, k7=76=F9 (76 is actually F9=34, F10=55, F11=89, F12=144, so 76 is between F10 and F11 but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are every third Fibonacci number? Let's see:\n\nF4=3,\n\nF7=13,\n\nF10=55,\n\nF13=233,\n\nF16=987,\n\nNot matching the given terms.\n\nAlternatively, the terms might be related to the Fibonacci word or another structure, but that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the golden ratio properties. Since \u03c6\u00b2=\u03c6+1, maybe the recurrence relation is k(n)=k(n-1)+k(n-2), which is Fibonacci, but starting from different initial terms.\n\nWait, if we start with k1=3, k2=7,\n\nthen k3=10, but actual k3 is 8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is the Fibonacci sequence starting at F4=3, F6=8, F8=21, F10=55, F12=144, etc. But the given terms are 3,7,8,21,49,76,224. Hmm, 7 is not a Fibonacci number in that sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different sequence where every term is the sum of the previous term and twice the term before that, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, given that the problem mentions the golden ratio, and some ratios like k5/k4 \u224821/8\u22482.625 which is close to \u03c6\u00b2\u22482.618, and k7/k6\u224876/49\u22481.551 which is close to \u03c6\u22481.618, perhaps the sequence is constructed such that every odd term divided by the previous even term approximates \u03c6\u00b2, and every even term divided by the previous odd term approximates \u03c6.\n\nFor example:\n\nk5/k4 =21/8\u22482.625 \u2248\u03c6\u00b2,\n\nk3/k2=7/3\u22482.333, which is less close,\n\nk7/k6\u224876/49\u22481.551\u2248\u03c6,\n\nk5/k4\u22482.625\u2248\u03c6\u00b2,\n\nSo if we continue:\n\nk9/k8\u2248?\n\nIf following the pattern, k9 should be such that k9/k8\u2248\u03c6\u00b2,\n\nIf k8=224,\n\nthen k9\u2248224*\u03c6\u00b2\u2248224*2.618\u2248586.2,\n\nSimilarly, then k10/k9\u2248\u03c6\u22481.618,\n\nk10\u2248586.2*1.618\u2248947,\n\nThen k11/k10\u2248\u03c6\u00b2,\n\nk11\u2248947*2.618\u22482480,\n\nBut in the given data, k11=1155, which is much lower. Hmm, discrepancy here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is every other term's ratio approaches \u03c6?\n\nk3/k2=7/3\u22482.333,\n\nk5/k4\u22482.625,\n\nk7/k6\u22481.551,\n\nk9/k8\u2248?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, given that 21/8 is close to \u03c6\u00b2, and 76/49\u22481.55 is close to \u03c6 but a bit low,\n\nPerhaps the sequence is not exactly constructed for that, but the question is to notice the proximity.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be to observe that the ratios approach the golden ratio or its square.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence follows the recurrence relation k(n) = k(n-1) + k(n-2), but starting from k1=3 and k2=7,\n\nthen k3=10, k4=17, but given k4=8, so not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is k(n) = k(n-2) + 2*k(n-1),\n\nso:\n\nk4=2*7 +3=17, but actual k4=8,\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, k(n) = k(n-1) + k(n-2) - something,\n\nNot obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the fact that the indices correspond to Fibonacci numbers? For example, term 5 (which is 21) is F8=21, term7=76 isn't a Fibonacci number.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be expecting an explanation that certain ratios are close to the golden ratio, but given the provided terms, perhaps the key ratios are k5/k4\u2248\u03c6\u00b2 and k7/k6\u2248\u03c6.\n\nSince the user hasn't explicitly stated the question but mentions \"golden ratio\", likely the task is to recognize that some term ratios approximate \u03c6 or \u03c6\u00b2.\n\nGiven the problem statement is a bit unclear, but given the context, maybe the user is asking to explain the relation between the given sequence and the golden ratio, pointing out the close ratios.\n\nThus, the answer would note that the ratio of the 5th term to the 4th term (21/8 \u2248 2.625) is close to \u03c6\u00b2 (\u22482.618), and the ratio of the 7th term to the 6th term (76/49 \u22481.551) is close to \u03c6 (\u22481.618). Therefore, these ratios approximate the golden ratio and its square, indicating a connection to the golden ratio properties.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sequence exhibits ratios close to the golden ratio and its square, such as \\( \\frac{21}{8} \\approx \\phi^2 \\) and \\( \\frac{76}{49} \\approx \\phi \\). Thus, the answer is \\boxed{\\phi}.\n",
