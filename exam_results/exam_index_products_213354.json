There are various observations regarding keys, labelled as \"k5\", \"k7\", \"k8\", \"k9\", \"k11\", and \"k12\". The notation k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) where f(n) is some function that multiplies n (the index of the key) plus an offset g(n). We have specific values:\n- For key 5: there is observation: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" but then commentary \"(indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\". Not sure what exactly. Possibly it means that for some indices the product of previous keys equals a key.\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!). So they have: k12 = k8 * 12 - 5, and we know from the text: \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28\" so apparently k8 equals exactly 28 times index value? It says that 224/8=28. And k11 is given as k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? gives 1155/11=105 (i.e., integer) thus k11 = 105\u00d711, and then k12 = ? \u00d7 12+? but it was not clean division so they instead used the formula k8 * 12 - 5.\n\nWe are given: \"So k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711.\" It also says for k7: \"k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7=10.86 (not clean)\", similarly for k9: \"467/9=51.89\" not integer.\n\nWe are asked: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly the answer should be to derive f(n) from the given keys, using division by index? The values provided: \nk8: 224/8=28, so f(8)=28. k11: 1155/11 =105, so f(11)=105. k12: 2683/12 does not yield integer but equals 223.58... however they show that using alternative formula: k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 i.e. 28*12 - 5 = 336-5=331, but wait check: 28\u00d712=336 then minus 5 equals 331 but the text said \"2683\", so is it misprint? Let's check original text:\n\"CHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\n\nWait, the original text: \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" equals: if we use k8 = 28 then 28*12=336, minus 5 equals 331, not 2683. Perhaps there's a misprint with k8 vs k11? Let me re-read:\n\nThe text says:\n\"CHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\n\nWait, maybe the keys are not actually \"k\" times index? Possibly the numbers in parentheses like \"76\", \"224\", etc. represent some known product values? They might be computed from some formula.\n\nI see: \"k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86\". So likely k7 is 76, and dividing by 7 yields something non-integer (approx 10.857). Similarly, for k8, k8=224, which divided by 8 equals 28 exactly.\nFor k9, k9=467, which divided by 9 equals ~51.8889; not integer.\nFor k11, k11 = 1155, dividing by 11 yields 105 exactly.\nFor k12, k12 = 2683 according to the division? Wait, check: \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12=223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". This is contradictory: if k8 is used in the formula for k12 then maybe it's a different pattern.\n\nWe have a hypothesis that sometimes the index itself appears in the formula. Perhaps the general pattern is: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). And they want us to calculate f(n) for each key.\n\nMaybe f(7)=? Actually, we can compute f(n) by taking the known value of k_n and dividing by n if it's an integer result. For keys where division yields an integer, that integer is f(n).\n\nFor k8: 224/8=28 gives f(8)=28.\nFor k11: 1155/11=105 gives f(11)=105.\n\nFor keys 7 and 9 the results are non-integer so maybe there's not a neat pattern or perhaps there's another formula. For key 12, it's given that k12 equals k8 * 12 - 5 = 28*12 - 5 = 336 - 5=331. But wait, but the text says \"2683\" in division check. Possibly misprint: k12 might actually be 331 if we use the formula. Let me recalc: \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12=223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". There's a discrepancy: either the multiplication factor is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting: maybe k8 * 12 - 5 equals 28*12 - 5 = 336 - 5 = 331; then if that equals k12 then dividing by 12 gives 331/12 which is 27.5833... not matching 223.58. Possibly it's the other way around: maybe there is a misprint in the multiplication factor? Perhaps k8 is not 28 but something else.\n\nLet's re-read carefully:\n\"CHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\n\nWait, the statement \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" gives a result: 224 is being divided by 8 yields 28 exactly, so that's good.\n\nThen for key 11: dividing 1155 by 11 yields 105 exactly.\nFor key 12: They first try division and get 223.58 but then note \"but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". Wait a minute, maybe it means if you use the formula \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\", then for some keys, f(n) is not simply k_n / n because of the constant offset term.\n\nMaybe we have an observed pattern: Some keys follow the structure:\n- For k8 and k11, the structure fits with k_n = 28*8 (and 105*11). So f(8)=28 and f(11)=105.\nFor key 12, they mention a different formula: k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5. That is not of the form f(12)*12 + g(12) unless we can express that in such a way.\n\nLet's try to express k12 = (k8*12 - 5) and see if it can be written as f(12)*12 + g(12). For that, we need to know what k8 is. We have k8=28, so k12=28*12-5 = 336 - 5 = 331. And then 331/12 = 27.5833, not integer.\n\nSo for key 12, f(12) would be floor division or something: maybe f(12)=?\nWe have the hypothesis that sometimes index appears in formula, i.e., f(n) might equal some function of n and previous keys.\nObservations:\nk5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. So for key 5, it is a product of keys 2 and 3. So then does that fit pattern? If we write: k5 = f(5)*5 + g(5), can we find f(5)? Perhaps not.\n\nWe are asked \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly the answer is to list: \nFor n=7, f(7)= floor(76/7) maybe 10? But that's approximate.\nAlternatively, maybe they mean \"calculate f(n)\" as in derive a general formula for f(n) from pattern.\n\nMaybe we need more context. I'll assume we have keys k_n with known integer values for some indices:\nk2, k3 are used to compute k5 = k2 * k3. But we don't know what k2 and k3 are?\nWe are given: k8=224; k11=1155; k12=2683 (or 331 based on formula?) Let's re-read the original message carefully:\n\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\nIt looks like they are analyzing some key sequence, maybe it's the \"index product\" puzzle or similar.\n\nI suspect that we need to compute f(n) for n=7,8,9,11,12. And possibly also for other keys if available?\n\nFor those keys where division is integer, f(n)= k_n / n. So:\n- For k8: f(8)=224/8 = 28.\n- For k11: f(11)=1155/11=105.\n\nFor the others, maybe we want to solve for f(n) in terms of something else? Possibly f(n) is not defined by a simple division when g(n) is nonzero. The pattern seems inconsistent.\n\nMaybe the answer is: \"The function f(n), which multiplies the index n in the expression k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), appears to take integer values for some indices (namely 8 and 11) but not for others, indicating that the index sometimes directly influences the structure of the key. The computed values are:\n- For n=7: f(7) is approximately 10.86, but since it's non-integral, it does not fit.\n- For n=8: f(8)=28 exactly.\n- For n=9: f(9) is approximately 51.89.\n- For n=11: f(11)=105 exactly.\n- For n=12: Although the direct division gives about 223.58, using the relation k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 yields f(12)=? Let's solve that equation: if we want to write k12 in the form f(12)*12 + g(12), then compare with k8*12 - 5. But without knowing what f(12) is, we can rearrange: f(12)*12 = (k8*12 - 5) - g(12). Not clear.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for some keys, f(n)= product of primes or something?\n28 factors as 4*7; 105 factors as 3*5*7. And k2 and k3 might be 2 and 3? Then k5 = k2*k3=6 maybe, but then 6 does not equal any pattern.\n\nWait, \"k8 = 28\u00d78\" means f(8)=28, which is 4*7. k11 =105\u00d711 means f(11)=105, which equals 3*5*7? But 3*5*7=105 but then missing factor 2? Not sure.\n\nMaybe we are supposed to derive that sometimes the index n appears in the product structure of these keys. For instance: \nk8 seems to be 28 times 8, and k11 is 105 times 11, so f(8)=28, f(11)=105.\nWe might guess that for other indices, we can compute f(n) as floor(k_n/n)? But then the division for n=7 gives f(7) = floor(76/7)=10? Possibly g(7)=? Let's try to solve: if k7=76 and we assume it is of form 10*7 + remainder, that would be 70 plus remainder 6. So maybe f(7)=10 and g(7)=6.\nFor n=9: k9=467, so dividing by 9 gives 51 remainder 8 (since 51*9=459; remainder = 8). So then f(9) might be 51 and g(9)=8.\nBut wait, check division for n=12: If we use the formula k12 = k8\u00d712 -5, with k8=28 gives 28*12-5=336-5=331. Then if k12=331 then dividing by 12 gives 27 remainder 7 (since 27*12=324; remainder=7). So then f(12)=27 and g(12)=7.\nFor n=11: k11=1155, so that divides evenly giving 105 exactly. For n=8: k8=224, so 28 exactly.\n\nThus we have:\nn=7: f(7) = 10? But then 10*7 =70 and g(7)=76-70=6.\nn=8: f(8)=28; 28*8=224 so g(8)=0.\nn=9: f(9)=51; 51*9=459, remainder 467-459=8.\nn=11: f(11)=105; no remainder.\nn=12 (if using the alternative formula): f(12)=27 with remainder 7. But then why does the division earlier give 2683/12? That is totally different.\n\nWait a minute: There's inconsistency: It says \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58...\" but then later it says \"but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". So which one is correct for k12? Possibly the first check (2683/12) is when using the assumed pattern f(n)*n + g(n), and that gave a non integer quotient, suggesting that for n=12, the index does not appear in the formula directly. But then they note that if we use a different relation: k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5, which equals 2683. That implies that perhaps the intended pattern is that sometimes the key is formed by multiplying another key (like k8) by the current index and then subtracting a constant.\n\nSo maybe the answer should say: \"For n=7, f(7)=10 with remainder 6; for n=8, f(8)=28 exactly; for n=9, f(9)=51 with remainder 8; for n=11, f(11)=105 exactly; and for n=12, if we use the relation k12 = k8\u00d712 -5, then f(12) is not given by a simple division but can be rearranged as: f(12)= (k8*12-5)/12. Given that k8=28, this yields f(12)= (28*12-5)/12 = (336-5)/12=331/12 which is not an integer, so the pattern does not hold.\" Alternatively, if we reinterpret \"2683\" as the actual value of k12 when expressed in form f(n)*n + g(n), then dividing 2683 by 12 gives approximately 223.5833, so f(12)=223 and remainder 7 (since 223*12=2676; remainder 7). But then why mention k8\u00d712 -5? Because 28*12-5 = 331, not 2683.\n\nLet me re-read the check: \"5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". It might be that for key 12, the pattern is that you multiply k8 by 12 and then subtract 5, which gives 2683, so that expression can also be seen as (f(8)*? plus something). This is very confusing.\n\nPerhaps I should re-read the whole prompt carefully:\n\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product yields index 5?)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\nIt seems that they are trying to see if the keys can be expressed as f(n)*n + something, where sometimes f(n) equals an integer.\n\nFor key 7: It is not \"clean\" because 76 divided by 7 gives 10.857...\nFor key 8: 224/8 = 28 exactly.\nFor key 9: 467/9 \u2248 51.888... (maybe it's meant to be 52? Because 52*9=468, then g(9)=-1, but that doesn't seem likely.)\nFor key 11: 1155/11 = 105 exactly.\nFor key 12: 2683 divided by 12 \u2248 223.583... (maybe it's meant to be 224? Because 224*12=2688, then g(12)=-5; that would match the pattern k8\u00d712 -5 if k8 were 28? Actually, 28*12-5 =336-5=331, not 2688. Alternatively, maybe f(12)=223 and remainder 7, i.e., 223*12+7=2676+7=2683)\n\nSo possible corrected values: \nk7 might be 10\u00d77 + 6 = 70 + 6 = 76.\nk9 might be 52\u00d79 - 1 =468 - 1 =467.\nk11 is 105\u00d711 +0 =1155.\nk12 is 223\u00d712 +7 =2676+7=2683.\n\nAnd for k8, it's 28\u00d78+0.\n\nSo then f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=52, f(11)=105, f(12)=223. And the remainders (g(n)) would be: g(7)=6, g(8)=0, g(9)=-1? But usually remainder should be nonnegative if we are using division algorithm. Let me check: For k9=467, dividing by 9: quotient = 51 and remainder 8 (since 51*9=459, remainder 8), but then that doesn't equal 52. Alternatively, maybe f(7)=11? Because 11\u00d77=77 which is too high. Let's solve linear equations: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) with 0 \u2264 g(n) < n typically.\nFor k7=76, if we let quotient be Q and remainder R with 0 <= R < 7 then 76/7 gives Q=10 remainder 6 because 10*7=70, remainder=6. So f(7)=10, g(7)=6.\nFor k8=224, division yields 28 remainder 0. So f(8)=28, g(8)=0.\nFor k9=467, 9*51 =459, remainder 8; so f(9)=51, g(9)=8.\nFor k11=1155, 11*105=1155, so remainder=0, so f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\nFor k12=2683, dividing by 12: 12*223 =2676, remainder 7; so f(12)=223, g(12)=7.\n\nNow look at the pattern of f(n): 10, 28, 51, 105, 223. They don't seem to follow a simple arithmetic progression. The differences are: 18 (from 10 to 28), then 23 (28 to 51), then 54 (51 to 105), then 118 (105 to 223). Not obviously pattern.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that sometimes f(n) equals k_{n-?} times something.\nNotice: For n=8, f(8)=28. For n=11, f(11)=105. And for n=12, if we use the relation given: k12 = k8\u00d712 -5 then using k8=224? Let's check that possibility: If we take k8 as 224, then k8\u00d712 =2688, and subtract 5 gives 2683. Then maybe f(12) would be 223 if we divide by 12, remainder 7.\n\nNow consider the products:\nk2 and k3 used for k5. What are k2 and k3? Possibly they might be computed similarly: Maybe k2 = ?; k3=?.\nIf we assume a pattern: maybe k2= ? such that when multiplied gives k5. But we don't have values for those.\n\nMaybe the answer is simply to state:\nf(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, f(12)=223.\nAnd note that these correspond exactly to the quotient parts when expressing each key as f(n)*n + g(n) in base n.\n\nTherefore, the answer: \nFor k7 = 76, we have f(7) = 10 and remainder 6.\nFor k8 = 224, f(8)=28 exactly.\nFor k9 = 467, f(9)=51 with a remainder of 8.\nFor k11=1155, f(11)=105 exactly.\nFor k12 (using the alternative representation as 2683) gives f(12)=223 and remainder 7.\n\nBut then what about \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\"? That might be another pattern: f(5) is determined by multiplying some earlier terms. But we don't have numerical values for k2, k3.\n\nMaybe the answer should just be: \nf(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=52? Wait, check division for 467/9: 9*51=459, remainder 8; but if we try 9*52 =468, then remainder -1 which is not allowed. So it must be 51.\n\nSo final answer: \nk7: quotient 10 (since 10\u00d77 +6 =76)\nk8: quotient 28\nk9: quotient 51\nk11: quotient 105\nk12: quotient 223\n\nThus, the \"f(n)\" values for n=7,8,9,11,12 are 10, 28, 51, 105, and 223 respectively.\n\nI will now produce a final answer in plain text.</think>We can \u201creverse\u2010engineer\u201d many of the keys by writing each one in the form\n\n\u2003\u2003key = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n)\n\u2003\u2003with 0 \u2264 g(n) < n.\n\nFor example, suppose that for some index n we know\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = (an integer)\u00d7n plus a \u201cremainder.\u201d\n\nOne set of examples is as follows. (In what follows the numbers k\u2087, k\u2088, \u2026 are given by the puzzle.)\n\n\u2022 For index 7 the key is 76. Dividing 76 by 7 we have\n\u2003\u200376 = 10\u00d77 + 6.\nThus one may take f(7) = 10 (with remainder g(7) = 6).\n\n\u2022 For index 8 the key is 224. Here\n\u2003\u2003224 = 28\u00d78 + 0,\nso f(8) = 28 exactly.\n\n\u2022 For index 9 the key is 467. Dividing by 9 gives\n\u2003\u2003467 = 51\u00d79 + 8\u2003\u2003(since 51\u00d79 = 459 and 467 \u2013 459 = 8),\nso f(9) = 51.\n\n\u2022 For index 11 the key is 1155. Notice that\n\u2003\u20031155 = 105\u00d711 + 0,\nso f(11)=105 exactly.\n\n\u2022 Finally, for index 12 one may write the key in two ways. One check gives\n\u2003\u20032683 = 223\u00d712 + 7\u2003\u2003(because 223\u00d712 = 2676 and 2683 \u2013 2676 = 7),\nso f(12)=223.\nMoreover, the puzzle tells us that another way to \u201csee\u201d k\u2081\u2082 is as\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = (k\u2088 \u00d7 12) \u2013 5.\nSince we already found k\u2088 = 224, indeed\n\u2003\u2003224\u00d712 \u2013 5 = 2688 \u2013 5 = 2683,\nwhich confirms the number.\n\nThus one acceptable answer is to take\n\n\u2003\u2003f(7)=10,\u2003f(8)=28,\u2003f(9)=51,\u2003f(11)=105,\u2003and\u2003f(12)=223.\n\nThis shows that in many cases the \u201ccoefficient\u201d f(n) turns out to be an integer (with a remainder g(n)) when we write the key as a multiple of n plus something extra. (And note that for k\u2085 the puzzle tells us k\u2085 = k\u2082\u00d7k\u2083 so its structure is different.) \n\nAny answer which explains that when you \u201cdivide\u201d k\u2087, k\u2088, \u2026 by their indices you get these f(n) values is correct.",
