Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nWe are given some sample keys: k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12 etc. Let's parse the problem carefully.\n\nThe question says \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\" then gives observed facts like \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\" which might be misinterpretation: Actually text is \"OBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\". It's unclear what it means exactly.\n\nMaybe the observation is that for some key indices there's a pattern like: For index n, maybe k_n equals to something like f(n)*n + g(n) where f and g are functions of n. The provided examples:\n\nk8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (so the formula would be f(8)=? Possibly then we can say: if k8 = 28 * 8, then f(8) is 28. And maybe g(8)=0 in that case.\nk11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!) so k11=105*11 so f(11)=105 and likely again g(11)=0.\nFor k12, they said 2683/12=223.58... but then they mention \"but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". So that's interesting: For k12, we see the pattern is not simply of the form f(n)*n + g(n) with integer quotient? But if we use k8 in formula: it becomes k12 = (k8 \u00d7 12 - 5). And since k8 was computed as 28*8 =224, then k8\u00d712 -5= 2688-5= 2683. So that fits.\n\nWhat about the others?\nObservations:\nMaybe they are trying to see if there is a pattern where index appears in formula: maybe for some n, k_n = (some product of earlier keys times n) plus something? The check includes \"k7\" and \"k9\", which did not yield clean quotient when dividing by 7 or 9.\n\nSpecifically:\nk7 = ?\u00d77 + ? \u2192 76/7 \u2248 10.857 so maybe that one is not in the pattern.\nk8 gives integer: 224=28*8, meaning f(8)=28.\nk9 yields 467/9 which is non-integer\nk11 yields 1155/11=105, so f(11)=105.\nk12 yields 2683/12 is not integer, but note that it equals k8\u00d712 -5.\n\nSo the hypothesis is: maybe for some keys, k_n can be expressed as f(n)*n + g(n), where f and g are functions of n. The question asks \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So what keys? Possibly k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12 etc.\n\nWe have some given values: \nk2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, and maybe others. But not all are provided explicitly except for the ones with formulas? Let's see details:\n\n\"Observed: - k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\". That seems confusing text.\n\nWait, let me re-read:\n\"\nINDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n\"\n\nIt says \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Likely the keys are known values: \nk2, k3, k4? But only provided numbers: k7=76, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, k12=2683.\nAlso possibly k5 = ? Possibly we need to check from pattern: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" maybe then k5 = 15 *? But not sure.\n\nWe also see the hypothesis \"k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)\" for each key. So we want to solve for f(n)? But what is given? The examples:\n\nFor n=7: if we assume form: k7 = f(7)*7 + g(7), then 76/7=10.857142857 which doesn't yield an integer quotient, so maybe f(7) is not integer or the decomposition with a remainder exists.\nFor n=8: k8 = 224 = f(8)*8 + g(8). And they found that 224/8=28 exactly, so that suggests f(8)=28 and g(8)=0 if we assume g(n) is defined as something like that.\nFor n=9: 467/9=51.888... so not integer.\nFor n=11: k11 = 1155 = f(11)*11 + g(11), but 1155/11=105 exactly, so then f(11)=105 and g(11)=0.\nFor n=12: k12 = 2683 doesn't divide evenly by 12, but we see a relationship with k8: 2683= (k8\u00d712-5). And since k8 is 224, that gives 224*12 -5 =2688-5=2683. That pattern might be: sometimes the product is not \"f(n) \u00d7 n\" exactly because there's an extra term.\n\nMaybe we can guess a possible formula for f(n): maybe f(2)? But what are k2 and k3? Possibly they are known from some sequence?\n\nMaybe these keys represent numbers in a known sequence? The pattern might be: k2, k3, k5, etc. We have:\n- k7=76\n- k8=224\n- k9=467\n- k11=1155\n- k12=2683\nWe also see \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\", so maybe that gives a relationship between keys. If we assume keys are indexed by integers and the pattern might be related to some product or combination.\n\nMaybe these keys come from something like \"Index Product\" where each key is computed based on previous ones? The notation \"k_n\" might mean the nth key in a sequence, and there's an observed property: sometimes you can write k_n = f(n) * n + g(n), where either f(n) or g(n) are determined by previous keys.\n\nLet's try to see if we can deduce what f(7) is? If k7=76, then the representation 76 = f(7)*7 + g(7). Without additional constraints, maybe f(7)= ? But perhaps there is pattern: for even indices like 8 and 11 (both are odd though, 11 is odd too) they yield integer quotient. So maybe f(n) is defined as the quotient when dividing k_n by n if it divides evenly; otherwise it might be something else.\n\nMaybe we can calculate f(n)=floor(k_n/n)? But that doesn't seem like a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's known sequence: k7=76, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, k12=2683. Let me see if these numbers are familiar? 224 is 7*32 maybe or something.\n- 76 = ? \n- 224 = 28 * 8\n- 467 seems prime-ish? Actually 467 divided by 7 gives 66.714, divided by 11 gives about 42.45, so no.\n- 1155 factorizes: 3*5*7*11 maybe? Because 1155=3\u00d7385 or 5\u00d7231... Let me factor: 1155/5 =231, and 231= 3*77=3*7*11. So 1155=3*5*7*11.\n- 2683 factors? Possibly it's prime.\n\nThe observation \"k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5\" suggests that sometimes the formula uses a product of an earlier key and the index, minus a constant.\n\nMaybe these keys are part of a recurrence or pattern known as \"index product pattern analysis\". The provided information is sparse. I must decide what is being asked: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly meaning: given k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), find f(7), f(8), f(9), f(11), f(12)? But then they already computed some divisions: \nFor n=8, 224/8=28 so f(8)=28.\nFor n=11, 1155/11 =105 so f(11)=105.\nFor n=7 and n=9, the division is not integer. So maybe we need to consider that maybe g(n) is not zero in those cases.\n\nMaybe the pattern: k_n = (k_{something} * n) + constant. For example, k12 uses k8 in its formula, i.e., f(12)=? Possibly 2683/12 yields non-integer quotient. But if we express it as (k8*12 -5), then that is of the form: k_n = something \u00d7 n + something else. So for n=12, maybe we define f(12) to be k8? Not exactly.\n\nMaybe the hypothesis \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula\" suggests that sometimes the factor multiplying n is derived from another key's value (like k8 appears in k12).\n\nI can try to solve: For each n, assume there exist functions f(n) and g(n) such that:\n\nk_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\n\nWe are given:\nFor n=7: 76 = f(7)*7 + g(7)\nFor n=8: 224 = f(8)*8 + g(8). And we already know that 224/8 =28 exactly, so it might be that f(8)=28 and g(8)=0.\nFor n=9: 467 = f(9)*9 + g(9)\nFor n=11: 1155 = f(11)*11 + g(11) with quotient integer, so f(11)=105 and g(11)=0.\nFor n=12: 2683 = f(12)*12 + g(12), but then they note that 2683 = k8\u00d712 -5. And since k8=224, we have 224*12=2688, so g(12) must be -5.\n\nSo from these, we can deduce: \n- f(8)=28 and f(11)=105.\nFor n=7: We don't know if it divides evenly by 7. 76/7 =10 remainder 6 (since 7*10=70, remainder 6), so one possibility is f(7)=10 and g(7)=6. But then check pattern: maybe f(n) might be defined as the quotient of k_n divided by n if there's no leftover? But for n=7, it gives a non-integer division though. Possibly we define f(7) = floor(76/7)=10 and g(7)= remainder 6. Similarly for n=9: 467/9 =51 remainder 8 (since 9*51=459, remainder 8). So then f(9)=51 and g(9)=8.\n\nBut maybe the pattern is different? Let me check: The hypothesis \"Sometimes the INDEX appears in the formula\" might mean that sometimes when you express k_n as f(n)*n + g(n), the function f(n) may be computed using other keys. For instance, for n=12, they used k8 (which is at index 8) and multiplied by n=12 to get k12 plus a constant -5. And then k11 was computed as f(11)*11 with no extra term.\n\nSo maybe the pattern: \n- For prime indices or composite indices? Not sure.\nMaybe we can infer from other parts of the analysis that if k_n is divisible by n exactly, then g(n)=0; otherwise, there's a remainder. So then for each key we have:\nk2 = ? (we don't know value)\nk3 = ?\nk5 = ? and is equal to k2 \u00d7 k3.\nMaybe we can calculate them? But the user message only provides explicit values: k7=76, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, k12=2683. And also a relation for k5: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\". That might allow us to deduce something if we had values for k2 and k3.\n\nMaybe the sequence is known? Let me see possible pattern:\nThe indices that are prime: 7, 11 appear with quotient integer. For n=8 which is composite, it also divides evenly. For n=9 (composite) does not divide evenly. For n=12, there's a different formula.\nMaybe the pattern is: if n mod something equals something then f(n)=? Possibly f(n) = k_{n - ?} ?\n\nWait \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" suggests maybe when index 5 appears, it's product of keys at indices 2 and 3. That might be analogous to how we have k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5, which involves index 12 and key at index 8.\nMaybe the pattern: if n is prime or composite? Not sure.\n\nGiven that \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" is ambiguous unless we assume some base definitions. Possibly what they want is to define function f(n)= floor(k_n / n)? But then for n=7, floor(76/7)=10, n=8: 28, n=9: floor(467/9)=51, n=11:105, n=12: floor(2683/12) =223. So that would yield f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and f(12)=223.\n\nBut wait 2683/12 = 223 remainder something: Actually 12*223=2676, remainder 7, but we already got remainder -5 from the other expression. Wait check: 2683/12 is not exactly 223 remainder, because 12*223=2676, remainder 7, so that would be f(12)=223 and g(12)=? Actually if we want k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then for n=12, if we take the integer division quotient as f(n), it would be 223 with remainder 2683 - 223*12 = 2683-2676=7. But we already had an expression: k12 = k8 * 12 -5, and since k8=224, that equals 2688-5=2683. That gives a different structure because then f(12) would be k8=224? But then g(12)=-5.\n\nMaybe the idea is that sometimes the factor multiplying n is not given by the quotient when dividing k_n by n; it might come from a previous key value, like for index 12 it's k8, and for index 11 maybe it's something similar. So perhaps f(n) is defined piecewise: \n- For n=7, k7=76 can be written as (k2? or something?) But no relation given.\n\nWait, the problem statement \"Index Product Pattern Analysis\" might refer to a known puzzle where keys are arranged in an index grid and you compute products based on indices. Possibly f(n) is defined by dividing the key by its index if that division is exact; otherwise it's computed as something like: if n > 5 then maybe f(n)= k_{n-?} or similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intended answer is simply to show the values: \nf(7) = 10 (since 76=10*7+6)\nf(8) = 28 (224=28*8)\nf(9) = 51 (467=51*9+8)\nf(11)=105 (1155=105*11)\nand for n=12, since it's given by the formula k12=k8\u00d712 -5, then we can write it as 2683=224\u00d712 -5, which is of the form f(12)*12 + g(12) with f(12)=224 and g(12)=-5.\n\nBut then what about n=2,3,5? Possibly similar pattern:\nk5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. And maybe there are known values for k2 and k3 that come from somewhere else.\n\nI recall a puzzle \"Multiplicative Persistence of the Index\", but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps these keys are the outputs of a function f(n) where n is the index, and we want to calculate f(7)=? Given the expression for 12 using 8, maybe there's a recurrence: k_n = k_{n-4} * n - something. Check: k12 = k8*12 -5, then what about k11? It doesn't follow that pattern though.\n\nMaybe we assume that f(n) is defined as the unique integer such that k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), and if division is exact, then g(n)=0; otherwise, use the quotient from dividing by n. That gives: \nFor k7=76, 76/7 = 10 remainder 6 \u2192 so f(7)=10, g(7)=6.\nFor k8=224, exactly divisible by 8 \u2192 f(8)=28, g(8)=0.\nFor k9=467, 467/9 = 51 remainder 8 \u2192 f(9)=51, g(9)=8.\nFor k11=1155, 1155/11 =105 exactly \u2192 f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\nFor k12=2683, 2683/12 =223 remainder 7 (if doing integer division) or using the given formula gives 224 as factor and -5 offset. So which one is correct? The observation \"k12=k8\u00d712 -5\" suggests that in this case f(12)=k8, but then k8=224, and then g(12)=-5.\n\nSo maybe we have two ways to express it: if division yields an integer, use quotient; if not, sometimes the factor is given by a previous key. For n=7 and 9, it's just the floor of division.\n\nWe might try to see if there's any consistency: for n=12, using integer division we'd get f(12)=223 and remainder 2683 - 223*12 = 2683-2676=7, so that would be consistent with a \"remainder\" interpretation. But then why mention k8 in the formula? It might be because when you compute k12, the factor multiplying n is not computed by dividing k12 by 12, but rather is given by k8 (which itself has been computed as 28*8). So maybe there's an alternate representation: sometimes f(n) equals a previous key. For instance, for n=12, f(12)=k8. And perhaps similarly, for n=11, f(11) might equal something like k? But we already got 105 which is not obviously related to any other key.\n\nLet's check possibility: maybe the pattern is that f(n) itself can be computed from a relation involving indices and keys. For example, k7 = ? Possibly f(7)=k2? But then 76= something doesn't match.\n\nI wonder if there's a known sequence: The numbers 76, 224, 467, 1155, 2683. They seem to be related by differences: \n224-76=148; 467-224=243; 1155-467=688; 2683-1155=1528.\nDifferences: 148, 243, 688, 1528. Not obvious.\n\nRatios:\n224/76 \u22482.947, 467/224\u22482.085, 1155/467\u22482.472, so no.\n\nMaybe these numbers come from a puzzle where keys are arranged in an index grid: \"Index Product Pattern\" suggests that the key at position (i,j) is computed as something like product of indices? For instance, if you have a multiplication table and then add some constant maybe.\n\nConsider possibility: k_n might be defined by: k_n = n * f(n) + g(n), where f(n)=? Perhaps f(n) itself follows the pattern of the multiplication table entries corresponding to row index something. \nFor n=8, 224/8 =28 which is 7*4, maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can assume the simplest: f(n) is defined as the quotient when dividing k_n by n if that division is exact; otherwise it is the nearest integer? That gives:\nf(7)=floor(76/7)=10, but then remainder 6.\nf(8)=28 exactly,\nf(9)=51 (remainder 8),\nf(11)=105 exactly,\nf(12) from integer division gives 223 with remainder 7. But the provided note \"k12 = k8\u00d712 -5\" seems to suggest that instead of writing it as 223*12 + 7, one might prefer to express it in terms of a previous key: f(12)=224 and g(12)=-5.\n\nMaybe then f(n) is not uniquely determined by division; there's a choice in representation. The phrase \"Sometimes the INDEX appears in the formula\" might mean that sometimes you see the index as a multiplier, like in k12 where 12 multiplies k8.\n\nCould it be that f(n)=k_{n-4} for n=12? Because 12-4=8, so k8=224. Maybe more generally, f(n)= k_{n-4}? Let's test: For n=11, then k7 should equal f(11) if that pattern held, but k7 is given as 76, not 105. So no.\n\nMaybe f(n)=k_{n-?} doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intended answer: \nFor key 7: f(7)=10, for key 8: f(8)=28, for key 9: f(9)=51, for key 11: f(11)=105, and for key 12: f(12)=224 (using the alternative representation k12=k8\u00d712 -5).\n\nI should provide a clear answer explaining these.\n\nI can say:\nAssuming each key can be expressed as k_n = f(n)*n + g(n),\n- For n=7, since 76 \u00f7 7 gives quotient 10 and remainder 6, we have f(7)=10.\n- For n=8, because 224 is divisible by 8 (224 = 28\u00d78), we set f(8)=28 and g(8)=0.\n- For n=9, dividing 467 by 9 gives quotient 51 with remainder 8, so f(9)=51.\n- For n=11, since 1155 is divisible by 11 (1155 =105\u00d711), we have f(11)=105.\n- For n=12, although 2683 divided by 12 gives a non-integral quotient, the observed pattern shows k12 can be expressed as 224\u00d712 - 5. This representation implies that in this case, we choose to take f(12)=224 and g(12) = -5.\n\nThus, the computed values of f(n) for the keys provided are:\nf(7) = 10,\nf(8) = 28,\nf(9) = 51,\nf(11) = 105,\nand an alternative representation for key 12 yields f(12) = 224 (with a negative offset g(12) = -5).\n\nI can also mention that the pattern suggests sometimes k_n is exactly divisible by n, and other times it's expressed using a previous key value multiplied by n plus a constant.\n\nThat would be my answer. I'll produce final answer accordingly in plain text.\n\nI'll now produce final answer with explanation.</think>One acceptable way to \u201cread\u201d the keys is to write each one as\n\n\u2003\u2003key = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n).\n\nThen you notice that sometimes n divides the key exactly (so that g(n)=0) and other times it does not. For example, using the given numbers:\n\n\u2022\u2003For key 7 we have\n\u2003\u200376 = ?\u00b77 + remainder.\nDividing 76 by 7 gives a quotient of 10 with remainder 6, so one may take f(7)=10 (with g(7)=6).\n\n\u2022\u2003For key 8:\n\u2003\u2003224 is exactly divisible by 8 since 224 = 28\u00d78. Thus one takes f(8)=28 and g(8)=0.\n\n\u2022\u2003For key 9:\n\u2003\u2003467 divided by 9 gives a quotient of 51 with remainder 8, so we may take f(9)=51 (and g(9)=8).\n\n\u2022\u2003For key 11:\n\u2003\u20031155 = 105\u00d711 exactly, so one takes f(11)=105 and g(11)=0.\n\n\u2022\u2003For key 12:\nOne observation is that the key can be written in a \u201cnice\u201d way using a previous key value. In fact it is given that\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = k\u2088 \u00d7 12 \u2013 5.\nSince k\u2088 = 224, we have\n\u2003\u20032683 = 224\u00d712 \u2013 5.\nThis shows an alternative representation where one may choose to \u201cfactor out\u201d the 12 by taking f(12)=224 and g(12)=\u20135 (instead of writing 2683 = 223\u00d712 + 7, which is equally correct numerically but does not exhibit the pattern that sometimes a previous key appears in the formula).\n\nThus one acceptable answer is to say that when writing\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n),\n\nwe obtain:\n\u2003\u2003f(7)=10,\u2003f(8)=28,\u2003f(9)=51,\u2003f(11)=105,\nand in the special case n=12 one may also write\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 224\u00d712 \u2013 5\u2003(i.e. f(12)=224 with g(12)=\u20135).\n\nAny answer that shows this kind of analysis is correct.",
