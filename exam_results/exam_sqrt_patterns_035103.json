  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user has given some observed square root patterns for different keys (k5 to k16) and wants me to analyze and find similar patterns for k14, k15, and k16. Let me start by understanding the given information and then proceed to each of the questions.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given data points:\n\n- **k13** = k\u2087\u00b2 - 11 = 5776 - 11 = 5765. So, k\u2087 is 76, since 76\u00b2 is 5776. That's why \u221ak\u2081\u2083 \u2248 75.93, which is close to 76 (k\u2087). The user mentions that this is close but not exactly an integer.\n\nNow, looking at the other keys:\n\n1. **k5**: \u221a21 \u2248 4.58, not integer.\n2. **k6**: \u221a49 = 7, which is exactly k3 (since k3\u00b2 = 49, so k3 must be 7). So, k6 is a perfect square of k3.\n3. **k8**: \u221a224 \u2248 14.97, close to 15.\n4. **k11**: \u221a1155 \u2248 33.98, close to 34.\n5. **k13**: As above.\n6. **k14**: \u221a10544 \u2248 102.68.\n\nThe user wants to know if there are other square-based formulas for k14, k15, and k16. Let me go through each of them.\n\n---\n\n### **Investigating k14**\nThe square root of k14 is approximately 102.68. The question is, is this number close to another key? Let me see. The keys given are up to k16, but maybe the closest key before k14? Let me check:\n\n- The square root of k14 is ~102.68. If there's a key around 102 or 103, that might be relevant. But since the keys start from k1 up to k16, but the values of the keys might not be sequential. Wait, actually, the keys are labeled as k5 to k16, so perhaps each k corresponds to some value, but the actual numerical values of the keys (like k5 is 21, k6 is 49, etc.) may not necessarily follow an order. Let me see:\n\nWait, actually, in the problem statement, they refer to \"k13 = k7\u00b2 - 11\", so the keys are variables (k5, k6, etc.) with numerical values. The user is asking for patterns where a key is a square of another key minus some constant, or near a square.\n\nSo, for k14, they have \u221ak14 \u2248 102.68. The question is: is 102.68 close to another key (like k10 or k11?), but the keys listed in the observed data are up to k13. Alternatively, maybe it's close to a square of another key. Let's see:\n\n102.68 is close to 103. Let me see what 103 squared is: 103\u00b2 = 10609. The value of k14 is 10544, so 10609 - 10544 = 65. So, k14 \u2248 (103)^2 - 65. But that might not be a pattern they want. Alternatively, maybe it's related to another key?\n\nWait, let's see if 102.68 is related to a previous key. Let me see the keys again:\n\n- k7 is 76 (since k7 squared is 5776, so k7=76)\n- k3 is 7 (since k6=49=7\u00b2)\n- k8 is 224 (so sqrt(k8)=~14.97 close to 15)\n- k11 is 1155 (sqrt\u224833.98 close to 34)\n- k13 is 5765 (sqrt\u224875.93 close to 76, which is k7)\n- k14 is 10544 (sqrt\u2248102.68, close to 103?)\n\nSo maybe 102.68 is close to 103, but is there a key that is 103? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps 102.68 is close to k12? But k12's value isn't given here. Wait, maybe the keys are numbered in order. Let's see:\n\nWait, actually, the problem mentions \"k15 = k8\u00b2 - C\". Since k8 is 224, so 224 squared is 50176, so k15 = 50176 - C. The user wants C such that k15 is in [16384, 32767]. Wait, but 224 squared is 50176, which is above 32767. So, if k15 is supposed to be in that range, then C would have to be 50176 - k15. Wait, but that might not be helpful unless we know k15's value.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured such that each k is a square of another key minus a constant. The given example is k13 = k7\u00b2 - 11, which is 76\u00b2 -11 = 5765. So, the pattern is k_n = (some previous k)^2 minus a small constant. The user wants similar patterns for k14, k15, k16.\n\nFirst, need to figure out what the values of these keys (k14, k15, k16) are. Wait, in the observed data, the user only gives the square roots and the approximate values. Wait, actually, let me check again:\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"OBSERVED: k13 = k7\u00b2 - 11 = 5776 - 11 = 5765\"\n\nThen the \"CHECK EACH\" section lists square roots and the keys:\n\n1. \u221ak5 = \u221a21 \u22484.58 (so k5 is 21)\n2. \u221ak6 = \u221a49 =7 (so k6 is 49)\n3. \u221ak8 =\u221a224 (so k8 is 224)\n4. \u221ak11=\u221a1155 (so k11 is 1155)\n5. \u221ak13=\u221a5765 (so k13 is 5765)\n6. \u221ak14=\u221a10544 (so k14 is 10544)\n\nWait, so actually the values of the keys are given implicitly here:\n\n- k5 = 21\n\n- k6 =49\n\n- k8=224\n\n- k11=1155\n\n- k13=5765\n\n- k14=10544\n\nBut the question is about k14, k15, and k16. So, we need their values to analyze, but perhaps the user is following a pattern where each k is defined in terms of others. Wait, the problem mentions \"Find square patterns for k14, k15, k16\".\n\nWait, perhaps the keys are part of a sequence where each term is based on a square? Let me see:\n\nGiven the examples:\n\n- k6 = k3\u00b2 (since \u221ak6=7 implies k3 is 7, so k3\u00b2 =49=k6)\n\n- k13 = k7\u00b2 -11 (since k7=76, so 76\u00b2=5776, minus 11 gives 5765)\n\nSimilarly, maybe other keys follow similar patterns.\n\nFirst, let me list the keys with their known values:\n\nk3 =7 (since k6=49=7\u00b2)\n\nk7=76 (since k13=5765=76\u00b2 -11)\n\nk5=21\n\nk8=224\n\nk11=1155\n\nk13=5765\n\nk14=10544\n\nNow, the user wants to find square patterns for k14, k15, k16. Let me see if I can find relationships between these numbers and previous keys.\n\nStarting with k14 (10544):\n\nThe square root is \u2248102.68. Let me see if this is close to any existing key's square root or another key's value.\n\nLooking at previous keys:\n\n- k7 is 76, so 76\u00b2 is 5776 (k13 is close to that)\n\n- k8 is 224, sqrt(k8)=14.97 (~15)\n\n- k11 is 1155, sqrt\u224833.98 (~34)\n\n- k14 is 10544, sqrt\u2248102.68 (~103)\n\nHmm, 102.68 is close to 103. Let me see if 103 squared is 10609, so 10609 -10544=65, so k14=103\u00b2 -65. Is 65 a significant number here? Maybe, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, is there another key that is close?\n\nAlternatively, could it be related to another previous key?\n\nLooking at k11=1155. sqrt(k11)=33.98. Let me see 34\u00b2=1156. So, 34\u00b2 -1 =1155, which is exactly k11. Wait a minute! So k11=34\u00b2 -1 = 1156 -1 =1155. That's a neat pattern! So, the user might have missed that observation. Let me check:\n\nYes, 34 squared is 1156, so 1156 -1 is 1155. That's exactly k11. So that's a square-based formula: k11 = (34)\u00b2 -1, where 34 is close to the sqrt(k11). But in the original problem, the user only noted that sqrt(k11) is ~33.98 close to 34, but actually it's exactly 34\u00b2 -1. That's a better pattern.\n\nSimilarly, k13 is k7\u00b2 -11. Here, k7 is 76, and 76 squared is 5776, so 5776 -11=5765=k13.\n\nSimilarly, k6 is 7 squared (k3=7), so k6=k3\u00b2.\n\nSo, maybe k11 is following the same pattern: k11 = (34)^2 -1, but 34 is one more than the sqrt(k11) (since sqrt(1155) \u224833.98). But actually, 34 is exactly the next integer.\n\nSo perhaps for k14, we can see if it's a square of an integer minus some number.\n\nsqrt(k14)=102.68, so the nearest integer is 103. Let's compute 103\u00b2 = 10609. Then, 10609 - k14 = 10609 -10544 = 65. So, k14 = 103\u00b2 -65.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's related to another key. Let me see if 103 is a key? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps 102.68 is close to k12? But we don't have k12's value. Alternatively, maybe it relates to k8?\n\nWait, k8 is 224, and sqrt(k8)=~14.97, which is close to 15. Let me see 15 squared is 225, so k8=225-1=224. Ah! That's another pattern. So k8=15\u00b2 -1. Because 15\u00b2=225, so 225-1=224. So that's another square-based formula. The user didn't note that, but that's a good observation.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- k6 = k3\u00b2 (7\u00b2=49)\n\n- k8 = 15\u00b2 -1 (225-1=224)\n\n- k11 = 34\u00b2 -1 (1156-1=1155)\n\n- k13 = 76\u00b2 -11 (5776-11=5765)\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be that some keys are squares of integers minus a small constant (either 0, -1, or -11). So for k14, following this, let's see:\n\nk14=10544. Let me see if it's of the form (n)^2 - c. Let me see the square closest below and above 10544.\n\nsqrt(10544) \u2248102.68, so the squares around are 102\u00b2=10404 and 103\u00b2=10609.\n\nCompute the difference:\n\n10544 - 102\u00b2 = 10544 -10404 = 140\n\n103\u00b2 - 10544 = 10609 -10544 =65\n\nSo, it's 140 more than 102\u00b2, or 65 less than 103\u00b2. Since the previous patterns subtract a small number (like -1, -1, -11), subtracting 65 might be too big, but maybe there's a relation with another key?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 102.68 relates to another key? Let's see, k7=76, k11=34\u00b2-1, so 34 is double of 17, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if 10544 can be expressed in terms of another key squared. For example, k8 is 224, so (k8)^2 is 224\u00b2=50176, which is way too big. k11 is 1155, so (k11)^2 is way too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k14 relates to k3=7? 7* something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's part of a sequence where each key is a square minus something. Let me see.\n\nIf the pattern is that each key is a square of an integer minus some constant, then for k14:\n\nLooking at the previous keys, the constants were 0 (for k6=7\u00b2), -1 (for k8, k11), and -11 (for k13). Maybe the constants follow a pattern? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the constants are increasing by 10? 0, -1, -11... Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the constants are related to previous keys. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if 10544 can be written as (k something squared minus something). Let me see:\n\nLooking at k7=76, which is part of k13. Maybe 102.68 is close to k7* something?\n\nWait, 76*1.35 \u2248 102.6. Hmm, 76*1.35 is 102.6, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the 65 difference from 103\u00b2 could be linked to another key. For instance, k5=21, 21*3=63, close to 65. Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps k14 = (k something)^2 - 65. But since the problem states \"square-based formulas\", maybe there's a more direct relation.\n\nWait, let me check the problem's \"INVESTIGATE\" section:\n\n- \"Why is \u221ak13 \u2248 k7? Because k13 = k7\u00b2 - 11!\"\n\n- \"Is \u221ak14 \u2248 some_key? 102.68...\"\n\n- \"If k15 = k8\u00b2 - C, what C makes sense? And then find patterns for k16.\"\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"If k15 = k8\u00b2 - C, what C makes sense?\" So the user is suggesting that perhaps k15 is derived from k8 squared minus some constant.\n\nGiven that k8 is 224, so k8 squared is 224\u00b2 = 50176. So if k15 = 50176 - C, then C would be 50176 -k15. But we don't know k15 yet.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Find square patterns for k14, k15, k16\". So perhaps the user is expecting us to follow the existing patterns, such as the keys being squares minus a small constant, and maybe the constants follow a pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys follow a sequence where each term is a square minus a number that increases by 10? Let's see:\n\nk6 = 7\u00b2 -0 (constant 0)\n\nk8 =15\u00b2 -1 (constant -1)\n\nk11=34\u00b2 -1 (same constant -1)\n\nk13=76\u00b2 -11 (constant -11)\n\nHmm, the constants jump from -1 to -11, which is a big jump. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the constants are related to previous keys? For example, k13's constant is -11, which is 10 more than -1. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers being squared are increasing by a certain amount:\n\nk3=7, then k6=7\u00b2.\n\nThen next squared number is 15 (for k8=15\u00b2-1), then 34 (for k11=34\u00b2-1), then 76 (for k13=76\u00b2 -11). Let me see the differences between those numbers:\n\nFrom 7 to 15: +8\n\n15 to 34: +19\n\n34 to 76: +42\n\nHmm, 8, 19, 42. Not obvious pattern. Alternatively, 8 is 8, 19 is 8+11, 42 is 19+23, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each squared number is previous squared number plus something?\n\nWait, 7, 15, 34, 76. Let me see:\n\nFrom 7 to 15: 15 = 7*2 +1\n\nFrom 15 to 34: 34=15*2 +4\n\nFrom 34 to76: 76=34*2 +28?\n\nHmm, not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the squared numbers could be following a Fibonacci-like sequence or something else, but maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers 7,15,34,76 are doubling roughly:\n\n7*2=14 (close to 15)\n\n15*2=30 (close to 34)\n\n34*2=68 (close to 76). So approximately doubling each time, adding 1,4,8? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, these numbers are part of another sequence.\n\nAlternatively, let me think differently. Maybe the keys correspond to different squared numbers minus constants, and the constants are linked to the previous keys.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the constants are the key numbers themselves? For example, k13=76\u00b2 -11, where 11 is a constant, but 11 is not directly a previous key.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the constants are related to the previous constants? From 0 (for k6) to -1 (k8 and k11) then to -11 (k13). Maybe the constants are multiplied by 10 and added 0? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the constants are following the sequence of prime numbers? 0 is not prime, -1 isn't either. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the constants are the number of letters in the key's name? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the problem again. The user says \"Find square patterns for k14, k15, k16\". So perhaps following the existing patterns:\n\nLooking at the existing keys:\n\nk6 = 7\u00b2 (so square of key3)\n\nk8 = 15\u00b2 -1\n\nk11=34\u00b2 -1\n\nk13=76\u00b2 -11\n\nSo maybe the pattern is every 5th key? 6,8,11,13, so not exactly. Alternatively, the next key after 13 would be 14, which is the current target.\n\nLooking at the squared numbers: 7,15,34,76. Let me see if there is a pattern in their progression:\n\n7 to 15: +8\n\n15 to 34: +19\n\n34 to76: +42\n\nLooking at the differences between these differences:\n\n19-8=11\n\n42-19=23\n\nHmm, 11,23... which are both primes, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the differences between the squared numbers are increasing by approximately doubling?\n\n8,19 (which is 8*2 +3), 42 (19*2 +4). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if 7,15,34,76 correspond to some known sequence. Let me compute:\n\n7,15,34,76. Let me see:\n\n7*2 +1=15,\n\n15*2 +4=34,\n\n34*2 +8=76,\n\nSo each time multiplying by 2 and adding an incrementing power of 2?\n\n1 (2^0), 4 (2^2), 8 (2^3). Hmm, not exactly. The additions are +1, +4, +8. The multipliers are 1,4,8 which are 2^0, 2^2, 2^3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the added numbers are doubling each time:\n\n1, then 4 (double of 2?), then 8 (double of 4). So 1, 4,8, which is doubling but starting at 1.\n\nIf that's the case, the next term would be 76*2 +16= 152+16=168. So the next squared number would be 168, and then k16 would be 168\u00b2 minus something?\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Alternatively, if the next squared number after 76 is 168, then k15 or k16 could be 168\u00b2 minus a constant.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let me try to approach k14 first.\n\nGiven k14=10544. Let me see if it can be expressed as a square minus a constant.\n\nLooking at sqrt(10544)=~102.68. Closest squares are 102\u00b2=10404 and 103\u00b2=10609.\n\nCompute 10544-102\u00b2=10544-10404=140\n\n103\u00b2-10544=65\n\nSo, 10544 = 103\u00b2 -65 or 102\u00b2+140.\n\nSince the previous patterns use subtraction, maybe 103\u00b2-65. If so, is 65 a relevant number here?\n\nLooking at previous constants:\n\nk6: 0\n\nk8: -1\n\nk11: -1\n\nk13: -11\n\nk14: -65?\n\nHmm, that might be possible. The constants are 0, -1, -1, -11, -65. It seems like they are increasing by multiplying by 11? 0 to -1 (difference -1), then -1 to -1 (no change), then -1 to -11 (difference -10), then -11 to -65 (difference -54). Not a clear pattern, but maybe each time multiplied by some factor?\n\nAlternatively, the constants could be related to the differences between the squared numbers:\n\nBetween 7 and 15: difference 8, constant 0?\n\nBetween 15 and 34: difference 19, constant -1?\n\nBetween 34 and76: difference 42, constant -11?\n\nBetween 76 and next number (if following the progression): ?\n\nHmm, perhaps the constants are following the Fibonacci sequence? 0, -1, -1, -11... Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the constants are the previous constant plus some function of the squared number difference?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the constants are related to the squared numbers divided by something. For example, 7\u00b2=49, constant 0. 15\u00b2=225, constant -1 (so 225-224=1). 34\u00b2=1156, constant -1 (1156-1=1155). 76\u00b2=5776, constant -11 (5776-5765=11). Hmm, the constants are 0, -1, -1, -11. The 11 is 11 times the previous constant? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the constants are the key numbers divided by something? For example, key6=49, constant 0; key8=224, constant -1; key11=1155, constant -1; key13=5765, constant -11. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the constants are the number of the key minus something. For example, key6: 6-6=0. key8:8-9=-1. key11:11-12=-1. key13:13-24=-11. Hmm, 6-6=0, 8-9=-1, 11-12=-1, 13-24=-11. The subtracted numbers are 6,9,12,24. These numbers: 6,9,12,24. The differences are +3, +3, +12. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the constants are related to the previous constant multiplied by some factor plus an increment.\n\nFrom 0 to -1: 0 * something + (-1)\n\nFrom -1 to -1: -1 * something +0\n\nFrom -1 to -11: -1 *11 +0?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the constants are the previous constant multiplied by 11 and subtracted by something? 0*11 -11= -11? Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, this might be overcomplicating. Maybe the pattern for the squared numbers is adding +8, +19, +42, then next difference?\n\nLooking at the differences between the squared numbers:\n\n7 to 15: +8\n\n15 to34: +19 (difference between differences: +11)\n\n34 to76: +42 (difference between differences: +23)\n\nThe differences between the differences are +11 and +23, which are primes again. The next difference might be +47 (next prime after 23?), making the next squared number difference 42+47=89, so next squared number is 76+89=165. Then k16 would be 165\u00b2 minus something.\n\nAlternatively, the differences between squared numbers are increasing by roughly doubling the previous difference's increment. 8 to 19 is +11, then 19 to42 is +23, which is roughly double of 11 plus 1. Then next would be +47 (double of 23 plus 1). So 42+47=89, so next squared number is 76+89=165. Then the constant could be following the constants' pattern: 0, -1, -1, -11, let's see next constant.\n\nThe constants so far are 0 (for 7\u00b2), -1 (for15\u00b2), -1 (for34\u00b2), -11 (for76\u00b2). Maybe the constants are multiplying by 11 each time? 0, -1, -1*11=-11? Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, the constants for the squared numbers:\n\nFor 7\u00b2:0, so 7\u00b2 +0\n\nFor 15\u00b2: -1, so 15\u00b2 -1\n\nFor34\u00b2: -1, so 34\u00b2 -1\n\nFor76\u00b2: -11, so76\u00b2-11\n\nPerhaps the constants are related to the squared numbers divided by 100 or something? Let me see:\n\n15\u00b2 -1 =225-1=224 (k8)\n\n34\u00b2 -1=1156-1=1155 (k11)\n\n76\u00b2 -11=5776-11=5765 (k13)\n\nHmm, maybe the constants are the last two digits of the squared number divided by something?\n\nFor 15\u00b2=225: last two digits 25, subtract 1 gives 24? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the constants could be the digit sum? 225: digit sum 9, but constant is -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the constants are the previous key number divided by something.\n\nLooking at k6=49 (which is 7\u00b2+0). The next key is k8=224=15\u00b2-1. The difference between key numbers is 8-6=2, but the value increased by 175. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the keys are every 5 steps? 6,8,11,13, so not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are at positions where the index corresponds to the squared numbers:\n\nWait, key3 is 7, key6 is 49 (7\u00b2), key8 is 15\u00b2-1, key11 is 34\u00b2-1, key13 is76\u00b2-11. So the squared numbers are at keys 3,6,8,11,13... Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, the squared numbers (7,15,34,76) could be following a pattern where each is previous*2 plus something:\n\n7*2 +1=15,\n\n15*2 +4=34,\n\n34*2 +8=76,\n\nSo the added numbers are 1,4,8, which are 2^0, 2^2, 2^3.\n\nIf this pattern continues:\n\nNext would be 76*2 +16=152+16=168,\n\nThen the next squared number is 168,\n\nSo the next key (k16?) would be 168\u00b2 minus some constant.\n\nFollowing the constants pattern: The constants so far are 0 (for7\u00b2), -1 (15\u00b2), -1 (34\u00b2), -11 (76\u00b2). Maybe the next constant is following a pattern: 0, -1, -1, -11, let's see:\n\nThe constants between the squared numbers:\n\nBetween 7 and15: constant went from0 to-1 (difference -1)\n\nBetween15 and34: constant stayed at -1 (difference0)\n\nBetween34 and76: constant went from-1 to-11 (difference-10)\n\nIf the differences between constants are -1,0,-10, then next difference might be something like... Not sure. Maybe the differences of constants are -1, +0, -10, then next could be... Maybe it's multiplying by 10? -1, 0 (which is +1), then -10 (difference of -11). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the constants could be related to the added numbers in the squared number progression. The added numbers were 1,4,8,16 (if following 2^n). The constants for each squared number are 0, -1, -1, -11. Maybe the constants are related to the added number divided by something? 1/1, 4/4=1, 8/8=1, 16/ (something)=11? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the constants are the added number subtracted by previous constant? Let's see:\n\nFirst constant 0.\n\nSecond constant: added number 1 - previous constant 0? 1-0=1, but it's -1. Not.\n\nAlternatively, added number minus something else.\n\nAlternatively, this might be too convoluted. Let's try to see if there is a simpler pattern.\n\nLooking at the keys:\n\nk6=49 (7\u00b2),\n\nk8=224 (15\u00b2 -1),\n\nk11=1155 (34\u00b2 -1),\n\nk13=5765 (76\u00b2 -11),\n\nk14=?\n\nIf we see the pattern for the squared numbers: 7,15,34,76,...\n\nEach time, the next number is roughly double the previous plus some increment:\n\n7 to15: double (14) plus1,\n\n15 to34: double (30) plus4,\n\n34 to76: double (68) plus8,\n\nSo the added increments are 1,4,8, which are doubling each time (2^0, 2^2, 2^3). Maybe next would be 16?\n\nSo next squared number after76 would be 76*2 +16= 152+16=168.\n\nThus, the next squared number is 168, so the next key (assuming k16?) would be 168\u00b2 minus some constant.\n\nNow, what's the pattern for the constants?\n\nThe constants are 0, -1, -1, -11,...\n\nLooking at the constants:\n\nFor the first squared number (7\u00b2): 0,\n\nFor the second (15\u00b2): -1,\n\nThird (34\u00b2): -1,\n\nFourth (76\u00b2): -11,\n\nIf we consider the constants are related to the increment added in the squared number progression:\n\nThe increments were 1,4,8,16,...\n\nThe constants for squared numbers after the first are -1, -1, -11.\n\nWait, the first increment (1) corresponds to the second squared number (15\u00b2) having constant -1.\n\nThe second increment (4) corresponds to the third squared number (34\u00b2) having constant -1.\n\nThe third increment (8) corresponds to the fourth squared number (76\u00b2) having constant -11.\n\nHmm, maybe the constants are the increment divided by something?\n\n1 divided by 1 is 1 but constant is -1,\n\n4 divided by 4 is 1, but constant is -1,\n\n8 divided by (something) gives -11? Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the constants are the sum of previous constants?\n\nFirst: 0,\n\nSecond: -1,\n\nThird: -1 (previous +0?),\n\nFourth: -11 (previous + -10?).\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe constants are following a pattern related to the squared numbers:\n\nFor 7\u00b2, constant 0,\n\nFor 15\u00b2: 15/15=1, so -1,\n\nFor 34\u00b2: 34/34=1, so -1,\n\nFor76\u00b2: 76/ (something)=11? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the constants are the previous squared number's increment divided by something:\n\nThe increment between 7 and15 is8, but the constant was -1.\n\nBetween15 and34:19, but constant -1,\n\nBetween34 and76:42, constant -11.\n\nHmm, 42 divided by 3.818 is 11? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, this is getting too complicated. Maybe the pattern is that every other key subtracts 1, then at the fourth step subtracts 11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the constants are related to the position of the squared number in the sequence:\n\nFirst squared number (7\u00b2) is position1: 0,\n\nSecond (15\u00b2): position2: -1,\n\nThird (34\u00b2): position3: -1,\n\nFourth (76\u00b2): position4: -11,\n\nFifth (168\u00b2): position5: ?\n\nIf so, the constants are 0, -1, -1, -11,...\n\nPerhaps the pattern for constants is 0, then -1 repeats, then subtracts 10? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the constants for the nth squared number are:\n\nFor n=1:0,\n\nn=2:-1,\n\nn=3:-1,\n\nn=4:-11,\n\nn=5: ?\n\nMaybe the constants start at 0, then subtract 1 for next two terms, then subtract 10 more?\n\nAlternatively, let's see the constants progression: 0, -1, -1, -11,...\n\nThe difference from the first to second is -1,\n\nSecond to third:0,\n\nThird to fourth:-10,\n\nSo the differences between constants are -1,0,-10.\n\nIf we see that the differences are multiplied by 10 each time? -1, 0 (which is not exactly), -10.\n\nAlternatively, the differences are -1, then 0 (which is +1 from previous difference), then -10 (difference of -11 from previous difference). Not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the constants are related to the squared numbers' digits?\n\n7\u00b2=49: digits sum to13, but constant is0.\n\n15\u00b2=225: digits sum to9, constant is-1.\n\n34\u00b2=1156: digits sum to13, constant is-1.\n\n76\u00b2=5776: digits sum to25, constant is-11.\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the constants are the previous constant multiplied by -1 and subtract something.\n\nFrom 0 to -1: 0*-1 -1= -1,\n\nFrom -1 to -1: -1*-1 -2= -1,\n\nFrom -1 to -11: -1*-1 -12= -11,\n\nThen next would be -11*-1 -? Let's see the subtracted numbers:1,2,12,...\n\nNot clear.\n\nAlternatively, this might not be the right approach. Let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the keys given:\n\nk6=49,\n\nk8=224,\n\nk11=1155,\n\nk13=5765,\n\nk14=?\n\nIf we look at the values:\n\n49 is 7\u00b2,\n\n224 is 15\u00b2 -1,\n\n1155 is34\u00b2 -1,\n\n5765 is76\u00b2 -11.\n\nLooking at the squared terms:\n\n7,15,34,76,...\n\nEach term is previous*2 plus something:\n\n7*2 +1=15,\n\n15*2 +4=34,\n\n34*2 +8=76,\n\nSo the added numbers are 1,4,8,... which are 2^0, 2^2, 2^3,...\n\nNext would be 76*2 +16=168,\n\nThen the next term after76 is168,\n\nSo the next squared number is168,\n\nSo the next key (k16?) would be168\u00b2 minus some constant.\n\nNow, what's the pattern for the subtracted constants?\n\nThe constants subtracted are:\n\nFor7\u00b2:0,\n\n15\u00b2:1,\n\n34\u00b2:1,\n\n76\u00b2:11,\n\nSo the subtracted constants are 0,1,1,11,...\n\nHmm, the subtracted constants could be following a pattern where every second term adds 10?\n\nFrom 0 to1: +1,\n\n1 to1:0,\n\n1 to11:+10,\n\nSo maybe next is +10 again? 11+10=21?\n\nThus, subtracted constant for168\u00b2 would be21,\n\nSo the value would be168\u00b2 -21,\n\nBut not sure if that's the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the subtracted constants could be the sum of previous constants:\n\n0+1=1,\n\n1+1=2,\n\n1+11=12,\n\nBut not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the subtracted constants are 0,1,1,11. Let's see:\n\nFrom 0 to1: difference +1,\n\nFrom1 to1: difference0,\n\nFrom1 to11: difference+10,\n\nIf following the differences of the subtracted constants: +1,0,+10,\n\nThe differences of these differences are -1, +10,\n\nSo next difference could be + something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the subtracted constants are related to the added numbers in the squared number progression:\n\nThe added numbers were1,4,8,16,...\n\nFor the first subtracted constant (after 0), it's1,\n\nThen next is1 (maybe 4/4),\n\nThen next is11 (8 +3?), Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the subtracted constants could be the added numbers divided by something:\n\nFirst added number1, subtracted constant1,\n\nSecond added number4, subtracted constant1 (4/4=1),\n\nThird added number8, subtracted constant11 (8+3=11),\n\nFourth added number16, subtracted constant maybe 16+ something,\n\nHmm, this might not be consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the subtracted constants are following a different pattern:\n\n0,1,1,11,...\n\n0,1,1,11, 111,... like adding zeros? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the subtracted constants are the digits of some number?\n\n0,1,1,11, maybe 111 next?\n\nBut 111 is too big.\n\nAlternatively, the subtracted constants are 0,1,1,11 which are like 0, then 1 repeated twice, then 1 followed by 1 (11). Maybe the next is 111?\n\nBut that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the constants as the previous subtracted constant multiplied by 11:\n\n0 *11=0,\n\n1 *11=11,\n\nBut the third is1, not11.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, this might be a different pattern. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the keys and their positions:\n\nKey6:7\u00b2=49,\n\nKey8:15\u00b2 -1=224,\n\nKey11:34\u00b2 -1=1155,\n\nKey13:76\u00b2 -11=5765,\n\nThe positions of the keys (6,8,11,13) might also have a pattern. The differences between key positions are2,3,2.\n\nFrom6 to8:+2,\n\n8 to11:+3,\n\n11 to13:+2,\n\nSo next might be +3 to get to16,\n\nThen key16 would be the next term.\n\nIf following the squared number progression, the next squared number is168,\n\nThen subtract some constant. Let's see what the subtracted constant could be.\n\nLooking at the subtracted constants for each squared number:\n\nFor7\u00b2 (key6): subtracted 0,\n\nFor15\u00b2 (key8): subtracted1,\n\nFor34\u00b2 (key11): subtracted1,\n\nFor76\u00b2 (key13): subtracted11,\n\nSo, the subtracted constants are0,1,1,11.\n\nThe pattern here could be that every second term after the first is adding 10?\n\nThe first subtracted constant is0,\n\nThen next is1,\n\nthen1 again,\n\nthen1+10=11,\n\nthen next would be11+10=21?\n\nThus, for the next squared number168, subtracted constant would be21,\n\nSo the value would be168\u00b2 -21.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n168\u00b2=28224,\n\n28224-21=28203.\n\nBut maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the subtracted constants and the added numbers in the squared progression:\n\nThe added numbers are1,4,8,16 (powers of 2 multiplied by1, etc.)\n\nThe subtracted constants are0,1,1,11.\n\nNotice that 1 is 1,\n\n1 is also 1,\n\n11 is 1+10,\n\nMaybe the subtracted constants are the added number divided by something plus something else.\n\nFor the first subtracted constant (after 7\u00b2):\n\nAdded number for the next term is1 (from7*2 +1=15),\n\nSubtracted constant is1? Wait, no, for15\u00b2 it's subtracted1,\n\nWait the subtracted constant for15\u00b2 is1,\n\nWhich is exactly the added number (1).\n\nSimilarly, the next added number is4 (from15*2 +4=34),\n\nSubtracted constant for34\u00b2 is1, which is 4/4=1.\n\nThen next added number8 (from34*2+8=76),\n\nSubtracted constant for76\u00b2 is11, which is 8 +3=11,\n\nHmm, maybe adding 3?\n\nAlternatively, 8*1.375=11,\n\nAlternatively, this is not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the subtracted constants are the sum of previous subtracted constants plus something.\n\nStarting from0,\n\nThen next is0 +1=1,\n\nThen1 +0=1,\n\nThen1 +10=11,\n\nThen11 + ...?\n\nIf following 0,1,1,11, the differences between terms are +1,0,+10.\n\nPerhaps the next difference is +100, making the next subtracted constant11+100=111,\n\nBut that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, noticing that the subtracted constants are0,1,1,11,\n\nThese numbers resemble 0,1,1, 11, which could be the digits 0, then 1, then 1, then 1 and1, suggesting the next might be 111, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the subtracted constants are the number of letters in the word representations?\n\n0 is \"zero\" (4 letters), but that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern isn't obvious, so maybe the key is to see that the added numbers are doubling each time (1, 2,4,8,16) but the subtracted constants are 0,1,1,11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the subtracted constants are following the sequence of 0, then 1 repeating twice, then 1 followed by 1 (11), so next is 1 followed by 11 (111).\n\nIf so, then for the next term (key16), subtracted constant would be111,\n\nThus the value would be168\u00b2 -111=28224-111=28113.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the subtracted constants are related to the position of the squared number in the sequence:\n\nFirst squared number (7) at position1: subtract0,\n\nSecond (15) at position2: subtract1,\n\nThird (34) at position3: subtract1,\n\nFourth (76) at position4: subtract11,\n\nFifth (168) at position5: subtract 111? (following 0,1,1,11,111)\n\nThen the value would be168\u00b2 -111=28224-111=28113.\n\nAlternatively, the subtracted constants are following the pattern 0,1,1,11, so adding a zero each time? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the subtracted constant for each squared number is the previous subtracted constant multiplied by 10 plus1:\n\nStarting with0,\n\n0*10+1=1,\n\n1*10+1=11,\n\n11*10+1=111,\n\nBut the third term should be1, but that would give11, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the given data:\n\nThe keys are at positions6,8,11,13, so next would be16,\n\nThe corresponding squared numbers are7,15,34,76, so next is168,\n\nThe subtracted constants are0,1,1,11,...\n\nMaybe the subtracted constants are following the pattern that every even index after the first is1, and odd indices after the second are adding 10?\n\nAlternatively, since the subtracted constants are0,1,1,11, maybe the next is1 (repeating every even position?), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the subtracted constant is the previous subtracted constant plus the previous added number divided by something.\n\nFor example,\n\nAfter 7\u00b2 (0 subtracted),\n\nNext subtracted is1 which is previous subtracted (0) +1 (the added number for the next term?),\n\nThen next subtracted is1 which is previous subtracted (1) +0,\n\nThen next is11 which is previous (1) +10,\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the subtracted constants are the sum of the digits of the squared number minus something.\n\nFor15\u00b2=225:2+2+5=9; 9-8=1,\n\n34\u00b2=1156:1+1+5+6=13; 13-12=1,\n\n76\u00b2=5776:5+7+7+6=25;25-14=11,\n\nHmm, so subtracted constant is digit sum minus something:\n\nFor225: 9-8=1,\n\n1156:13-12=1,\n\n5776:25-14=11,\n\nMaybe the subtracted number is digit sum minus (something like previous subtracted * something).\n\nAlternatively, 8 is previous subtracted (1) *8,\n\n12 is previous (1) *12,\n\n14 is previous (11)*1.27,\n\nNot obvious.\n\nAlternatively, the subtracted constants could be the digit sum minus twice the number of digits:\n\nFor225:9 -2*3=3\u22601,\n\nNo,\n\nAlternatively digit sum divided by something.\n\nAlternatively, this approach might not be the right path.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nLooking at the keys and their values:\n\nKey6:49,\n\nKey8:224,\n\nKey11:1155,\n\nKey13:5765,\n\nWe can see:\n\n49 is7\u00b2,\n\n224 is15\u00d714.933\u2026 but also 16\u00d714,\n\nWait 16\u00d714=224,\n\n34\u00d734=1156,\n\nWait, but 34\u00b2 is 1156, but the value given is1155 which is one less.\n\nSimilarly, 15\u00d714.933 is not exact.\n\nAlternatively, 224=15\u00d714 +14,\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the values are (n)(n+1) where n is something:\n\nFor49:7\u00d77,\n\n224=15\u00d714.933,\n\nNot exactly,\n\nAlternatively, 224=16\u00d714,\n\n1155=33\u00d735,\n\nWait 33\u00d735=1155,\n\n5765=76\u00d776 -11,\n\nWait 76\u00d776=5776, so 5776-11=5765,\n\nHmm, so the pattern is:\n\nKey6:7\u00d77,\n\nKey8:16\u00d714,\n\nWait that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the keys correspond to the terms of a sequence where each term is previous term multiplied by something plus something.\n\nLooking at the keys' positions and the values:\n\nPosition6:49,\n\nPosition8:224,\n\nPosition11:1155,\n\nPosition13:5765,\n\nThe positions are increasing by2,3,2,\n\nThe values are increasing by factors of ~4.57, ~5.15, ~5.\n\nThe multipliers are roughly around4-5,\n\nBut not exact.\n\nAlternatively, the values can be expressed as:\n\n49=7\u00b2,\n\n224=15\u00d714 + 14,\n\n1155=33\u00d735,\n\n5765=76\u00d776 -11,\n\nNot obvious.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the differences between the values:\n\n224-49=175,\n\n1155-224=931,\n\n5765-1155=4610,\n\nThese differences:175,931,4610,\n\nNot a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the values could be related to triangular numbers or something else.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be expecting us to notice that the keys correspond to the following:\n\nEach key number (6,8,11,13) has a value which is (n)(n+1) or similar,\n\nBut 6\u00d77=42\u226049,\n\n8\u00d79=72\u2260224,\n\nNo,\n\nAlternatively, the values are (n)^2 minus something:\n\nFor6:49=8\u00b2 - 15,\n\n8:224=15\u00b2 - 1,\n\n11:1155=34\u00b2 -1,\n\n13:5765=76\u00b2 -11,\n\nWait, that's the case.\n\nIndeed:\n\n7\u00b2 =49,\n\n15\u00b2=225, 225-1=224,\n\n34\u00b2=1156, 1156-1=1155,\n\n76\u00b2=5776, 5776-11=5765,\n\nSo the pattern is that for key number k,\n\nThe value is (previous number)^2 minus a certain increment.\n\nLooking at the keys and their corresponding numbers:\n\nKey6 corresponds to7,\n\nKey8 corresponds to15,\n\nKey11 corresponds to34,\n\nKey13 corresponds to76,\n\nThese numbers (7,15,34,76) seem to be following a pattern:\n\n7 to15: +8,\n\n15 to34:+19,\n\n34 to76:+42,\n\nThe differences between these are8,19,42,\n\nWhich themselves increase by11 and23,\n\nHmm, 19-8=11,\n\n42-19=23,\n\nThe next difference might be 23 + 12=35?

Wait no, the added terms were doubling each step:\n\nThe first addition after7 was1,\n\nThen next addition was4 (double of2? Or double of previous addition? 1\u00d72\u00b2=4,\n\nThen next addition was8 (4\u00d72),\n\nNext addition16 (8\u00d72),\n\nSo the additions are1, 4, 8,16, which are 2^0, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the additions are 2^(n-1) where n is the term count,\n\nFirst addition (after7) is term1:2^(1)=2?
