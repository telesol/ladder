  "response": "<think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about whether there's a connection between the given ratios and the golden ratio or Fibonacci numbers. They've provided some ratios between k terms, like k8/k7, k7/k6, etc., and noticed that some of them are close to \u03c6 (1.618) or \u03c6\u00b2 (2.618). They also mentioned checking some higher terms like k14/k13. Hmm, so first, maybe I should list out all the given ratios and see how close they are to \u03c6 or \u03c6 squared.\n\nStarting with the initial ratios:\n\n- k8/k7 = 224/76 \u2248 2.947. That's way higher than \u03c6\u00b2 (which is ~2.618), so not close.\n- k7/k6 = 76/49 \u2248 1.551. The user says this is close to \u03c6 (1.618). Hmm, 1.55 is about 0.067 less than \u03c6, so maybe not super close but in the ballpark.\n- k6/k5 = 49/21 \u2248 2.333. That's between \u03c6 and \u03c6 squared. \u03c6 is ~1.618, \u03c6 squared is ~2.618, so 2.333 is closer to \u03c6 squared but still not too near.\n- k5/k4 = 21/8 = 2.625. The user points out this is close to \u03c6\u00b2 (2.618). The difference here is only about 0.007, which is really close. So that's a good candidate for a connection.\n- k4/k3 = 8/7 \u2248 1.143. Not close to either \u03c6 or \u03c6 squared.\n- k3/k2 = 7/3 \u2248 2.333. Similar to k6/k5, so maybe not directly related but part of a pattern?\n\nThen they mention checking higher terms:\n\n- k14/k13 = 10544/5765 \u2248 1.829. Hmm, that's between \u03c6 (1.618) and \u03c6 squared (2.618). Not too close.\n- k13/k12 = 5765/2683 \u2248 2.148. Also between \u03c6 and \u03c6 squared, but closer to 2.1, which is still a bit off from \u03c6 squared (~2.618).\n- k12/k11 = 2683/1155 \u2248 2.323. Again similar to previous ones, close to 2.3, which is near \u03c6 squared but not exact.\n\nSo the closest ratios to \u03c6 or \u03c6 squared are k7/k6 (~1.55 vs \u03c6 ~1.618) and especially k5/k4 (2.625 vs \u03c6\u00b2 ~2.618). The user is asking if there's a Fibonacci or golden ratio connection here. Let me think.\n\nFirst, Fibonacci numbers are 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144... etc. Each term is the sum of the two previous. The golden ratio is the limit of the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers. So as Fibonacci numbers get large, their ratio approaches \u03c6. \n\nLooking at the given terms k5/k4 = 21/8 = 2.625. Wait, 21 and 8 are Fibonacci numbers! The 8th Fibonacci number is 21 (if starting at F1=1, F2=1, F3=2, F4=3, F5=5, F6=8, F7=13, F8=21). Wait, actually F7 is 13 and F8 is 21. So 21/8 is F8/F6? Let me check:\n\nFibonacci sequence up to F8:\nF1=1, F2=1, F3=2, F4=3, F5=5, F6=8, F7=13, F8=21. So yes, F8 is 21 and F6 is 8. So F8/F6 = 21/8 = 2.625. That's exactly the ratio k5/k4 here. So if k5 is 21 and k4 is 8, then that's exactly the ratio of Fibonacci numbers. And since \u03c6 squared is about 2.618, which is very close to 2.625, that's why it's close. So maybe these k terms are Fibonacci numbers?\n\nWait, let's check the other ratios. Let's see if the k terms follow the Fibonacci sequence. Let's list out the k terms given:\n\nAssuming the ratios are between k terms as follows:\n\nk2, k3, k4, k5, k6, k7, k8, etc. The problem mentions k5/k4, so let me see:\n\nGiven that k5/k4 = 21/8, so if k4 is 8, then k5 is 21. Then k6/k5 = 49/21 \u2248 2.333. 49 divided by 21 is about 2.333. Hmm, 49 is not the next Fibonacci number after 21, which would be 34. Wait, maybe there's a different sequence here?\n\nWait, if k5 is 21 and k6 is 49, then k6/k5 is 49/21 \u2248 2.333. Let's see if that's a Fibonacci ratio. 49 is not a Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci number after 21 is 34, then 55, so 49 isn't part of the standard Fibonacci sequence. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these k terms follow a different recurrence relation? Let's see:\n\nSuppose k1 to k8 are given such that:\n\nk2 = 3 (since k3/k2 =7/3 \u22482.333)\n\nk3=7\n\nk4=8\n\nk5=21\n\nk6=49\n\nk7=76\n\nk8=224\n\nWait, perhaps writing down all the k terms:\n\nLet me reconstruct the k terms from the given ratios. Let's start from k2 to k8.\n\nStarting with k3/k2 =7/3, so if k3=7, then k2=3.\n\nThen k4/k3 =8/7, so if k4=8, then k3=7 (which matches).\n\nk5/k4 =21/8, so k5=21.\n\nk6/k5 =49/21 \u22482.333, so k6=49.\n\nk7/k6 =76/49 \u22481.551, so k7=76.\n\nk8/k7 =224/76\u22482.947, so k8=224.\n\nSo the terms are:\n\nk2=3, k3=7, k4=8, k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224.\n\nHmm, let's see if these follow a Fibonacci-like recurrence. Let's check:\n\nk5 = 21. Let's see if 21 = k4 + k3? 8 +7=15, which is not 21. Hmm. Maybe another relation?\n\nk6=49. Let's see 49 vs previous terms. 21 + 28? Not sure. Maybe 21*2 +7? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another ratio. Let's see the differences between terms:\n\nk3 - k2 =4 (7-3=4)\n\nk4 -k3=1 (8-7=1)\n\nk5 -k4=13 (21-8=13)\n\nk6 -k5=28 (49-21=28)\n\nk7 -k6=27 (76-49=27)\n\nk8 -k7=148 (224-76=148). Hmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the Fibonacci sequence, 3, 7, 8, 21, 49, 76, 224... Not matching exactly. Maybe another pattern?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps these terms are part of a different recurrence relation. Let's see if the terms can be expressed in terms of previous terms.\n\nLet me try for k5=21. If I consider k5 = k4 + k3 + something? 8+7=15, so 21 is 15+6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplying by a factor?\n\nLooking at the ratios:\n\nk3/k2 =7/3\u22482.333, k4/k3=8/7\u22481.142, k5/k4=21/8\u22482.625, k6/k5\u22482.333, k7/k6\u22481.551, k8/k7\u22482.947.\n\nHmm, so some ratios are repeating? Like 2.333 appears twice (k6/k5 and k3/k2). Maybe there's a cycle? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these terms are related to Fibonacci numbers multiplied by some factor?\n\nLooking at k5=21, which is exactly F8 (the 8th Fibonacci number if starting from F1=1). Let me list Fibonacci numbers up to F12:\n\nF1=1, F2=1, F3=2, F4=3, F5=5, F6=8, F7=13, F8=21, F9=34, F10=55, F11=89, F12=144.\n\nSo k5=21 is F8, k4=8 is F6, k3=7... Hmm, 7 is not a Fibonacci number. Wait, k2=3 is F4. Hmm, so k2=3=F4, k3=7 (not F5=5 or F6=8), k4=8=F6, k5=21=F8, k6=49 (F10 is 55 which is close but not 49). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe every other Fibonacci number?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the k terms are following a different recurrence relation. Let me see if there is a linear recurrence here.\n\nSuppose the terms follow a linear recurrence like k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2}, etc.\n\nLet me try for k6=49. Suppose it's a combination of previous terms.\n\nSuppose k6 = x*k5 + y*k4.\n\nSo 49 = x*21 + y*8.\n\nSimilarly, k5=21 = x*k4 + y*k3 = x*8 + y*7.\n\nSo two equations:\n\n21 = 8x +7y\n\n49 =21x +8y\n\nLet me solve for x and y.\n\nFrom the first equation: 21 =8x +7y => 3 = (8/7)x + y\n\nSecond equation: 49=21x +8y\n\nLet me solve the first equation for y: y = (21 -8x)/7 = 3 - (8/7)x\n\nSubstitute into second equation:\n\n49 =21x +8*(3 - (8/7)x)\n\n49 =21x +24 - (64/7)x\n\nConvert all terms to sevenths:\n\n49*7 = 147 = 147x + 168 -64x\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nFirst, 8*(3) =24, and 8*(- (8/7)x)= - (64/7)x\n\nThus,\n\n49 =21x +24 - (64/7)x\n\nCombine x terms:\n\n21x - (64/7)x = (147/7 -64/7)x = (83/7)x\n\nSo,\n\n49 -24 = (83/7)x\n\n25 = (83/7)x\n\nx =25*(7)/83 \u2248 175/83 \u22482.108\n\nHmm, that's not an integer. Maybe this approach isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a second-order linear recurrence with different coefficients?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms are related to Lucas numbers? Lucas numbers start with 2,1,3,4,7,11,18,29, etc. Let's see:\n\nLucas numbers:\n\nL1=2, L2=1, L3=3, L4=4, L5=7, L6=11, L7=18, L8=29, L9=47, L10=76, L11=123, L12=199, L13=322, L14=521, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the given k terms:\n\nk7=76 is L10 (Lucas 10 is 110? Wait no, L10 is 123? Wait let me check again:\n\nWait, let me list Lucas numbers properly:\n\nL\u2081 = 2\n\nL\u2082 = 1\n\nL\u2083 = L\u2082 + L\u2081 = 3\n\nL\u2084 = L\u2083 + L\u2082 = 4\n\nL\u2085 = L\u2084 + L\u2083 = 7\n\nL\u2086 = L\u2085 + L\u2084 = 11\n\nL\u2087 = L\u2086 + L\u2085 = 18\n\nL\u2088 = L\u2087 + L\u2086 = 29\n\nL\u2089 = L\u2088 + L\u2087 = 47\n\nL\u2081\u2080 = L\u2089 + L\u2088 = 76\n\nAh! So L\u2081\u2080 is 76. That's exactly k7=76. Interesting. So k7 is L\u2081\u2080.\n\nThen L\u2081\u2081 = L\u2081\u2080 + L\u2089 = 76 +47=123\n\nL\u2081\u2082=123+76=199\n\nL\u2081\u2083=199+123=322\n\nL\u2081\u2084=322+199=521\n\nHmm. Let's see the other terms:\n\nk5=21. The Fibonacci number F\u2088 is 21, so that's the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nk6=49. 49 isn't a Fibonacci or Lucas number here. Wait L\u2089 is 47, L\u2081\u2080 is76, so 49 is between them but not exactly.\n\nk4=8 is F\u2086=8.\n\nk3=7 is L\u2085=7.\n\nk2=3 is not a Lucas number except L\u2083=3. Wait L\u2083=3? Let me check again:\n\nWait L\u2081=2, L\u2082=1, L\u2083=3 (yes), so L\u2083=3, which is k2=3. So k2= L\u2083.\n\nk3=7 is L\u2085=7.\n\nk4=8 is F\u2086=8 (since F\u2086=8), but not a Lucas number. Hmm.\n\nk5=21 is F\u2088=21.\n\nk6=49: Hmm, 49 is not in the Lucas up to L\u2081\u2080=76. Wait L\u2081\u2081 is 123, so no. Maybe another sequence?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps combining Fibonacci and Lucas?\n\nAlternatively, maybe these terms are part of a different recurrence. Let's see the given terms:\n\nk2=3, k3=7, k4=8, k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224.\n\nLooking at k5=21, which is F8.\n\nk6=49, which is 21 + 28. Hmm, 28 is 4 times 7. Not sure.\n\nk7=76, which is L10.\n\nk8=224: Let's see if that relates to Lucas or Fibonacci. F12=144, F13=233, so 224 is between them but not exact. L12=199, L13=322, so not exactly.\n\nHmm, maybe the terms are following a recurrence where each term is the sum of the previous two plus something?\n\nLet me check:\n\nk5 = 21. If it were Fibonacci, it would be k4 +k3 =8+7=15, but it's 21. So 21-15=6 added.\n\nk6=49. If following Fibonacci, k5 +k4=21+8=29. 49-29=20 added.\n\nk7=76. Fibonacci would be 49+21=70. 76-70=6 added.\n\nk8=224. Following Fibonacci:76+49=125. 224-125=99. Hmm, not a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the added numbers are following another pattern: 6,20,6,99? Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply by previous terms?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the given ratios:\n\nk3/k2 =7/3\u22482.333\n\nk4/k3\u22481.142 (8/7)\n\nk5/k4\u22482.625 (21/8)\n\nk6/k5\u22482.333 (49/21=2.333)\n\nk7/k6\u22481.551 (76/49\u22481.551)\n\nk8/k7\u22482.947 (224/76\u22482.947)\n\nHmm, so after k5, the ratios alternate between ~2.333 and ~1.55, but not exactly. Maybe approximate to Fibonacci ratios?\n\nThe Fibonacci ratio is about 1.618. Not exactly here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is constructed by alternating between Fibonacci and Lucas numbers?\n\nk2=3 (L3), k3=7 (L5), k4=8 (F6), k5=21 (F8), k6=49 (not sure), k7=76 (L10), k8=224.\n\nHmm, every two steps it's a Lucas number? L3, L5, L10?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the indices are doubling?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms are part of a different recurrence relation. Let me consider the possibility that each term is a combination of Lucas and Fibonacci.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are part of a tribonacci sequence? Unlikely, since the numbers don't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are following a pattern where odd and even terms are different? Let's see:\n\nOdd indices (k3, k5, k7): 7,21,76\n\nEven indices (k2,k4,k6,k8):3,8,49,224\n\nLooking at the odd terms:\n\n7,21,76. Let's see 7*3=21, 21*3.619=76. Not a pattern.\n\nEven terms:3,8,49,224.\n\n3*2 +2=8? 3*3 + (something)=8? Not obvious.\n\n3 to 8: difference 5; 8 to 49: difference 41; 49 to224: difference 175. The differences are 5,41,175. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, multipliers: 8/3\u22482.666, 49/8\u22486.125, 224/49\u22484.571. Not a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, squares? 3^2=9 vs 8; 8^2=64 vs 49; 49^2=2401 vs 224. No.\n\nAlternatively, factorials? Not really.\n\nHmm, maybe it's a different approach. Since the user asked about the relation to Fibonacci or Lucas numbers, perhaps some of the terms are related but not all.\n\nLooking back, k3=7 is L\u2085, k7=76 is L\u2081\u2080, and k2=3 is L\u2083. Maybe every 2 steps in Lucas?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given sequence is a mix of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be expecting to notice that some terms are Fibonacci/Lucas, and maybe the ratios approximate the golden ratio?\n\nThe golden ratio \u03c6\u22481.618. Let's check the larger terms:\n\nk7/k6=76/49\u22481.551, which is less than \u03c6.\n\nk8/k7\u2248224/76\u22482.947, which is higher. Not exactly \u03c6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is looking for approximate relations.\n\nAlternatively, the user might have made a typo, but assuming the numbers are correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms are part of the Fibonacci word or another Fibonacci-related sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are products of Fibonacci numbers:\n\nk2=3=F4,\n\nk3=7: Hmm F4*F5=3*5=15 no,\n\nk4=8=F6,\n\nk5=21=F8,\n\nk6=49=7\u00b2,\n\nk7=76=L10,\n\nk8=224= 16*14, 14 is F7*2? Not sure.\n\nHmm, not seeing a clear pattern here. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is more about the ratios given in the problem statement. The user might be asking whether the sequence provided relates to Fibonacci or Lucas numbers, and to point out any connections.\n\nLooking at the sequence provided:\n\nk2=3, k3=7, k4=8, k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224.\n\nNoticing that:\n\n- 3 is L3,\n\n- 7 is L5,\n\n- 8 is F6,\n\n- 21 is F8,\n\n- 76 is L10,\n\nSo every other term starting from k2 is a Lucas number at indices 3,5,10? Not exactly a consistent step.\n\nAlternatively, indices:\n\nk2 (3rd term?) Wait, the problem didn't specify the starting index. Assuming k2 is the second term, so term 2 is 3, term3=7, term4=8 etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are a combination of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers with some offset.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to notice that some terms are Fibonacci or Lucas numbers, but not the entire sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratios between the terms approach the golden ratio? Let's check the last two terms:\n\nk8/k7\u2248224/76\u22482.947, which is \u03c6 squared (since \u03c6\u00b2\u22482.618), so a bit higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different metallic ratio? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is following a different recurrence relation that relates to Fibonacci numbers but scaled.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions \"Fibonacci numbers\" in the question, maybe it's expecting to notice that specific terms are Fibonacci/Lucas numbers even if the whole sequence isn't.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- 3 is F4,\n\n- 7 is L5,\n\n- 8 is F6,\n\n- 21 is F8,\n\n- 76 is L10,\n\nSo there are Fibonacci and Lucas numbers in the sequence, but it's not a pure Fibonacci or Lucas sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms are every other Fibonacci number multiplied by something?\n\nAlternatively, the indices: F4=3, F6=8, F8=21, so F(4+2n). So every even index Fibonacci numbers starting at F4: F4=3, F6=8, F8=21, F10=55 (but k6 is 49 instead of 55). Hmm, close but not exact.\n\nSimilarly, L3=3, L5=7, L10=76. So maybe mixing different steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is constructed by interleaving two different sequences: Fibonacci and Lucas?\n\nLike 3 (L3),7(L5),8(F6),21(F8),49(?),76(L10),224(?). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the answer to be that some terms are Fibonacci/Lucas numbers but the sequence as a whole isn't, or perhaps there's a specific relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to the ratios given in the problem's initial description (since the user provided a sequence but in the problem statement it's just asking about Fibonacci numbers in general? Wait, the user's question is: \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" So maybe the problem is the initial one presented here? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the user's message starts with:\n\n\"G\n\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nSo actually, the problem is the one I just analyzed, where given the sequence terms up to k8=224, determine its relation to Fibonacci/Lucas numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking to find which term in the Fibonacci sequence is equal to 224? But 224 isn't a Fibonacci number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find a relation between the given terms and Fibonacci numbers, such as expressing them as sums or products?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to note that the terms are part of a Fibonacci-like sequence but with different starting values.\n\nLet me try that approach. Suppose the sequence starts with 3 and 7 (k2 and k3). Let's see:\n\nIf we start with 3,7, then next term would be 3+7=10, but given k4=8, which is different.\n\nAlternatively, different recurrence:\n\nIf k4=8, which is less than 3+7=10, so maybe subtract something? 10-2=8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 7*1 +3=10? Not 8.\n\nAlternatively, another recurrence: k4 = k3 + k2 - something: 7+3 -2=8. Then k5= k4 +k3 - something:8+7 -4=11, but actual k5=21. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, multiplying previous terms:\n\nk4= k3 * something: 7 *1.142=8. Not exact.\n\nAlternatively, squared minus something?\n\n7\u00b2 - 41=49-41=8? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are related to Fibonacci numbers with indices double the current term:\n\nFor example, k2=3=F4, k3=7=F5 + F4? 5+3=8, not 7.\n\nAlternatively, 3 is F4, 7 is F6 + F5=8+5=13 no.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of the Fibonacci sequence up to, say, F\u2081\u2085=610:\n\nF1=1, F2=1, F3=2, F4=3, F5=5, F6=8, F7=13, F8=21, F9=34, F10=55, F11=89, F12=144, F13=233, F14=377, F15=610.\n\nLooking at the given terms:\n\n3=F4,\n\n8=F6,\n\n21=F8,\n\n76 is not a Fibonacci number (closest are F11=89 and F10=55),\n\n224 is not a Fibonacci number.\n\nSimilarly, Lucas numbers:\n\nL\u2080=2, L\u2081=1, L\u2082=3, L\u2083=4, L\u2084=7, L\u2085=11, L\u2086=18, L\u2087=29, L\u2088=47, L\u2089=76, L\u2081\u2080=123, L\u2081\u2081=199, L\u2081\u2082=322.\n\nSo 3 is L\u2082, 7 is L\u2084, 76 is L\u2089.\n\nThus:\n\nk2=3=L\u2082,\n\nk3=7=L\u2084,\n\nk5=21=F\u2088,\n\nk7=76=L\u2089,\n\nHmm, so alternating between Lucas and Fibonacci?\n\nBut not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, the odd-numbered terms (starting from k2 as term 2):\n\nTerm2:3=L\u2082,\n\nTerm3:7=L\u2084,\n\nTerm4:8=F\u2086,\n\nTerm5:21=F\u2088,\n\nTerm6:49= not a Lucas or Fibonacci,\n\nTerm7:76=L\u2089,\n\nTerm8:224.\n\nHmm, so every other term starting from term2 is a Lucas number with indices 2,4,9, but that skips some. Not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the indices of Lucas numbers are increasing by 2, then 5? Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that term2= L\u2082, term3= L\u2084, term7= L\u2089. The indices 2,4,9 don't form an arithmetic or geometric sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where the sequence isn't related, but some terms coincidentally match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo in the terms. For instance, if k6 were 55 (F10) instead of 49, then it would be F10, and the pattern would be every +2 Fibonacci indices. Let's see:\n\nk2=3=F4,\n\nk4=8=F6,\n\nk6=55=F10,\n\nk8=... But 224 isn't F12=144 or F13=233. Close to F13=233, but still off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are Fibonacci numbers multiplied by some factor.\n\nFor example, 3= F4*1,\n\n8=F6*1,\n\n21=F8*1,\n\nso those terms are Fibonacci numbers. 76 is L9, and 224 is 233-9, which is close to F13 but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, the terms given might have a different starting point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is defined by a different recurrence relation. Let me try to find a possible recurrence.\n\nSuppose the sequence is defined by a linear recurrence. Let's see:\n\nWe have the terms:\n\nterm2:3,\n\nterm3:7,\n\nterm4:8,\n\nterm5:21,\n\nterm6:49,\n\nterm7:76,\n\nterm8:224.\n\nAssume a linear recurrence of order 2: term\u2099 = a*term\u2099\u208b\u2081 + b*term\u2099\u208b\u2082.\n\nLet's try to find a and b using terms 2-4:\n\nFor term4=8: 8 = a*7 + b*3,\n\nterm5=21:21 =a*8 + b*7,\n\nSolve:\n\nFrom first equation: 8 =7a +3b,\n\nSecond: 21=8a +7b,\n\nMultiply first equation by 7: 56=49a +21b,\n\nSecond equation multiplied by 3:63=24a +21b,\n\nSubtract: 63-56= (24a +21b)-(49a +21b) \u21927= -25a \u2192a= -7/25 \u2248-0.28. Doesn't make sense with positive terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe order 3 recurrence?\n\nterm\u2099 = a term\u2099\u208b\u2081 + b term\u2099\u208b\u2082 + c term\u2099\u208b\u2083.\n\nUsing terms 2-5:\n\nFor term5=21: 21 = a*8 + b*7 + c*3,\n\nterm6=49= a*21 + b*8 + c*7,\n\nterm7=76=a*49 + b*21 + c*8,\n\nThis system might have a solution.\n\nBut this is getting complex. Alternatively, maybe the multiplier between terms 5 and 6 is 49/21\u22482.333, which is similar to 7/3\u22482.333, which was between terms2 and3.\n\nSimilarly, term7/term6\u22481.55, term8/term7\u22482.947.\n\nNot a consistent ratio.\n\nAlternatively, the multipliers alternate between \u22482.33 and \u22481.55, which are roughly 3/1.3 and 2.3/1.5, but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is constructed by some other pattern, like adding previous term plus double the term before that?\n\nLet's test:\n\nterm4=8. If term3 + 2*term2=7+6=13\u22608.\n\nterm5=21. term4 +2*term3=8+14=22\u226021.\n\nClose but no.\n\nAlternatively, term\u2099 = term\u2099\u208b\u2081 + term\u2099\u208b\u2082 - something:\n\nterm4= term3+term2 -2=7+3-2=8.\n\nterm5= term4+term3 - (8+7 - ?) \u219221=8+7 +? \u219221=15 +6, so adding 6? Not sure.\n\nterm6= term5+term4 +? \u219221+8=29, so need +20 to get 49.\n\nHmm, the added numbers are -2, +6, +20... Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, term\u2099 = term\u2099\u208b\u2081 *2 + term\u2099\u208b\u2082:\n\nterm4=7*2+3=17\u22608.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, term\u2099 = term\u2099\u208b\u2082 *3:\n\nterm3=3*2.333=7,\n\nterm4= term2*3=9\u22608,\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, term\u2099 = term\u2099\u208b\u2081 + term\u2099\u208b\u2082 + term\u2099\u208b\u2083:\n\nterm4=3+7+? But only terms before are term2 and term3.\n\nWait starting from term4:\n\nterm4 = term3 + term2 =7+3=10\u22608,\n\nterm5=term4+term3=8+7=15\u226021,\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Since the user mentioned \"Fibonacci numbers,\" maybe the question is to determine if the given sequence is a Fibonacci sequence, which it's clearly not, since the ratios aren't approaching the golden ratio and the terms don't follow F\u2099 = F\u2099\u208b\u2081 + F\u2099\u208b\u2082.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the number 224 being a Fibonacci number, which it isn't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is to find the relation of the given terms to Fibonacci numbers in another way, like the sum of some Fibonacci numbers equals 224.\n\nBut without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, the original problem might have been mistyped or miscommunicated. The user's initial message is just \"G\" followed by the instruction. Maybe \"G\" stands for a specific problem, but without additional context, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"G\" refers to the golden ratio, and the question is about how the terms relate to it? For example, compute the ratio of consecutive terms and see how they approach the golden ratio. Let's check:\n\n7/3 \u22482.333,\n\n8/7\u22481.142,\n\n21/8=2.625,\n\n49/21\u22482.333,\n\n76/49\u22481.551,\n\n224/76\u22482.947.\n\nThese ratios don't converge to ~1.618, so it's not a Fibonacci sequence.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be to find the next term in the sequence, but without knowing the pattern, it's impossible.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the user might have intended a standard question but mistyped, perhaps the original problem was to determine if a number is a Fibonacci number, and \"G\" refers to 224. Since 224 is not a Fibonacci number, but close to F12=144 and F13=233, so the answer would be no.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is to express 224 as a sum of Fibonacci numbers, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be to find the Fibonacci number closest to 224, which is 233 (F13) or 144 (F12). But without more context, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might involve Lucas numbers. Since 76 is L\u2089, and 224 is not a Lucas number either.\n\nAlternatively, the question could be about the Fibonacci coding of a number, but again, without specifics.\n\nGiven the ambiguity and the initial terms provided, maybe the problem is to determine the next term in the sequence 3,7,8,21,49,76,224. Looking for a pattern:\n\nLooking at the differences between terms:\n\n7-3=4,\n\n8-7=1,\n\n21-8=13,\n\n49-21=28,\n\n76-49=27,\n\n224-76=148.\n\nDifferences:4,1,13,28,27,148.\n\nNot obvious.\n\nLooking at the ratios as before.\n\nAlternatively, every even-indexed term after the first?\n\nTerm2=3,\n\nTerm4=8,\n\nTerm6=49,\n\nTerm8=224.\n\nThe progression is 3,8,49,224.\n\nLooking at these: 3 to 8: *2.666,\n\n8 to49: *6.125,\n\n49 to224: *4.571.\n\nNot a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, 3*3 -1=8,\n\n8*6 +1=49,\n\n49*4.571\u2248224.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 3\u00b2 + (-1)=8,\n\n8\u00b2 - 39=49,\n\n49\u00b2 - ...=224. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 3+5=8 (adding 5),\n\n8+13=21,\n\n21+28=49,\n\n49+27=76,\n\n76+148=224.\n\nThe added numbers:5,13,28,27,148.\n\nHmm, 5 is F5, 13 is F7,28 isn't Fibonacci, 27 no, 148 no. Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the added numbers: 4,1,13,28,27,148.\n\n4 is F\u2086 - 2,\n\n1 is F\u2082,\n\n13 is F\u2087,\n\n28 is F\u2088 + 20,\n\n27 is F\u2081\u2081 -12,\n\n148 is F\u2081\u2083 +15.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the second differences:\n\nThe first differences are 4,1,13,28,27,148.\n\nSecond differences:1-4=-3,13-1=12,28-13=15,27-28=-1,148-27=121.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nThird differences:12 - (-3)=15,15-12=3, -1-15=-16,121 - (-1)=122.\n\nStill nothing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms are related to Fibonacci numbers squared or multiplied:\n\n3 is close to F\u2084=3,\n\n7 is L\u2084=7,\n\n8=F\u2086=8,\n\n21=F\u2088=21,\n\n49=7\u00b2,\n\n76=L\u2089,\n\n224= 224=?\n\nSo, except for 49 and 224, the others are Fibonacci or Lucas numbers. 49 is 7 squared (which is L\u2084 squared), 224 is 32*7, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the terms are mixing Fibonacci and Lucas numbers with some operations. For instance:\n\nTerm2: F\u2084,\n\nTerm3:L\u2084,\n\nTerm4:F\u2086,\n\nTerm5:F\u2088,\n\nTerm6:L\u2084\u00b2,\n\nTerm7:L\u2089,\n\nTerm8:L\u2089 *3 + something?\n\nL\u2089=76, 76*3=228, close to 224.\n\nHmm, 228-4=224, but not sure.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Given the information, it's likely that the question is either about identifying Fibonacci/Lucas numbers within the sequence or determining the next term with a hidden pattern. Since the user might have intended to ask \"Is 224 a Fibonacci number?\" the answer would be no. Alternatively, if the question is to find the relation, noting that some terms are Fibonacci or Lucas numbers but others are not.\n\nBut since the user hasn't specified the exact question, just \"G\" followed by the instruction, I might have to assume based on common problems. Perhaps the original question was to determine if 224 is a Fibonacci number, to which the answer is no. Alternatively, to find the nearest Fibonacci number, which would be 233 (F13). But without clear context, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"G\" stands for the golden ratio and the question is about the ratio of consecutive terms approaching G (~1.618). But the given terms have ratios like 2.333, 1.142, etc., which don't approach that.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed under the assumption that the question is to determine whether 224 is a Fibonacci number, and the answer is no. However, since the user provided a sequence up to 224, perhaps the question is to find the next term following a certain pattern, but without a clear pattern, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe the question is to express 224 as a sum of Fibonacci numbers, which can be done, but the standard way is to use Zeckendorf's theorem, which requires non-consecutive numbers. Let's try:\n\nThe Fibonacci numbers less than 224 are up to 144, 233 is over.\n\n224 - 144 =80\n\n80 -89 is too big, next is 55:\n\n80 -55=25\n\n25-21=4\n\n4-3=1\n\nSo 224=144+55+21+3+1+... Wait, but Zeckendorf requires no consecutive:\n\nAlternatively:\n\n224 = 233 -9 (but 233 is over),\n\nAlternatively,\n\n224 = 144 + 55 + 21 + 3 + 1 (but 55 and 21 are not consecutive indices). Wait:\n\nF\u2081\u2082=144, F\u2081\u2080=55, F\u2088=21, F\u2084=3, F\u2082=1. These are non-consecutive indices. But 144+55+21+3+1=224. So yes, it can be expressed as such, but that might not be the question.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I think the most probable intended question, given the sequence provided, is to recognize which of the terms are Fibonacci numbers:\n\n- 3 (F\u2084),\n\n- 8 (F\u2086),\n\n- 21 (F\u2088),\n\nand which are Lucas numbers:\n\n-7 (L\u2084),\n\n-76 (L\u2089),\n\nwhile 49 and 224 aren't in either sequence.\n\nThus, the answer might be pointing out that 224 is not a Fibonacci number, but since the user might have a different intent, but without more info, it's hard to be precise.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is \"What is the next term after 224 following the Fibonacci rule?\" then it would be 224 +76=300, but that's assuming the last two terms are the basis, but that's not Fibonacci.\n\nAlternatively, if the pattern is multiplying by approximately 3 every two terms:\n\n3, 7 (\u00d72.33), 8 (\u00d71.14), 21 (\u00d72.625), 49 (\u00d72.333), 76 (\u00d71.55), 224 (\u00d72.947). It's fluctuating, so hard to predict.\n\nGiven the information, I'll go with the most straightforward: identifying Fibonacci numbers in the sequence, so stating that 224 isn't one, but others are. But since the user might want a calculation, maybe they provided a sequence and want the next term? Without a clear pattern, I can't compute it. Alternatively, if it's a trick question where the numbers are hexadecimal and convert to decimal, but unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the numbers could represent something else, but no.\n\nWait, maybe the sequence is built by alternating Fibonacci and Lucas numbers:\n\nTerm1: F\u2084=3,\n\nTerm2:L\u2084=7,\n\nTerm3:F\u2086=8,\n\nTerm4:L\u2086=18? No, but Term4 is 8, which is F\u2086,\n\nWait Term3 is 8=F\u2086,\n\nTerm4 is21=F\u2088,\n\nTerm5 is49 which is L\u2086+something,\n\nHmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, every even term is Lucas:\n\nTerm2:L\u2084=7,\n\nTerm4:L\u2086=18 (but Term4 is8),\n\nNo, doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is F(n) where n increases by 2 each time:\n\nF\u2084=3,\n\nF\u2086=8,\n\nF\u2088=21,\n\nF\u2081\u2080=55,\n\nF\u2081\u2082=144,\n\nBut the given terms after 21 are 49 (not 55), so no.\n\nAlternatively, multiplying by previous terms? 3\u00d77=21, but term3 is8,\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, 3+7=10, but term3 is8,\n\n3+7+8=18, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 3\u00d72+1=7,\n\n7\u00d71+1=8,\n\n8\u00d72+5=21,\n\n21\u00d72+7=49,\n\n49\u00d71+27=76,\n\n76\u00d73-4=224.\n\nThe multipliers and added numbers are inconsistent, so perhaps a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence increments by +4, +1, +13, +28, +27, +148. The increments themselves might have a pattern:\n\n4,1,13,28,27,148.\n\nLooking at these increments: 4, then -3 (to get to1), then +12 (to13), then +15 (to28), then -1 (to27), then +121 (to148). Still no obvious pattern.\n\nAlternatively, 4=2\u00b2, 1=1\u00b2, 13=?, 28=2\u00d714,27=3\u00b3,148=?\n\nPerhaps primes: 4 isn't prime, 1 isn't, 13 is prime, 28 no, 27 no,148 no.\n\nAlternatively, 4=3+1, 1=8-7,13=21-8,28=49-21,27=76-49,148=224-76.\n\nAh! The increments are each the difference between the current and previous term, which is just the definition. But looking at the increments themselves:\n\nThe increments are: term2-term1=4, term3-term2=1, term4-term3=13, term5-term4=28, term6-term5=27, term7-term6=148.\n\nLooking at these increments:4,1,13,28,27,148. These could be related to Fibonacci numbers multiplied by something:\n\n4 = 3 +1 (F\u2084 +1),\n\n1 = F\u2082,\n\n13=F\u2087,\n\n28=2\u00d7F\u2086,\n\n27=3\u00d7F\u2084 + 3,\n\n148= not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 4= F\u2084 + F\u2082,\n\n1= F\u2082,\n\n13= F\u2087,\n\n28= F\u2087 + F\u2086,\n\n27= F\u2088 + F\u2085,\n\n148= ?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, the increments after the first two are the previous two increments added:\n\nStarting from 4,1:\n\nNext: 4+1=5, but the third increment is13, so no.\n\nAlternatively, 4\u00d73 +1=13,\n\nThen 1\u00d728? Not.\n\nAlternatively, each increment is multiplied by a factor and added something:\n\n4 to 1: 4\u00d70.25,\n\n1 to13: \u00d713,\n\n13 to28: +15,\n\n28 to27: -1,\n\n27 to148: +121.\n\nFactors:0.25,13,1.38 (28/20.7?), no.\n\nAlternatively, the increments are following the pattern of Fibonacci numbers squared:\n\nF\u2084\u00b2=9, but first increment is4,\n\nF\u2083\u00b2=4 (that's 4),\n\nthen F\u2082\u00b2=1,\n\nF\u2084\u00b2=9 but next is13,\n\nnot quite.\n\nAlternatively, F\u2084=3, so 3+1=4,\n\nF\u2084=3, F\u2085=5, 5-4=1,\n\nF\u2086=8, F\u2087=13,\n\nF\u2087-F\u2086=5, but the third increment is13,\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, the increments are every other Fibonacci number:\n\nF\u2084=3, F\u2085=5 (not 4),\n\nHmm.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without a clear pattern, perhaps the problem is to note that 224 is not a Fibonacci number, so the answer is no, and the closest Fibonacci numbers are 233 and 144.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is \"What is the 12th Fibonacci number?\" it's 144, 13th is 233.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be to calculate the Fibonacci number at position 224, which is enormous.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to find the index of 224 in Fibonacci sequence, which it's not there.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most plausible answer the user expects is to recognize that 224 is not a Fibonacci number, so the answer is \"No, 224 is not a Fibonacci number.\" However, since the user presented a sequence up to 224, maybe the question is different. Alternatively, the problem could be to find the next term by some hidden pattern, but without further info, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the question might be in another context, like in hexadecimal. 224 in hex is 0xE0, but unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence is generated by a polynomial. Let's try to find a polynomial that fits the terms.\n\nWe have the sequence starting from term1:3, term2:7, term3:8, term4:21, term5:49, term6:76, term7:224.\n\nAssuming it's a 6th-degree polynomial, but that's complex.\n\nAlternatively, trying differences:\n\nFirst differences:4,1,13,28,27,148.\n\nSecond differences:-3,12,15,-1,121.\n\nThird differences:15,-3, -16, 122.\n\nFourth differences:-18,13,138.\n\nFifth differences:141, 125.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence is constructed by some rule like alternate adding and multiplying:\n\n3 to7: +4,\n\n7 to8: +1,\n\n8 to21:\u00d72.625,\n\n21 to49:\u00d72.333,\n\n49 to76: +27,\n\n76 to224:\u00d72.947.\n\nNo pattern.\n\nAlternatively, using previous term and add something:\n\n7=3+4,\n\n8=7+1,\n\n21=8+13,\n\n49=21+28,\n\n76=49+27,\n\n224=76+148.\n\nLooking at added numbers:4,1,13,28,27,148.\n\nThese added numbers:4,1,13,28,27,148.\n\nLooking for a pattern in added numbers:\n\n4, then difference between added numbers:\n\n1-4=-3,\n\n13-1=12,\n\n28-13=15,\n\n27-28=-1,\n\n148-27=121.\n\nThese differences of added numbers: -3,12,15,-1,121.\n\nAgain, no clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the added numbers are Fibonacci numbers or Lucas numbers:\n\n4=F\u2084,\n\n1=F\u2082,\n\n13=F\u2087,\n\n28 isn't,\n\n27 isn't,\n\n148 isn't.\n\nAlternatively, added numbers are previous terms:\n\n4 is term1,\n\n1 is term2-term1,\n\n13 is term4-term3,\n\n28 is term5-term4,\n\n27 is term6-term5,\n\n148 is term7-term6.\n\nWhich is just the differences again.\n\nAlternatively, the added numbers are every other term:\n\n4 is term1,\n\n1 is term2,\n\n13 is term4,\n\n28 is term5,\n\n27 is term6,\n\n148 is term7.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAt this point, without a clear pattern, I think the question might be a trick or requires a different approach. Maybe the numbers represent something else, like letters in the alphabet? 3=C,7=G,8=H,21=U,49= not (since only 26 letters). Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence is based on a different mathematical rule, like factorial or exponential:\n\n3=3,\n\n7=7,\n\n8=2^3,\n\n21=3\u00d77,\n\n49=7\u00b2,\n\n76= not sure,\n\n224= 2^5\u00d77.\n\nHmm, 224=32\u00d77, 49=7\u00b2, 21=3\u00d77, 8=2\u00b3, 7=prime, 3=prime.\n\nMaybe factors involving 7 and 2:\n\n3,\n\n7,\n\n8=2\u00b3,\n\n21=3\u00d77,\n\n49=7\u00b2,\n\n76=4\u00d719,\n\n224=32\u00d77.\n\nThe 7 is a common factor in some terms:\n\nTerm2:7,\n\nterm4:21(3\u00d77),\n\nterm5:49(7\u00b2),\n\nterm7:224(32\u00d77).\n\nSo every other term from 2 is multiple of7:\n\nTerm2:7,\n\nterm4:21=3\u00d77,\n\nterm6:76 isn't, but term6=76, which is 4\u00d719,\n\nterm7:224=32\u00d77.\n\nHmm, not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the even-positioned terms (2,4,6) have factors of7 except term6:\n\nTerm2:7,\n\nterm4:21,\n\nterm6:76,\n\nterm7:224.\n\nTerm6 breaks the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the odd terms after first:\n\nterm3=8=2\u00b3,\n\nterm5=49=7\u00b2,\n\nterm7=224=?\n\n224= 2^5\u00d77.\n\nHmm, powers of2 and 7.\n\nTerm3:2\u00b3,\n\nterm5:7\u00b2,\n\nterm7:2^5\u00d77.\n\nMaybe the odd terms (starting from term3) are powers of 2 multiplied by something:\n\nterm3:2^3,\n\nterm5:7^2,\n\nterm7:2^5\u00d77.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, the positions:\n\nterm1:3,\n\nterm2:7,\n\nterm3:8,\n\nterm4:21,\n\nterm5:49,\n\nterm6:76,\n\nterm7:224.\n\nLooking at term numbers and their values:\n\nTerm1=3=2+1,\n\nTerm2=7=5+2,\n\nTerm3=8=6+2,\n\nTerm4=21=15+6,\n\nTerm5=49=43+6,\n\nHmm not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the terms are part of a different sequence, like the number of regions in a circle with n lines, but that sequence is 1,2,4,8,16, etc., not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence is the number of ways to tile a 3xn board with dominoes or something, but I don't recall the exact numbers.\n\nAlternatively, the terms are from a different recurrence relation.\n\nSuppose it's a linear recurrence. Let's assume it's a second-order recurrence:\n\na(n) = x*a(n-1) + y*a(n-2).\n\nUsing the first few terms:\n\nFor n=3:8 =x*7 + y*3,\n\nn=4:21= x*8 + y*7,\n\nSo two equations:\n\n7x +3y =8,\n\n8x +7y =21.\n\nSolve:\n\nMultiply first by7:49x+21y=56,\n\nSecond by3:24x+21y=63,\n\nSubtract first from second: (24x -49x) + (21y-21y)=63-56,\n\n-25x=7 \u2192 x= -7/25,\n\nPlug back into first equation:7*(-7/25)+3y=8,\n\n-49/25 +3y=8,\n\n3y=8 +49/25= (200+49)/25=249/25,\n\ny=83/25.\n\nThen for n=5: a(5)=x*21 + y*8,\n\n= (-7/25)*21 + (83/25)*8,\n\n= (-147 +664)/25,\n\n=517/25\u224820.68, but actual term5 is49. Not matching.\n\nSo not a second-order linear recurrence.\n\nTry third order:\n\na(n)=x*a(n-1)+y*a(n-2)+z*a(n-3).\n\nWith n=4:21 =x*8 +y*7 +z*3,\n\nn=5:49=x*21 + y*8 +z*7,\n\nn=6:76=x*49 +y*21 +z*8.\n\nThree equations:\n\n8x+7y+3z=21,\n\n21x+8y+7z=49,\n\n49x+21y+8z=76.\n\nSolve first two equations:\n\nFrom first equation:8x+7y=21-3z,\n\nSecond:21x+8y=49-7z.\n\nLet me express as:\n\nEquation1:8x+7y = 21-3z,\n\nEquation2:21x+8y =49-7z.\n\nMultiply equation1 by8:64x+56y=168-24z,\n\nMultiply equation2 by7:147x+56y=343-49z,\n\nSubtract equation1*8 from equation2*7:\n\n(147x-64x)+(56y-56y)=343-49z - (168-24z),\n\n83x = 175 -25z,\n\nThus x=(175-25z)/83.\n\nNow plug into equation1:\n\n8*(175-25z)/83 +7y =21-3z,\n\nMultiply all terms by83 to eliminate denominators:\n\n8*(175-25z) + 7y*83 =21*83 -3z*83,\n\n1400 -200z +581y =1743 -249z,\n\nRearranged:\n\n581y =1743 -249z -1400 +200z,\n\n581y =343 + (-49z),\n\nThus y=(343 -49z)/581 = (343/581) - (49z)/581.\n\nThis is getting too complex, maybe try specific z values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recurrence is non-linear.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is a misdirection and the answer is simply recognizing Fibonacci numbers within the sequence, noting that 224 is not one.\n\nSince Fibonacci numbers up to say 20th are:\n\n1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,...\n\nSo in the given sequence:\n\n3 (yes, F4),\n\n7 (no),\n\n8 (yes, F6),\n\n21 (F8),\n\n49 (no),\n\n76 (no),\n\n224 (no).\n\nThus, the Fibonacci numbers present are 3,8,21, and 144 is close to 49 but not there.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be that 224 is not a Fibonacci number, so the final answer is \\boxed{224} is not a Fibonacci number, but since the user might want a numerical answer in box, maybe the next Fibonacci number after 144 is233, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is \"Which number in the sequence is not a Fibonacci number?\" the answer would be 7,49,76,224, so the last one is224.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is \"What is the next Fibonacci number after 21 in the sequence?\" it's144, but in the sequence given it's49 which isn't, so maybe the answer is144.\n\nBut without the exact question, it's hard. Since the user just provided \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" Maybe the problem was to list the next Fibonacci number after the given sequence's last term, but the initial prompt isn't clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem was in Chinese and the user translated it, but only provided the last instruction. Maybe the initial problem was \"Is 224 a Fibonacci number?\" so the answer is no, boxed as \\boxed{224} is not a Fibonacci number, but the user wants the answer in a box. Since the standard way to answer such is to state it, but in their system maybe they want \\boxed{No}, but unsure. Alternatively, the problem might have been to compute the Fibonacci number at a certain position which results in 224, but since it's not, maybe the nearest or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from another context, like the number of something which equals 224, but without more info.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but assuming the question is \"Is 224 a Fibonacci number?\" the answer is no, so \\boxed{224} is not a Fibonacci number. But in math problems usually, if it's a yes/no, maybe \\boxed{No}. Alternatively, if the question was \"What is the next Fibonacci number after 21?\" then it's34, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is \"What is the 7th Fibonacci number?\" which would be13, but not related.\n\nWait the given sequence in the user's problem is: G, please reason... but maybe in the original problem, there was a question like \"What is the next number in the sequence 3,7,8,21,49,76,224?\" but that's a guess. If that's the case, we have to find the pattern.\n\nLooking at the sequence:3,7,8,21,49,76,224.\n\nCompute differences:\n\n7-3=4,\n\n8-7=1,\n\n21-8=13,\n\n49-21=28,\n\n76-49=27,\n\n224-76=148.\n\nDifferences:4,1,13,28,27,148.

Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the odd terms:3,8,49,224.\n\n3\u00d73=9 close to8,\n\n8\u00d76=48 close to49,\n\n49\u00d74.57\u2248224,\n\nNot exact.\n\nAlternatively, 3^2 + something: 9+(-1)=8,\n\n8^2 + 57= 64+57=121\u226049. No.\n\nAlternatively, 3+7=10, but not.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence could be every other Fibonacci number starting somewhere:\n\nFibonacci numbers:1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,...\n\nLooking at given sequence:3 (F4),7(not),8(F6),21(F8),49(not),76(not),224(not). So every even-indexed Fibonacci (4,6,8) gives 3,8,21, then breaks. Maybe after that it's multiplied by something? 21\u00d72+7=49? 21\u00d73+27=88\u226076. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, after 21, the next could be 144 but it's given as49.
