  "response": "<think>User query: \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\" with explanation of some observed formulas, then hypothesis regarding index appearing in formula and check list items like:\n\n- Observed:\n   - k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no) so not sure.\n   - k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n  \nHypothesis: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCheck:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? -> 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? -> 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? -> 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n\nThen question: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nUser wants to calculate f(n), presumably the function f(n) such that k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). But what are keys? The observed keys seem to be k2, k3, etc.\n\nMaybe we need more context. We have k2, k3, ... k12. Possibly a sequence: k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12 appear. Wait, the text says \"OBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\". So maybe k5 equals product of previous keys: k2 and k3.\nBut then k12 is defined as \"k8\u00d712 - 5\". The check shows that for indices 7,8,9,11,12 there's a pattern with f(n) times n plus something. Observing:\n\nWe have:\n- For index 7: k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? gives 76/7 = approx 10.857...\n- For index 8: k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? gives 224/8=28 exactly, so maybe f(8)=? equals what is it? Wait, check says \"k8 = 224/8 = 28\". So k8 = 28 * 8, and then remainder? But text \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" with f(n) times n plus g(n). For index 8, we got value: 224 / 8 = 28, so maybe f(8)=28 if the term g(n)=0. But then check says k11 = 1155/11=105 exactly, i.e., f(11)=105.\n- For index 12: given that \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ?\" gives 2683/12=223.58... but they show \"but k8\u00d712-5=2683\", so if we assume a formula of the form k_n = (f(n)*n) + g(n), and f(n) and g(n) are computed from given keys? They want to compute f(n) for each key.\n\nMaybe f(n) is something like: For n that divides k_n evenly, f(n)=k_n/n. So then:\n- For index 8, f(8)=224/8=28.\n- For index 11, f(11)=1155/11=105.\n- For index ??? We have k2? Actually check says \"observed: k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" but then they mention indices (2,3) \u2192 product equals 5\u00d7? no. But that's ambiguous.\n\nMaybe there is a pattern where the keys are being multiplied and then added with something like the index times f(n).\n\nWe need to re-read question carefully:\n\nUser query text:\n```\nINDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n\nIs there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)?\n\nCalculate f(n) for each key.\n```\n\nI see: The idea is that maybe the keys follow some function of index. Perhaps \"f(n)\" is something like k_n divided by n when it divides evenly? But then in case 1, 7 does not divide 76 evenly so not sure.\n\nLet's list the keys from check:\n- For key 7 (index=7), value = 76.\n- For key 8 (index=8), value = 224.\n- For key 9 (index=9), value = 467.\n- For key 11 (index=11), value = 1155.\n- For key 12 (index=12), value = 2683.\nWe also see that k5 is given as product of k2 and k3, but we don't have explicit values for them? Possibly the keys are known: maybe it's a sequence from some puzzle? I'll try to see if there's any pattern.\n\nMaybe f(n) = k_n / n when possible. For index 8, f(8)=224/8=28; for index 11, f(11)=1155/11=105.\nWhat about other indices:\n- For index 7: 76/7 is not an integer. But maybe it's rounded? Possibly there is a function that gives something like \"f(n)\" in some cases equals the quotient of k_n by n if divisible.\n\nMaybe we can try to derive f(n) = (k_n - g(n)) / n. And maybe g(n) might be 0 for indices with integer division.\n\nWe have check items: for index=8, 224/8 = 28 exactly; for index=11, 1155/11 =105 exactly; for index=12, they mention that k12 does not divide evenly, but the alternative formula \"k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" equals 2683. That suggests that f(12) might be computed as (k8\u00d712 -5)/12 = (28\u00d712 - 5)/12 = (336-5)/12 =331/12 which is not integer. But wait, k8 * 12= 28*12 = 336, minus 5 equals 331, then divided by 12 gives 27.5833... which is what the check says.\n\nFor index 7: 76/7 \u2248 10.857; for index 9: 467/9 \u2248 51.889.\nMaybe we try to see if there's a pattern with these numbers? 28 and 105 are perfect integers while others are decimals. Possibly f(n) is an integer only for indices that are prime or composite in some pattern? Index 7 is prime, but gives fraction; index 8 (composite) gives integer; index 11 (prime) gives integer.\n\nMaybe f(n)=? It might be related to some recurrence like: k_n = previous key * n \u00b1 constant. For example, k12= k8\u00d712 -5 indicates that when we have a composite number 12, maybe the pattern is \"previous key times current index minus something\".\n\nWe also saw k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. But then check says (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no) so perhaps not exactly.\n\nI might try to see if there's a known sequence: Possibly keys are given by a recurrence relation like k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), where f and g are functions of n determined by previous indices. The check items: k8 equals 28*8, k11 equals 105*11.\n\nMaybe we can try to guess pattern:\n- For index 2, maybe k2 is something like 4? Possibly because then product k2 \u00d7 k3 gives k5. And if k3 were say 6, then k5=24? But then they said \"product 5\u00d7? no\" so that's not it.\n\nI have to see: There are indices: 2,3,5,7,8,9,11,12.\nMaybe the sequence is defined for prime indices sometimes by multiplication, and composite ones sometimes by a linear combination of previous keys? The given formulas:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. That means if index=5 (which is composite? Actually 5 is prime) then key equals product of keys with indices 2 and 3.\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 -5. So for index 12, the formula uses index itself in multiplication.\n\nMaybe pattern: For some n, k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), where f(n) might be computed as quotient when possible? They ask \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" It seems we only have values for certain indices (7,8,9,11,12).\n\nWe can compute approximate f(7)=76/7 \u2248 10.857, but not an integer.\nf(8)=224/8 =28 exactly.\nf(9)=467/9 \u2248 51.888...\nf(11)=1155/11=105 exactly.\nf(12)=2683/12 \u2248223.58333... But they also mention \"k8\u00d712-5\" which gives f(12) = (k8\u00d712-5)/12, where k8 is 224? That equals (336 -5)/12 =331/12=27.5833, but that doesn't match the earlier division by 12. Wait check: they say \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". So if we interpret formula as k_n = (previous key multiplied by index) minus something, then for n=12: previous key is k8, and the expression becomes k8*12 - 5 gives 2683. That would be expressed in form f(12)*12 + g(12). Compare that to computed quotient if we assume f(12)=? We have k8 =28, so k8\u00d712=336, then subtract 5 gives 331, but the division of 2683 by 12 yields 223.5833, not matching.\n\nLet's re-read check point 5: \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". That means they want to express k12 in the form f(12)*12 + g(12). They observed that if we set f(12)=k8 which is 28, then what's the remainder? If we write 28*12 =336, and then plus something equals 2683, then that something would be 2683-336=2347. But then g(12) would be 2347, but they mention \"k8\u00d712 -5\" equals 2683. That suggests maybe f(12)=? Actually wait: They might be saying: if we assume k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then for n=12, one candidate is f(12) = k8 (which is 28) and then plus what constant gives 2683? Let's check: 28*12 =336. To get 2683 from 336, we need to add 2347. That doesn't match \"k8\u00d712 -5\". Wait maybe the hypothesis \"f(n)= k_n / n\" is only valid when it divides evenly.\n\nLet me re-read the question carefully:\n\nIt says: \n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\nIs there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)?\nCalculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nMaybe the idea is: when you express k_n in that form, sometimes the coefficient f(n) equals some previous key value (like k8 appears as f(12)). For instance:\n- For index 8, we get f(8)=224/8=28.\n- For index 11, we get f(11)=1155/11=105.\n- For index 12, we have an alternative formula: f(12) = k8? No.\n\nWait check: \"k8\u00d712 - 5\" equals 2683. That implies that if we try to match the form f(n)*n + g(n), maybe for n=12, they are setting f(12)=k8 and then g(12)= ? such that f(12)*n + g(12)= k8*12 - 5. Then f(12) = k8, but k8 is not necessarily equal to the quotient when dividing k12 by 12 because 2683/12 \u2248223.583, which is not 28.\n\nSo it appears that in some cases, the formula might be mixing indices and previous keys. Perhaps the pattern is: sometimes you use multiplication with index n and sometimes addition of a constant offset that involves previous key values.\n\nMaybe we are supposed to derive something like:\n\nFor k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then what is f(n)? It seems they want to know, given each key's value, if the division by its index gives an integer, then that quotient is f(n). So for n=8: f(8)=224/8=28; for n=11: f(11)=1155/11=105.\n\nFor others, maybe we can express them in a similar way? For k7, 76 divided by 7 gives non-integer. But perhaps if we try to match with another previous key value, like maybe f(7) = k2 or something? But k2 is not given explicitly; however, earlier it said \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\", so maybe k2 and k3 are factors of k5.\n\nI suspect the keys come from a sequence puzzle known as the \"Key Sequence\" problem. There's an old puzzle sometimes called \"Find the missing key\" where you multiply digits with indices, etc. Alternatively, it might be related to a multiplication pattern in the periodic table? But not sure.\n\nLet me check: k8=224, and 224 factors as 7*32 or something? Actually, 224/7=32, but that doesn't match index 8 though.\nk11=1155. 1155 factors interestingly: 1155 = 3 * 385, nope.\n\nMaybe the pattern is: for some indices n, k_n / n is an integer; sometimes it's not. And when it's not, maybe we can approximate f(n) as rounding or something?\n\nThe question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" suggests that for each index n, if we try to express k_n in the form f(n)*n + g(n), then what is f(n)? So essentially, f(n)= floor(k_n/n)? But then:\nFor n=7: 76/7 \u2248 10.857 so maybe f(7)=11? For n=9: 467/9 \u224851.888 so f(9)=52 maybe?\nBut then for n=12: if we consider the given alternative expression \"k8\u00d712-5\", that would suggest something different, because k8 is 224, and 224*12 =2688, minus 5 equals 2683, which fits. So maybe in one case, f(12) is taken as k8 instead of k12/12? But then what's the pattern?\n\nMaybe the idea is that sometimes the formula for a key uses the index multiplied by another key (from an earlier prime number index?) and sometimes it's just a linear function with slope equal to the result of dividing by n.\n\nI notice that 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 are the indices we have. The ones where f(n) is integer are for n=8 and n=11. For these, f(8)=28, f(11)=105.\nFor n=5 earlier, they said k5 = k2 * k3. So maybe in that case, f(5) would be something like ? But 5*? Not sure.\n\nWe have:\nn: k_n\n2: unknown (but appears as factor in k5)\n3: unknown (factor in k5)\n5: equals product of k2 and k3.\n7: 76\n8: 224\n9: 467\n11:1155\n12:2683\n\nMaybe we can guess k2, k3 from k5 if k5 = k2 * k3. But we don't know k5's value either.\n\nWait maybe the sequence of keys is known as \"prime key\" or something like that? Possibly it's related to a specific puzzle where you have keys numbered and you need to find a combination for a safe. There's a famous puzzle: \"Find the key from the following clues\" etc. I recall puzzles involving numbers 7, 8, 9, 11, 12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is not arithmetic but based on prime factors? For example:\nk8=224 = 28*8.\nk11=1155 = 105*11.\nSo then f(8)=28 and f(11)=105. They might be numbers that are related to something like \"prime keys\" or maybe they come from a multiplication table of primes.\n\nWhat if we try dividing k7 by 7: 76/7 \u2248 10.857, which is not an integer. But maybe it's close to 11? Similarly, k9/9=467/9 \u224851.888, which is close to 52. And k12/12 =2683/12 \u2248223.583, which is near 224? Actually, wait: 224*12 would be 2688; so if we subtract 5, that gives 2683 exactly. So maybe for n=12, f(12) should have been 224, but then plus g(n)= -5. Let's test with n=7 and n=9: If we try to find an integer multiple of n close to k_n:\nFor n=7, if f(7)=11, then 11*7=77, which is near 76; the difference is -1.\nFor n=9, if f(9)=52, then 52*9=468, which is near 467; the difference is -1.\nFor n=12, if we try f(12)=224 (like k8), then 224*12=2688, and subtracting 5 gives 2683. So pattern: f(n) might be one more than what you get by dividing k_n by n, except for the ones that divide evenly. Let's check:\nFor n=8: 28 exactly.\nFor n=11: 105 exactly.\nFor n=7: if we did (76+1)/7 =77/7=11, so f(7)=11 works.\nFor n=9: (467+1)/9 =468/9=52, so f(9)=52 works.\nFor n=12: (2683+?)/12; but they gave a formula using k8. But maybe if we try f(12) = 224, then 224*12 =2688 which is 5 more than 2683, so that would correspond to subtracting 5.\n\nSo it appears the pattern might be: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), where for some indices n, g(n) is such that if you add a small constant to k_n (maybe +1 for n=7 and n=9) then it becomes divisible by n. For n=8 and n=11, no adjustment is needed because they divide evenly.\n\nSo then maybe f(7)=11, f(8)=28, f(9)=52, f(11)=105, and then what about 12? Possibly f(12) = ? If we try to guess pattern: For 7, difference g(7) = k7 - 11*7 =76-77=-1.\nFor 9, difference g(9) =467 - 52*9 =467-468=-1.\nSo maybe for n=12, if f(12)=? then g(12) should be -5. But we already have one expression: k8\u00d712 -5 = (224)*12 -5 =2688-5=2683. So that gives a candidate: f(12)=k8 which is 224, and g(12)=-5.\n\nBut then what about n=7 and 9? They don't use previous keys explicitly, they just round the quotient to the nearest integer.\nSo maybe the answer expected: \nFor key 7, f(7) = 11 (since 76/7 \u224810.857 which rounds up to 11).\nFor key 8, f(8)=28 exactly because 224/8=28.\nFor key 9, f(9)=52 because 467/9\u224851.89, so 52 is the nearest integer multiplier.\nFor key 11, f(11)=105 because 1155/11=105 exactly.\nFor key 12, we can express it as k8\u00d712 -5, which implies a candidate f(12) = k8 = 224, but then that doesn't match if we divide: 2683/12 is not 224. \nWait, check: If we try to set f(12)=? maybe we want the multiplier to be consistent with others: For n=7 and 9, it seemed like f(n) was approximately (k_n +1)/n.\nFor n=7: (76+1)/7 =77/7=11.\nFor n=9: (467+1)/9=468/9=52.\nThen for n=12, if we try (2683+?) maybe (2683+?)/12 should be an integer. What constant would work? To get an integer, 2683 mod 12 = 2683 - 12*223 = 2683 -2676=7. So k12 \u22617 mod 12. If we want it to be divisible by 12, we need to add 5 to make it 2692 which is not divisible by 12? Let's check: 2692/12=224.333. Or subtract 7 gives 2676/12 =223 exactly. So if we set g(12)=-7 then k12 would be 2676, but that doesn't match given value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is not to force divisibility, but to express it in the form f(n)*n + g(n), where f(n) might come from previous keys sometimes. Notice that for key 5, they said k5 = k2 * k3, so maybe for key 12, they are using a similar idea: use k8 which is known from earlier in the sequence.\n\nSo possibly the intended answer: The pattern is not consistent; it's sometimes f(n)=k_n/n when that quotient is an integer (like n=8 and n=11), and sometimes f(n) seems to be one more than the nearest lower integer division (n=7 gives 11, n=9 gives 52). And for key 12, you can express it as k8\u00d712 -5, which suggests that f(12)=k8. So then f(12)=224.\n\nThen maybe we also have: for key 2 and 3, they might be defined in some way, but not given.\n\nI suspect the intended answer is something like:\n\n- For k7: f(7) = 11\n- For k8: f(8) = 28\n- For k9: f(9) = 52\n- For k11: f(11) = 105\n- For k12: f(12) = k8, i.e., 224\n\nBut then what about k5? They mentioned it but not in check.\n\nMaybe I should re-read the question: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" It might be that f(n)= floor(k_n/n + something). Looking at the given numbers:\nFor n=7: k7 =76, so 76/7 \u224810.857. The nearest integer is 11.\nFor n=8: 224/8=28 exactly.\nFor n=9: 467/9\u224851.888, so round to 52.\nFor n=11:1155/11=105 exactly.\nFor n=12: if we try dividing 2683 by 12, we get 223.583; but they already gave an expression for k12: k8\u00d712 -5. And since k8 =224, that suggests f(12)=224.\n\nSo maybe the answer is: \nf(7) = 11, f(8) = 28, f(9) = 52, f(11) =105, and f(12)=224.\nAnd then also note that for key 5, we have k5 = k2 * k3 (so maybe f(5) is not determined in the same way).\n\nI wonder if there's a pattern: 7 -> 11, 8 ->28, 9->52. Notice 11*7=77, and 77-1=76; 52*9=468, and 468-1=467; so for n=7 and 9, the multiplier is (k_n +1)/n. For n=8 and 11, it's exactly k_n/n. And for n=12, it's not k_n/n because that would be non-integral: 2683/12 =223.5833, but using k8 gives 224.\n\nMaybe the pattern is based on prime numbers: keys with composite indices sometimes use a different multiplier coming from an earlier key (like key 5 uses previous keys, key 12 uses key 8). It might be that f(n) for composite n equals f(p) where p is the largest prime factor of n? For example, for n=7 which is prime, f(7)=? But then 7 is prime and f(7)=11. For n=9, 9=3^2, so maybe use f(3)? That doesn't match because f(3) would be something else. Alternatively, maybe composite indices are expressed in terms of keys with factors that add up to the index or something.\n\nI note: k5 = k2 * k3. Then for key 12, they use k8, and 8 is not a factor of 12 though. Wait, what's special about 8? Possibly because 8 is one more than 7. And 7 and 9 are consecutive odd numbers, with multipliers 11 and 52 respectively.\n\nMaybe the intended answer: f(2)=? f(3)=?, f(5)=k2*k3 (so not computed), then for keys 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 we have:\nf(7) = \u230a76/7\u230b +1 = 10+1=11,\nf(8)=224/8=28,\nf(9)=\u230a467/9\u230b+1 =51+1=52,\nf(11)=1155/11=105,\nand for key 12, using the given formula, f(12)=k8 =224.\n\nI might then answer: \nFor keys where k_n/n is nearly an integer, take the ceiling (or nearest integer) to get f(n). That yields:\nf(7)=11, f(8)=28, f(9)=52, and f(11)=105. Also, note that key 12 can be expressed as k8\u00d712 -5, so we have an alternative expression with multiplier f(12)=k8=224.\n\nThis is a bit messy though.\n\nLet me re-read the question: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" It might be part of a riddle where you have keys 2,3,5,... and then instructions like \"key 7 is f(7)\" etc. Possibly the intended pattern is that the function f(n)= (n+4 choose something?) Not sure.\n\nMaybe there's another interpretation: The notation k_n means \"the key numbered n\". And f(n) might be defined by the formula:\nk_5 = k_2 * k_3,\nk_7 = 76,\nk_8 = 224,\nk_9 = 467,\nk_11=1155,\nk_12 = k_8\u00d712 -5.\n\nThen they ask: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly meaning \"What is the multiplier in front of n in the expression for k_n?\" That would be:\nFor k_7, we can write 76 = 11*7 -1.\nFor k_8, 224 = 28*8.\nFor k_9, 467 = 52*9 -1.\nFor k_11, 1155=105*11.\nFor k_12, 2683 = 224*12 -5.\n\nSo maybe f(7)=11, f(8)=28, f(9)=52, f(11)=105, and for key 12, if we try to write it in the form k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then f(12) would be (2683+5)/12=2688/12=224.\n\nSo answer: \nf(7)=11,\nf(8)=28,\nf(9)=52,\nf(11)=105,\nf(12)=224.\n\nThis seems to be the best interpretation.\n\nI should present that clearly.\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe express each key k_n as:\nk_5 = k_2 * k_3,\nk_7 = 76, which is nearly 11*7 (since 11\u00d77=77; difference -1),\nk_8 = 224 = 28\u00d78,\nk_9 = 467, which is nearly 52\u00d79 (since 52\u00d79=468; difference -1),\nk_11 = 1155 = 105\u00d711,\nand k_12 = 2683 can be written as 224\u00d712 \u2212 5.\n\nThus, the multipliers f(n) are:\nf(7)=11, f(8)=28, f(9)=52, f(11)=105, and for key 12 (using the provided expression), f(12)=k_8=224.\nAlternatively, one could write k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) where g(n) is a small correction term: g(7)= -1, g(9)= -1, g(12)= -5.\n\nI can then provide that answer.\n\nI'll now produce final answer.</think>One acceptable answer was to show that when you \u201csolve for the multiplier\u201d in an expression of the form\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + (a small correction),\n\nthen one may write\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2087 = 76 \u2248 11\u00d77 \u2013 1\u2003\u2003so that we take f(7)=11,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2088 = 224 = 28\u00d78\u2003\u2003so that f(8)=28,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2089 = 467 \u2248 52\u00d79 \u2013 1\u2003\u2003so that we take f(9)=52,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 1155 = 105\u00d711\u2003\u2003so that f(11)=105, and\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2081\u2082 is given by k\u2088\u00d712 \u2013 5; since k\u2088=224 we have k\u2081\u2082 = 224\u00d712 \u2013 5,\nwhich shows that if one writes k\u2081\u2082 in the form\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = f(12)\u00b712 + (\u20135)\nthen necessarily f(12)=224.\n\nIn other words, defining f(n) by writing each key as\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + (small \u201cerror\u201d term),\n\none may take\n\n\u2003\u2003f(7) = 11,\u2003f(8) = 28,\u2003f(9) = 52,\u2003f(11) = 105,\u2003and\u2003f(12) = 224.\n\nNote that the key numbered 5 is defined by\n\u2003\u2003k\u2085 = k\u2082 \u00b7 k\u2083,\nso its multiplier is not given in this way.\n\nAny answer which shows that when you \u201csolve for f(n)\u201d you obtain\n\n\u2003\u2003f(7)=11,\u2003f(8)=28,\u2003f(9)=52,\u2003f(11)=105,\u2003and\u2003f(12)=224\n\nis correct.",
