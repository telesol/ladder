  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check if there's a Fibonacci or golden ratio (phi) connection in these given ratios. Let me start by recalling that the golden ratio phi is approximately 1.618, and its square is about 2.618. The Fibonacci sequence is each number being the sum of the two preceding ones, like 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc. The ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers approach phi as they get larger. \n\nLooking at the given ratios first:\n\n- k8/k7 = 224/76 \u2248 2.947. Hmm, that's higher than phi squared (2.618). Not close to either phi or phi squared, so probably not related directly here.\n\n- k7/k6 = 76/49 \u2248 1.551. The problem mentions this is close to phi (1.618). It's a bit lower, but maybe in some context? The Fibonacci ratio of 8/5 is 1.6, which is closer to phi. Maybe there's a connection here?\n\n- k6/k5 = 49/21 \u2248 2.333. Not sure. The Fibonacci ratio of 21/13 is about 1.615, which is close to phi. Wait, but this is 2.333, which is roughly 7/3? Or maybe another ratio.\n\n- k5/k4 = 21/8 = 2.625. The problem points out this is close to phi squared (2.618). That's actually really close! The Fibonacci ratio of 34/13 is about 2.615, which is very close to phi squared. So 2.625 is 2.618 plus about 0.007, so almost there. Maybe this is part of a Fibonacci-like sequence?\n\n- k4/k3 = 8/7 \u2248 1.143. Not close to phi.\n\n- k3/k2 = 7/3 \u2248 2.333. Same as k6/k5. Not directly phi-related.\n\nThen, the problem mentions checking further ratios:\n\n- k14/k13 = 10544/5765 \u2248 1.829. Hmm, phi is ~1.618, so this is higher but not too far. Maybe a multiple? Let's see, 1.829 divided by phi is about 1.13, not sure.\n\n- k13/k12 = 5765/2683 \u2248 2.148. Phi squared is ~2.618, so lower than that. Maybe another Fibonacci ratio? The Fibonacci ratio of 144/89 \u2248 1.618 (phi), 233/144 \u2248 1.618, so maybe not here.\n\n- k12/k11 = 2683/1155 \u2248 2.323. Again, similar to previous ratios. 2.323 is close to 2.333 (from k6/k5 and k3/k2). Not sure yet.\n\nThe problem states that k7/k6 is close to phi (their ratio is 1.551 vs phi 1.618), and k5/k4 is very close to phi squared (2.625 vs 2.618). Maybe there's a Fibonacci-like sequence here? Let's see the numbers given:\n\nAssuming k2 to k8 are the numbers given in the ratios. Let's list them:\n\nk2: 3\n\nk3: 7\n\nk4: 8\n\nk5:21\n\nk6:49\n\nk7:76\n\nk8:224\n\nWait, let me check that. The first ratio given is k8/k7 = 224/76. So k7 is 76, k8 is 224. Then k6 is 49 (since k7/k6 = 76/49). k5 is 21 (k6/k5 =49/21). k4 is 8 (k5/k4 =21/8). k3 is 7 (k4/k3 =8/7). k2 is 3 (k3/k2 =7/3). \n\nSo the sequence from k2 to k8 is: 3, 7, 8, 21, 49, 76, 224.\n\nLet me see if this follows a Fibonacci-like pattern. Let's check each term:\n\nk2 =3, k3=7. To get k4, maybe adding? 3 +7=10, but k4 is 8, so no. Alternatively, 7 + something =8? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe a different recurrence. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\n3,7,8,21,49,76,224.\n\nCheck if each term is a combination of previous terms. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n7: how do you get from 3 to 7? Maybe 3*2 +1? Not sure.\n\n8: from 7? 7 +1=8. Maybe adding previous term?\n\n21: 8 +7 +6? Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each term is the sum of the previous two terms? Let's check:\n\nk3 = 7. If Fibonacci, 3 + previous term? But we need two starting terms. If starting at k2=3, k3=7, then k4 would be 3 +7=10, but actual k4 is 8. Not quite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a different multiplier. Let me see the differences between terms:\n\n7 -3 =4\n\n8 -7=1\n\n21 -8=13\n\n49 -21=28\n\n76 -49=27\n\n224 -76=148\n\nHmm, the differences are 4,1,13,28,27,148. Not obvious pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the ratios:\n\nk3/k2 =7/3\u22482.333\n\nk4/k3=8/7\u22481.142\n\nk5/k4=21/8\u22482.625 (close to phi squared)\n\nk6/k5=49/21\u22482.333\n\nk7/k6=76/49\u22481.551 (close to phi)\n\nk8/k7=224/76\u22482.947\n\nHmm, the ratios alternate between ~2.333, ~1.142, ~2.625, ~2.333, ~1.551, ~2.947. Not sure, but some of them are close to phi or phi squared.\n\nThe problem mentions that k5/k4 is close to phi squared (2.625 vs 2.618), so that's almost exact. And k7/k6 is close to phi (1.551 vs 1.618). So maybe the sequence is designed to have some ratios approaching phi and its square?\n\nLooking at the extended ratios given:\n\nk14/k13 = ~1.829\n\nk13/k12 = ~2.148\n\nk12/k11 = ~2.323\n\nHmm, 2.148 is close to sqrt(phi)? Let's see sqrt(phi) is ~1.272, so no. Or maybe another Fibonacci ratio? Let me think. For example, the ratio between Fibonacci numbers after a few terms: 144/89 is ~1.618, then 233/144\u22481.618, so they stabilize. But here, the ratios are varying. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence follows a different recurrence relation involving phi? For instance, a recurrence relation like x_n = x_{n-1} + x_{n-2}, which is Fibonacci, but here maybe multiplied by something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each term is a multiple of Fibonacci numbers? Let me check:\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence starting from 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610, etc.\n\nLooking at the given terms:\n\nk2=3 (Fibonacci 4th term? F4=3)\n\nk3=7 (Fibonacci 6th term is 8, so not exactly)\n\nk4=8 (Fibonacci 6th term)\n\nk5=21 (Fibonacci 8th term is 21)\n\nk6=49 (Fibonacci 9 is 34, 10 is 55, so no)\n\nHmm. Maybe offset? Let's see:\n\nk2=3=F4, k3=7=F6-1, k4=8=F6, k5=21=F8, k6=49 which is not F10 (55), but close. Maybe F8 + F7=21+13=34? Not quite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplied by some constants? 3 is F4, 7 is F6-1, 8=F6, 21=F8, 49= (F10 is 55, so 55-6=49?), not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is a combination of Fibonacci numbers? Let's see:\n\nLooking at k5 =21=F8, k6=49= F9 (34) + F8 (21)=55? No, 34+21=55. Hmm, no. 21+28=49? Not Fibonacci.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each term is the sum of previous terms in some way. Let's see:\n\nStarting from k2=3:\n\nk3=7: 3 + something?\n\nIf k3 = k2 + previous? But we need another starting point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined by a recurrence relation like x_n = x_{n-1} + x_{n-2} + ... but with some coefficients?\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the Fibonacci sequence ratios again. Since phi squared is about 2.618, which is very close to k5/k4 (21/8=2.625). That's a near miss. Maybe if the terms were part of a Fibonacci-like sequence that approaches phi ratios?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is similar to Fibonacci but starts with different initial terms. Let's try to see:\n\nSuppose we have a sequence starting with a and b, then each subsequent term is a + b? Let's see:\n\nSuppose starting with k2=3 and k3=7:\n\nk4 = 3 +7=10, but actual k4 is 8. Not quite.\n\nAlternatively, k4 = 2*3 +7=13? Not 8.\n\nAlternatively, k4 =7 + (3* something). 7 +1=8. Maybe k4 = previous term + something?\n\nWait, maybe a different recurrence. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\n3, 7, 8,21,49,76,224.\n\nTrying to find a pattern between terms:\n\nFrom 3 to7: 7 = 3*2 +1\n\n7 to8: 8 =7 +1\n\n8 to21: 21=8*2 +5\n\n21 to49: 49=21 + 28 (but 28 is 21 +7)\n\n49 to76: 76=49 +27 (27 is 21 +6? Not sure)\n\n76 to224: 224=76*3 - 224-76=148. Hmm, 148 is twice 74, but not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, multiplicative factors:\n\n7 /3 \u22482.333\n\n8/7\u22481.142\n\n21/8\u22482.625\n\n49/21\u22482.333\n\n76/49\u22481.551\n\n224/76\u22482.947\n\nSo the ratios alternate between ~2.33, ~1.14, ~2.625, ~2.33, ~1.55, ~2.947. The closest to phi (~1.618) are 1.55 and 2.625 (which is ~phi squared). \n\nSo maybe this is a quasi-Fibonacci sequence where every other term approaches phi or phi squared?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is constructed so that every third term has a ratio close to phi squared? For example, k5/k4\u2248phi\u00b2, k8/k7\u2248something else, but k8/k7 is 224/76\u22482.947, which is higher than phi squared. \n\nAlternatively, if you consider the ratio of k7/k6\u22481.55, which is close to phi, and k5/k4\u2248phi squared, maybe there's an underlying pattern where every two steps the ratio alternates between approaching phi and phi squared?\n\nLooking further at the extended terms:\n\nk14/k13\u22481.829, which is between phi and phi squared.\n\nk13/k12\u22482.148, which is closer to sqrt(5)\u22482.236? Not quite.\n\nk12/k11\u22482.323, which is close to 2.333 (the ratio of k6/k5 and k3/k2). So maybe there's a cycle here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratios alternate in some way. Let me list all the ratios again:\n\nk3/k2 \u22482.333\n\nk4/k3\u22481.142\n\nk5/k4\u22482.625 (\u2248phi\u00b2)\n\nk6/k5\u22482.333\n\nk7/k6\u22481.551 (\u2248phi)\n\nk8/k7\u22482.947\n\nk9/k8 (if existed) ?\n\nWait, the problem mentions up to k14. Maybe the pattern continues? Let me see:\n\nSuppose the ratios alternate between ~2.33, ~1.14, ~2.625, ~2.33, ~1.55, ~2.947, then maybe next would be ~something else? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is following a second-order linear recurrence, like x_n = a*x_{n-1} + b*x_{n-2}? Let's try to find a and b.\n\nTake the first few terms to set up equations.\n\nSuppose the recurrence is x_n = a*x_{n-1} + b*x_{n-2}\n\nWe can use terms k2=3, k3=7, k4=8, k5=21.\n\nSo for n=4 (k4=8):\n\n8 = a*7 + b*3\n\nFor n=5 (k5=21):\n\n21 = a*8 + b*7\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n7a + 3b =8\n\n8a +7b=21\n\nLet me solve this system:\n\nMultiply first equation by 8: 56a +24b =64\n\nMultiply second equation by7:56a +49b =147\n\nSubtract first from second: (56a +49b) - (56a +24b)=147-64 =>25b=83 => b=83/25\u22483.32\n\nThen plug back into first equation:7a +3*(83/25)=8\n\n7a =8 - 249/25 = (200 -249)/25= (-49)/25 => a = (-49/25)/7= -49/175\u2248-0.28\n\nHmm, that gives a negative coefficient. Doesn't seem right. Maybe the recurrence is different?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a third-order recurrence? Let me try with more terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recurrence is x_n = x_{n-1} + x_{n-2} + ...?\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me see how the terms are built:\n\nStarting from 3,7,8,21,49,76,224...\n\nLooking at 3 to7: 3 +7=10, but next is8, so subtract 2? Not sure.\n\n7 to8: 7 +1=8\n\n8 to21: 8*2 +5=21?\n\n21 to49: 21 +28=49, where 28 is previous difference (21-8=13? Not sure)\n\nAlternatively, 21+28=49, and 28 is 7*4?\n\nAlternatively, 49 to76: 49 +27=76, 27= previous difference?\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is related to the Fibonacci sequence but with some scaling factors. Let me see:\n\nFibonacci numbers: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,...\n\nIf we take every other term or something. For example:\n\nTerm 3 is 7 vs Fibonacci term 6 (8). Close but off by 1.\n\nTerm 5 is21 which is Fibonacci term8.\n\nTerm6 is49 vs Fibonacci term10 (55). Off by 6.\n\nTerm7 is76 vs Fibonacci term12 (144). Not close.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiplying by some factors. Let's see:\n\nTerm2=3=3*1\n\nTerm3=7=7*1\n\nTerm4=8=2^3\n\nTerm5=21=3*7\n\nTerm6=49=7^2\n\nTerm7=76=4*19? Not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's a combination of two Fibonacci sequences? Maybe adding terms from two different Fibonacci sequences?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are part of a different recurrence. Let me try another method.\n\nLet me consider the terms from k2 to k7:\n\n3,7,8,21,49,76,224\n\nLooking at the differences between terms:\n\n7-3=4\n\n8-7=1\n\n21-8=13\n\n49-21=28\n\n76-49=27\n\n224-76=148\n\nHmm, differences: 4,1,13,28,27,148. Not sure.\n\nLooking at the differences of differences:\n\n1-4= -3\n\n13-1=12\n\n28-13=15\n\n27-28=-1\n\n148-27=121\n\nStill not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, the ratios between differences:\n\n1/4=0.25\n\n13/1=13\n\n28/13\u22482.15\n\n27/28\u22480.96\n\n148/27\u22485.48\n\nNo clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, multiplying factors:\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\n3,7,8,21,49,76,224\n\nNotice that 21 is 3*7, 49 is7*7, 76 is 4*19, 224 is 32*7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 3,7,8,21,49,76,224:\n\n3+7=10; 10+8=18; 18+21=39; 39+49=88; 88+76=164; 164+224=388. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, products:\n\n3*7=21 which is the fourth term? 3*7=21, but term5 is21. So term5=3*7?\n\nThen 7*8=56 vs term6=49. Not quite.\n\nAlternatively, 8*21=168 vs term7=76. No.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe the key is just that some ratios are close to phi or phi squared?\n\nThe problem states that some ratios are close to phi (\u22481.618) and phi squared (\u22482.618). For instance, k5/k4\u22482.625 (very close to phi\u00b2), and k7/k6\u22481.55 (close to phi). The question might be asking to recognize that this sequence approximates the Fibonacci sequence's properties, where the ratio between consecutive terms approaches phi, but here maybe with a different starting point?\n\nAlternatively, the sequence might be following a recurrence relation similar to Fibonacci but with different coefficients, leading to those ratios.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a Fibonacci sequence starting with different initial terms. Let's try:\n\nSuppose a Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 3 and 7:\n\nTerm1=3, term2=7, then term3=3+7=10, but our third term is8. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, term3=term2 - term1=4, but that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe term3=term1 + something.\n\nAlternatively, start with different coefficients:\n\nSuppose the recurrence is x_{n} = x_{n-1} + 2*x_{n-2}\n\nTesting:\n\nStart with 3 and7:\n\nterm3=7 +2*3=13, but actual term3 is8. Not.\n\nAlternatively x_{n}=2*x_{n-1} + x_{n-2}\n\nterm3=2*7 +3=17, nope.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are related to the Fibonacci sequence scaled by some factor:\n\nLet me see:\n\nIf term2=3 is F4 (Fibonacci term4=3),\n\nterm3=7 is F6 (8) minus 1,\n\nterm4=8=F6,\n\nterm5=21=F8,\n\nterm6=49=F10 (55) minus 6,\n\nterm7=76=F12 (144) minus 68,\n\nHmm, not a consistent pattern.\n\nAlternatively, term6=49 is F7 (13) + F8 (21) + F9 (34) =68? No, that's 68. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the Fibonacci sequence multiplied by 3:\n\n3*F2=3*1=3,\n\n3*F3=3*2=6\u22607,\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, 3,7,8,21,49,76,224 could be related to the Fibonacci word or another Fibonacci-based structure, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might just be pointing out that in this sequence, certain ratios approach the golden ratio, similar to Fibonacci numbers, even though the starting terms are different. For example, in the Fibonacci sequence, the ratio between successive terms approaches phi, so even with different starting terms, the ratio still approaches phi (for the standard linear recurrence). But in this case, the terms are not following the Fibonacci recurrence, so the ratios don't stabilize but instead approach different values?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is constructed such that every second term has a ratio close to phi squared?\n\nFor example:\n\nk5/k4=21/8\u22482.625 (\u2248phi\u00b2),\n\nk7/k6=76/49\u22481.551 (\u2248phi),\n\nk9/k8 (if existed) might approach phi squared again?\n\nBut since the problem mentions up to k14, but we don't have all terms, maybe it's expecting an explanation about the ratios being close to phi and phi squared?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where the sequence is actually Fibonacci numbers with some terms omitted or altered, but given the numbers provided (3,7,8,21,49,76,224), it's not obvious. \n\nWait, perhaps the terms are following the recurrence relation x\u2099 = x\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 2x\u2099\u208b\u2082?\n\nLet me check:\n\nStarting with x\u2081=3, x\u2082=7,\n\nx\u2083=7 + 2*3 =13 \u22608. Not.\n\nAlternatively x\u2099 = x\u2099\u208b\u2081 + x\u2099\u208b\u2082 - something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is x\u2099 = x\u2099\u208b\u2081 \u00d7 2 - x\u2099\u208b\u2082 ?\n\nTesting:\n\nx3=7\u00d72 -3=11\u22608.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, x\u2099 = (x\u2099\u208b\u2081 \u00d7 something) + (x\u2099\u208b\u2082 \u00d7 something else).\n\nLet me try with the first few terms:\n\nTo get x\u2084=8 from x\u2083=7 and x\u2082=3,\n\nmaybe 7*1 +3*0.333=7+1=8. So coefficients 1 and 1/3?\n\nThen for x\u2085=21 from x\u2084=8 and x\u2083=7,\n\n8*a +7*b=21.\n\nSuppose a=2 and b=1: 16+7=23\u226021.\n\na=1.5, b=1.857: Not clean.\n\nAlternatively, 8*2 +7*1=23, too much.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is related to the Fibonacci numbers but with a different starting point and the ratios converge to phi eventually. For example, even if the first few terms don't follow the Fibonacci recurrence, after some terms the ratios start approaching phi?\n\nAlternatively, the problem is just asking to notice that some ratios here are close to the golden ratio and its square, similar to the Fibonacci sequence, so the answer is that the sequence approximates the Fibonacci sequence's property where the ratio of consecutive terms approaches the golden ratio.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be expecting the recognition that the given terms include Fibonacci numbers like 3 (F4), 8 (F6), 21 (F8), 144 (if it were there), but 49 and 76 are not Fibonacci numbers. 49 is 7 squared, 76 is not special. 224 is 32\u00d77. Hmm.\n\nWait, 3, 7, 8, 21, 49, 76, 224:\n\n3 to 7: ratio ~2.33\n\n7 to8: ~1.14\n\n8 to21: ~2.625 (close to phi\u00b2)\n\n21 to49: ~2.333\n\n49 to76: ~1.551 (close to phi)\n\n76 to224: ~2.947\n\nSo alternating between ratios above and below phi\u00b2? Not exactly, but the two notable ones are 2.625 (very close to phi squared) and 1.55 (close to phi). Maybe the question is pointing out that in this sequence, certain term ratios are close to the golden ratio and its square, similar to the Fibonacci sequence, hence the golden ratio is involved here.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be expecting to state that the sequence is related to the Fibonacci numbers because those key ratios (phi and phi squared) are prominent in the Fibonacci sequence and here they appear in this sequence's term ratios, so the golden ratio is significant here.\n\nGiven that the problem mentions \"golden ratio (phi)\", and asks for a boxed answer, perhaps the answer is simply the golden ratio, but phrased as \\boxed{\\phi} or its numerical value. But the question says \"Explain why the golden ratio (phi) is involved in this sequence,\" so maybe the explanation is needed, but since the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", maybe they want the key term boxed.\n\nWait, the original problem might have been in Chinese, given the user's instruction mentions \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". Maybe the question is \"Why is the golden ratio involved in this sequence?\" and the answer is that the ratios between terms approach the golden ratio, so the key point is the golden ratio is the limit of the ratio of consecutive terms in Fibonacci-like sequences, hence boxed as phi. But given the terms here don't form a Fibonacci sequence but some ratios are close, maybe the answer is that the golden ratio appears in the ratios of some terms, hence boxed as \\boxed{\\phi}.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is asking to find a term or a value related to the golden ratio in the sequence, but without more context, it's hard to tell. Since the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", I might have to infer the expected answer. Given that the golden ratio is involved because some term ratios approach it (similar to Fibonacci), the key is phi, so boxed.\n\nBut since the problem mentions \"this sequence\", perhaps the sequence provided (the terms given) have a relation where the ratio between terms 5/4 and 7/6 are close to phi squared and phi, so the golden ratio is involved because those key ratios appear. Thus, the answer is that the golden ratio is involved because the ratios between certain terms approximate phi and phi squared, similar to the Fibonacci sequence. But to put in boxed, maybe just the golden ratio symbol.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the value of phi, which is (1+sqrt(5))/2 \u22481.618, so boxed as \\boxed{\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}}.\n\nConsidering all possibilities, since the problem mentions the golden ratio is involved in the sequence, the most precise answer would be to present the golden ratio in a box. Since mathematical answers often box expressions, likely \\boxed{\\phi} or the exact value.\n\nBut since phi is (1+\\sqrt{5})/2, perhaps that's expected. Alternatively, given the terms in the sequence, maybe solving for a recurrence that leads to the golden ratio as the characteristic equation's root.\n\nSuppose the sequence follows a linear recurrence. If the problem is in Chinese and the user is translating, maybe there was a specific question like \"What is the golden ratio in this sequence?\" requiring the value.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence might be designed such that a certain term or ratio equals phi, but given the numbers 3,7,8,21,49,76,224, the closest is 21/8\u22482.625 which is phi squared (since phi^2\u22482.618), so that's very close. Similarly 76/49\u22481.55 which is near phi\u22481.618. So explaining that those key ratios are close to phi squared and phi, hence the golden ratio is involved. Therefore, the answer might be that the ratio between the 5th and 4th terms is approximately phi squared, and between the 7th and 6th terms is approximately phi, so the golden ratio is involved in the sequence's ratios.\n\nBut the user instruction says to put the final answer in a box. If it's a numerical value, maybe they want phi expressed as (1+\u221a5)/2, so boxed as \\boxed{\\dfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}}.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is asking for an explanation, but instructions say to put the final answer in a box, maybe the key term is phi, so \\boxed{\\phi}.\n\nConsidering standard practice for math problems, when the question is about the golden ratio's involvement and asks for an answer in a box, it's likely expecting the expression for phi. Hence I will go with \\boxed{\\dfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}}.\n</think>\n\nThe golden ratio, denoted by \\(\\phi\\), is involved in this sequence because the ratios between certain consecutive terms approximate \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\phi^2\\). For example, the ratio of the 5th term to the 4th term (\\(21/8 \\approx 2.625\\)) is very close to \\(\\phi^2 \\approx 2.618\\), and the ratio of the 7th term to the 6th term (\\(76/49 \\approx 1.551\\)) is close to \\(\\phi \\approx 1.618\\). These approximations highlight the connection to the golden ratio, which is a fundamental property of Fibonacci-like sequences where consecutive term ratios approach \\(\\phi\\). \n\nThe golden ratio \\(\\phi\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}}\n\\]",
