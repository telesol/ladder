  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence, which is k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}, or maybe even with an added constant c. The problem gives me the values for k7 and k8, which are 76 and 224 respectively, and mentions that to predict k15 and k16, we need to find such a recurrence. \n\nFirst, let me focus on the first part without the constant c. The equations given are:\n\nFor k7 = 76: 76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224: 224 = 76a + 49b\n\nI need to solve this system of equations for a and b. Let me write them down again:\n\n1) 49a + 21b = 76\n\n2) 76a + 49b = 224\n\nHmm, solving this system... Since there are two equations and two variables, it should be possible unless they are dependent or inconsistent. Let me try using the elimination method.\n\nFirst, maybe I can multiply the first equation by 76 and the second by 49 to eliminate 'a'? Wait, that might get messy. Alternatively, maybe solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nLet me take the first equation: 49a + 21b = 76. Let me simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 7 to make the numbers smaller. 49 divided by 7 is 7, 21 divided by 7 is 3, and 76 divided by 7 is approximately 10.857... Hmm, but 76 isn't divisible by 7, so maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe keep it as is.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote equation 1 as:\n\n49a = 76 - 21b\n\nSo a = (76 - 21b)/49\n\nThen plug this into equation 2:\n\n76a + 49b = 224\n\nSubstitute a:\n\n76*( (76 - 21b)/49 ) + 49b = 224\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, 76 divided by 49 is 76/49, so:\n\n76*(76 -21b)/49 + 49b = 224\n\nMultiply out:\n\n(76*76)/49 - (76*21b)/49 + 49b = 224\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 76\u00b2 / 49. Let me calculate 76 squared: 76*76 is 5776. So 5776 / 49. Let me see, 49*118 is 5782, which is too big. 49*117 = 5733, so 5776 - 5733 = 43, so 5776/49 is 117 + 43/49 \u2248 117.877...\n\nSecond term: (76*21)/49 * b. 76*21 is 1596, so 1596/49 = let's see, 49*32 = 1568, so 1596 -1568 =28, so 1596/49 =32 + 28/49 =32 +4/7. So that term is - (32 +4/7) b\n\nThird term is +49b\n\nPutting all together:\n\n117.877... - (32 +4/7)b +49b = 224\n\nCombine the b terms:\n\n[ -32 -4/7 +49 ] b = (16.857...)b ?\n\nWait let me compute coefficients properly:\n\nLet me do fractions instead of decimals to be precise.\n\nFirst term: 5776/49\n\nSecond term: - (1596/49) b\n\nThird term: 49b = (49*49/49) b = (2401/49)b\n\nWait, actually:\n\nWait, the equation after substitution was:\n\n(76*(76 -21b))/49 +49b =224\n\nWait, actually, expanding:\n\n76*(76 -21b)/49 +49b =224\n\nSo, let me write all terms over 49 to combine them:\n\n[76*(76 -21b) + 49b *49 ] /49 =224\n\nWait, maybe that's a better approach. Let me write the entire left side over 49:\n\n[76*(76 -21b) + 49b *49 ] /49 = 224\n\nMultiply both sides by 49:\n\n76*(76 -21b) + 49\u00b2 b =224*49\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term:76*76 =5776; 76*(-21b) =-1596b\n\nSecond term:49\u00b2b =2401b\n\nThird term:224*49. Let's compute that: 224*50 =11200, minus 224 gives 11200-224=10976\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b =10976\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n5776 + (2401b -1596b) =10976\n\n2401 -1596 is 805, so 805b\n\nThus:\n\n5776 +805b =10976\n\nSubtract 5776 from both sides:\n\n805b =10976 -5776\n\nCompute 10976 -5776: 10976-5000=5976, then -5776+5000= -776? Wait, no, sorry:\n\nWait 10976 minus 5776:\n\n10976 - 5000 =5976\n\n5976 - 776 =5200? Wait, no, perhaps better:\n\n10976 -5776:\n\nSubtract 5000 from 10976: 5976\n\nThen subtract 776 more: 5976 -700=5276, then -76=5100? Wait, maybe I should do it properly:\n\n5776 + 5200 = 10976? Wait 5776 +5200 =10976? Let's see, 5000+5000=10000, then 776+200=976, so 10000+976=10976. Yes, so 5200 is 5200. Wait, but 10976 -5776 is 5200.\n\nWait 10976 -5776:\n\n10,000 -5,000 =5,000\n\n976 -776 =200\n\nTotal is 5,200. Yes, so 805b =5200\n\nThus, b =5200 /805\n\nLet me simplify this fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n5200 /5 =1040\n\n805 /5=161\n\nSo 1040 /161\n\nHmm, can this be simplified further? Let's check if 1040 and 161 have common factors.\n\n161 is 7\u00d723, since 7\u00d723=161\n\n1040 divided by 7: 1040/7\u2248148.57, which is not integer. 1040 divided by 23: 23\u00d745=1035, so 1040-1035=5, so remainder 5. So no, so 1040/161 is reduced.\n\nSo b =1040/161\u22486.46\n\nHmm, but the problem said \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So if b is not an integer, then perhaps such integers don't exist. Wait maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait let me check my steps again because I might have messed up in the algebra.\n\nStarting with substitution:\n\nFrom equation1: a=(76 -21b)/49\n\nThen plug into equation2:\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nSo 76*( (76 -21b)/49 ) +49b =224\n\nMultiply out:\n\n(76*76)/49 - (76*21b)/49 +49b =224\n\nSo that is:\n\n(5776)/49 - (1596b)/49 +49b =224\n\nConvert all terms to have denominator 49:\n\n5776/49 -1596b/49 + (49b *49)/49 =224\n\nWait, that third term is (49b)*(49)/49? Wait, no, actually:\n\nWait 49b is the same as (49b *49)/49? No, that's not right. Wait, 49b is equal to (49b *49)/49? That would be incorrect. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, to get a common denominator of 49, the term 49b can be written as (49b *49)/49, but that would be overcomplicating. Alternatively, just convert 49b to (49b *49)/49? Wait no. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me represent the equation as:\n\n[76*(76 -21b) +49\u00b2 b ] /49 =224\n\nWait, that might have been a mistake in my previous step. Let me recast:\n\nOriginal equation after substitution:\n\n76*(76 -21b)/49 +49b =224\n\nMultiply both sides by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49b*49 =224*49\n\nAh, yes. So that is correct.\n\nSo expanding that:\n\nFirst term:76*76 -76*21b\n\nSecond term:+49\u00b2 b\n\nThird term: 224*49\n\nSo:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b =10976\n\nSo combining the b terms: (2401 -1596)b =805b\n\nThus, 5776 +805b =10976\n\nThen 805b =10976 -5776 =5200\n\nSo b=5200/805. Let me compute that fraction again.\n\n5200 divided by 805.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 1040 /161\n\n161 is 7\u00d723. Let me see if 1040 is divisible by 7: 7\u00d7148=1036, so 1040-1036=4, so no. 1040 divided by 23 is 45.21... Not integer. So yes, it reduces to 1040/161\u22486.46, which is not an integer. So that suggests that with integer a and b, there is no solution?\n\nHmm. But the problem says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" Maybe they are expecting non-integer coefficients? Or maybe I made a mistake in calculation?\n\nWait, let me check the equations again.\n\nThe problem states:\n\nFor k7=76: 76 = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}\n\nAssuming n=7, so k7 =a\u00d7k6 +b\u00d7k5\n\nWait, hold on, the user hasn't given the previous terms. Wait, the problem says \"For k7=76: 76 =a\u00d749 +b\u00d721\" and \"For k8=224: 224 =a\u00d776 +b\u00d749\". So they must have provided the values of k5 and k6?\n\nWait, maybe the user is assuming that k5 is 21 and k6 is 49? Because otherwise, the problem statement is incomplete. Let me check the original problem again:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"Does the sequence follow a recurrence like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\n\nTEST: Can we find a, b such that k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\n\nFor k7 = 76:\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n224 = 76a + 49b\n\nSolve system:\nFrom first: 76 = 49a + 21b\nFrom second: 224 = 76a + 49b\n\nCan you find integer a, b?\"\n\nAh, okay, so in the equations, they've substituted k6 and k5 into the recurrence for k7 and k8. Therefore, presumably, k5 is 21 and k6 is 49. So the previous terms are known? The problem didn't list all the terms but just gave equations for k7 and k8 based on prior terms. \n\nBut even so, the equations are as given, so we can proceed with those equations. \n\nSo, with the equations:\n\n49a +21b =76\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nWe need to solve for a and b. Since we want integer solutions, but when I computed b=5200/805\u22486.46, which is not integer, so that would suggest there are no integer solutions. Hmm. But maybe there was an error in the algebra?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use another method. Let me try solving the equations again using another approach.\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me try to solve this system using elimination. Let's try to eliminate one variable. Let's try to eliminate 'a' first. \n\nMultiply equation1 by 76 and equation2 by 49, so that the coefficients of 'a' will be 49\u00d776 and 76\u00d749, so same, then subtract:\n\nMultiply equation1 by76:\n\n49\u00d776 a +21\u00d776 b =76\u00d776\n\nMultiply equation2 by49:\n\n76\u00d749 a +49\u00d749 b =224\u00d749\n\nNow subtract the first new equation from the second:\n\n[76\u00d749a +49\u00b2b] - [49\u00d776a +21\u00d776b] =224\u00d749 -76\u00d776\n\nCompute left side:\n\n76\u00d749a -49\u00d776a =0 (they cancel)\n\n49\u00b2b -21\u00d776b = b*(49\u00b2 -21\u00d776)\n\nRight side:\n\n224\u00d749 -76\u00d776\n\nSo compute left side:\n\n49\u00b2 is 2401, 21\u00d776=1596\n\nThus, 2401 -1596 =805. So left side is 805b\n\nRight side:\n\n224\u00d749: 224\u00d750=11200, minus 224 gives 11200-224=10976\n\n76\u00d776=5776\n\nThus, right side is 10976 -5776 =5200\n\nThus, 805b=5200 \u2192 b=5200/805= same as before, so 1040/161\u22486.46\n\nSame result as before. So indeed, the same answer. So that suggests there are no integer solutions for a and b. \n\nHmm, so maybe the recurrence isn't of that form with integer coefficients. Perhaps the user expects fractions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the earlier terms. Wait, but the user provided the equations directly, so unless there is a typo in coefficients? Let me check if with different a and b, maybe rounding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where there are no integer solutions, so the answer is no? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check the equations again. Let me check if 49a +21b=76 and 76a +49b=224 can be solved with fractions.\n\nLet me solve for a from equation1:\n\n49a =76 -21b \u2192 a=(76 -21b)/49\n\nPlug into equation2:\n\n76*(76-21b)/49 +49b =224\n\nMultiply through by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49\u00b2 b =224\u00d749\n\nWhich is exactly what I did before, leading to same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended different coefficients? Let me see, maybe 21 and 49 are from prior terms, but if the prior terms were different, but the user hasn't given them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equations are correct but the question allows for non-integer a and b, but the user is asking for integer solutions. In that case, the answer would be that there are no integer solutions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is an error in the problem setup. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants us to proceed to see if fractional a and b work, but the question specifically asks for integers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the equations are different? Let me check once again:\n\nFor k7: 76 = a\u00d749 +b\u00d721. So if k6 is 49 and k5 is21, then that equation holds.\n\nFor k8:224 =a\u00d776 +b\u00d749. So k7 is76, k6 is49. So that equation holds. \n\nTherefore, given that, the equations are correct as per the given prior terms. \n\nHence, solving gives a non-integer solution, so maybe the answer is that there are no integer solutions, so the recurrence with integer coefficients does not hold. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem and the numbers are different? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants us to consider that the coefficients can be fractions, so the answer would be a= (76 -21b)/49 and with b=1040/161, so a would be:\n\na=(76 -21*(5200/805))/49. Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, 21*(5200/805)= (21*5200)/805. Let's compute 21*5200=109200, then divided by805: 109200/805.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 5: 21840/161\n\nThus, 76 - (21840/161) = (76*161 -21840)/161\n\nCompute 76*161: 70*161=11270; 6*161=966 \u2192 total 11270+966=12236\n\nSo 12236 -21840= -9604\n\nThus, numerator is -9604/161, so a= (-9604/161)/49 = (-9604)/(161*49)\n\nCompute 161*49: 161*50=8050 minus 161 \u2192 8050-161=7889\n\nThus, a= -9604/7889 \u2248-1.217\n\nSo a\u2248-1.217 and b\u22486.46.\n\nThese are fractional, non-integer. \n\nTherefore, if the question requires integer coefficients, then the answer is no, there are no integer solutions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows real numbers, in which case a and b can be expressed as fractions. But the question specifically asks for integer a and b, so the answer is that there are no integer solutions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the problem? Let me re-read:\n\n\"F: Does the sequence follow a recurrence like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}? TEST: Can we find a, b such that... For k7=76: 76= a\u00d749 +b\u00d721... For k8=224: 224= a\u00d776 +b\u00d749... Can you find integer a, b?\"\n\nSo the question is whether integer coefficients a and b exist. Since the solution requires a\u2248-1.217 and b\u22486.46, which are not integers, the answer is no. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that there are no integer coefficients a and b that satisfy the equations given for the terms k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, and k8=224. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that the user might have made a mistake in the numbers? If the numbers were different, like k7= something else, but as per the given problem, this is the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is expecting a different approach, such as solving the system of equations for a and b regardless of being integers, but the question specifically asks for integer a and b. \n\nThus, unless there's a miscalculation on my part, which I have checked multiple times, the conclusion is that there are no integer solutions. \n\nWait, but let me try plugging in some integer values to see if maybe a and b could be fractions but with small denominators?\n\nSuppose a and b are fractions with denominator 7?\n\nLet me assume a= p/7 and b=q/7 where p and q are integers. Then plug into equation1:\n\n49*(p/7) +21*(q/7)=7p +3q =76\n\nEquation2:76*(p/7)+49*(q/7)= (76p +49q)/7=224 \u219276p +49q=1568\n\nThus, now equations are:\n\n7p +3q=76\n\n76p +49q=1568\n\nLet me solve equation1 for p:7p=76-3q \u2192p=(76-3q)/7\n\nPlug into equation2:\n\n76*(76-3q)/7 +49q=1568\n\nMultiply through by7 to eliminate denominator:\n\n76*(76-3q)+343 q=1568\u00d77=10976\n\nCompute:\n\n76\u00d776=5776\n\n76\u00d7(-3q)= -228 q\n\nThus, total:\n\n5776 -228 q +343 q =5776 +115 q =10976\n\nThus, 115 q=10976-5776=5200 \u2192 q=5200/115=45.217\u2026 Not integer. So again, no solution with denominator 7.\n\nAlternatively, denominator 161? Probably not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system is set up wrong? Let me see:\n\nIf we think the problem may have a typo, but given the current numbers, it's insoluble with integers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that the solver has to consider that the user made an error? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in fractions, so a= -9604/7889 and b=1040/161, but that's complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended different prior terms? Let me see:\n\nSuppose the user had different prior terms. For instance, if k5 was 21 and k6 was 49, then k7 is 76, and k8 is224. Maybe we can check if those follow some pattern. Let me see:\n\n21,49,76,224,...\n\nLooking at differences:49-21=28; 76-49=27; 224-76=148. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, ratios:49/21\u22482.333, 76/49\u22481.55, 224/76\u22482.947. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recurrence has a constant term? The user also mentions in the problem \"F: Does the sequence follow a recurrence like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}? ... Alternatively, perhaps the problem is for a second-order linear recurrence with constant term, i.e., k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2} + c. Then, with three equations, we could solve for a,b,c. But the problem as posed doesn\u2019t mention a constant term. However, the user's initial question includes \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" So maybe the user expects the boxed answer to be the values of a and b, even if fractional?\n\nWait, the problem says \"Can you find integer a, b such that...\", so if they don't exist, then the answer is \"No, there are no such integers.\" But since the user asks to put the final answer in a box, maybe they expect the values of a and b as fractions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the calculations.\n\nLet me re-derive:\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) 49a +21b =76\n\n2)76a +49b =224\n\nLet me write them as:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me solve using elimination.\n\nMultiply equation1 by 49: 49*49a +49*21b =49*76 \u2192 2401a +1029b =3724\n\nMultiply equation2 by21:21*76a +21*49b =21*224 \u21921596a +1029b =4704\n\nNow subtract equation1*49 from equation2*21:\n\n(1596a +1029b) - (2401a +1029b) =4704 -3724\n\n\u2192(1596a -2401a) + (1029b -1029b)= 980\n\n\u2192-805a =980 \u2192 a= -980/805= simplify by 35: -28/23.0... Wait 980 divided by35 is28, 805 divided by35 is23. So a= -28/23\u2248-1.217, which matches prior.\n\nThen plug back into equation1:\n\n49*(-28/23) +21b =76\n\nCompute 49*(-28)/23= -1372/23\n\nThus, 21b =76 +1372/23 = (76*23 +1372)/23\n\nCompute 76*23: 70*23=1610, 6*23=138 \u2192 total 1610+138=1748\n\nThus numerator:1748+1372=3120 \u21923120/23\n\nThus, b= (3120/23)/(21)=3120/(23*21)=3120/483= divide numerator and denominator by3:1040/161\u22486.46\n\nThus, the exact fractions are a= -28/23 and b=1040/161.\n\nBut since the question asks for integer a and b, these fractions are not integers, so the answer is that there are no integer solutions. \n\nTherefore, the boxed answer might be stating that there's no solution, but the problem might expect expressing a and b as fractions? The problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", which usually expects a specific answer. Maybe the user intended for the solver to present the fractional forms?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed something in the problem. Since the original question is in Chinese, maybe some translation nuances? The original problem's instruction is \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" So maybe the user expects the values of a and b as boxed fractions?\n\nIf so, then:\n\na = \\boxed{-\\dfrac{28}{23}} and b = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1040}{161}}.\n\nBut since the problem specifies integer a and b, and these are not integers, maybe the problem is a trick question, and the answer is that there are no such integers, which can be represented as \\boxed{\\text{No solution}}.\n\nHowever, given the problem's structure, maybe the user intended different numbers, or there is a miscalculation. But as per given numbers, the conclusion is no integer solution exists.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me confirm:\n\nGiven the terms:\n\nk5 =21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nThen for the recurrence k_n =a*k_{n-1} +b*k_{n-2}:\n\nFor n=7: 76 =a*49 +b*21,\n\nFor n=8:224 =a*76 +b*49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the equations are correct, leading to the solution above.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that there are no integer solutions for a and b, so the boxed answer is \\boxed{\\text{No solution}}.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects the fractional answer? If so, then separate boxed answers for a and b:\n\na = \\boxed{-\\dfrac{28}{23}}, b = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1040}{161}}.\n\nBut given the problem asks for integer solutions, and the user might have expected that, perhaps the problem is designed to have a solution with different numbers. Alternatively, maybe I missed a negative sign?\n\nWait let me check the equations again.\n\nWait 49a +21b =76,\n\n76a +49b =224.\n\nLet me try a=2, b= (76 -49*2)/21=(76-98)/21= (-22)/21\u2248-1.047. Not integer.\n\na=1: 49 +21b=76 \u219221b=27\u2192b=27/21=9/7\u22481.285. Not integer.\n\na=0: 21b=76 \u2192b\u22483.619. No.\n\na= -1: -49 +21b=76\u219221b=125\u2192b\u22485.952.\n\na= -2: -98 +21b=76\u219221b=174\u2192b=174/21=5.8. Not integer.\n\na=3: 147 +21b=76 \u219221b= -71\u2192no.\n\na=4: 196 +21b=76\u219221b= -120\u2192b\u2248-5.714.\n\nHmm, none of these give integer b. Thus, no integer solutions exist.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no integer solutions.\n\nSince the problem asks for integer a and b, the final answer is that there is no solution. Since the instructions say to put the final answer in a box, perhaps:\n\n\\boxed{\\text{No solution}}\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the values of a and b as fractions in boxed form:\n\nThe values are a = -28/23 and b = 1040/161. \n\nBut since the problem specifies integer coefficients, which do not exist, the appropriate answer is \"No solution\" in a box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\text{No solution}}\n</think>\n\nGiven the problem, we need to determine if there exist integer coefficients \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that the sequence follows the recurrence relation \\(k_n = a \\cdot k_{n-1} + b \\cdot k_{n-2}\\) for the given terms \\(k_5 = 21\\), \\(k_6 = 49\\), \\(k_7 = 76\\), and \\(k_8 = 224\\).\n\nWe set up the following system of equations based on the given terms:\n\n1. For \\(k_7 = 76\\):\n   \\[\n   49a + 21b = 76\n   \\]\n\n2. For \\(k_8 = 224\\):\n   \\[\n   76a + 49b = 224\n   \\]\n\nTo solve this system, we use the elimination method. First, we multiply the equations to align the coefficients:\n\n- Multiply the first equation by 49:\n  \\[\n  2401a + 1029b = 3724\n  \\]\n\n- Multiply the second equation by 21:\n  \\[\n  1596a + 1029b = 4704\n  \\]\n\nSubtracting the first modified equation from the second:\n\\[\n(1596a + 1029b) - (2401a + 1029b) = 4704 - 3724\n\\]\n\\[\n-805a = 980\n\\]\n\\[\na = \\frac{-980}{805} = \\frac{-28}{23}\n\\]\n\nNext, substitute \\(a = -\\frac{28}{23}\\) back into the first original equation to solve for \\(b\\):\n\\[\n49\\left(-\\frac{28}{23}\\right) + 21b = 76\n\\]\n\\[\n-\\frac{1372}{23} + 21b = 76\n\\]\n\\[\n21b = 76 + \\frac{1372}{23}\n\\]\n\\[\n21b = \\frac{1748 + 1372}{23}\n\\]\n\\[\n21b = \\frac{3120}{23}\n\\]\n\\[\nb = \\frac{3120}{23 \\cdot 21} = \\frac{1040}{161}\n\\]\n\nThe solutions for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are fractions, not integers. Therefore, there are no integer solutions for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) that satisfy the given recurrence relation with the provided terms.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No solution}}\n\\]",
