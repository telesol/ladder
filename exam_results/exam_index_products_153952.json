Wait re-read carefully.\n\nThe prompt says:\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7=10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8=28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9=51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11=105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12=223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo apparently, some of these keys follow the pattern: k_n = f(n) * n + g(n). For some values, when divided by n they yield an integer value f(n).\n\nWe have computed:\nf(7) is not integer (76/7 ~ 10.857)\nFor k8, we got f(8)=28. For k9, not integer, for k11, f(11)=105.\nFor k12, apparently the product formula k12 = k8 * 12 - 5, so k8=28 then k8*12-5=336-5=331? Wait re-read: \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12=223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\" So if we plug in k8=28, then 28*12 - 5=336-5=331 not equal to 2683 obviously.\n\nLet's re-read the prompt carefully: \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\n\nI think there might be misprint:\nMaybe it is: k12 = k8 \u00d7 (12) - 5, so then compute: k8= ?; maybe k8 is actually not 28? Wait re-read the text:\n\nThe prompt: \n\"OBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\"\n\nThen \"CHECK:\" list items:\n1. k7= ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8= ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9= ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11= ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12= ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo they claim that for key 12, using the formula f(n)*n+g(n), dividing by n gives non integer result if we assume that pattern f(12) would be computed as 2683 / 12 ~ 223.58333. But then note: \"k8\u00d712-5=2683\". Since k8 was given as 28, then 28*12 -5 = 336 -5 =331. So not matching 2683.\n\nWait check: 28 \u00d7 12 - 5 equals 336 - 5 = 331, but they say \"k8\u00d712-5=2683\". That doesn't compute: 28 * 12 is 336, subtract 5 equals 331. So maybe k8 is not 28? Wait re-read check number 2: It says: \n\"2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\"\nThis implies that when you divide the key's value by index, you get f(n). For n=8, we got 224/8=28, so f(8)=28. Then check number 5: \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". Now, if I apply the formula from the observed rule for index 12: maybe it's like k12 = (f(8) \u00d7 12) -5, so f(8)=28 then that gives 28*12-5=336-5=331, not matching 2683. So something is off.\n\nI suspect there is a misinterpretation: Possibly the notation \"k8\" in the expression \"k8\u00d712-5\" is actually the key number itself, i.e. k_8 = ? maybe \"k8\" stands for the value of key index 8? But then they denote that as f(8)*n + g(n)? Alternatively, maybe I'm reading wrongly: It might be \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 (12 -5)\". That is ambiguous.\n\nWait, the observed pattern:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\n\nThat suggests that sometimes index n appears in the formula. And then they check with division by n yields f(n). For key 8, dividing value by index gives an integer: 224/8=28.\nFor key 11, dividing by 11 gives 1155/11=105.\n\nSo for keys where the pattern holds, we have k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) with f(n)= some known values. They computed for n=7: f(7)=76/7 which is not an integer. For n=9: f(9)=467/9 not an integer.\nFor n=12: f(12)=2683/12 which is not an integer, but if we use the observed pattern with k8? Perhaps there's a correction factor that sometimes involves previous key values.\n\nMaybe the question asks: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\" That means given keys k7=76, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, and k12=2683, we should compute what is f(7)=? f(8)=?, etc.\n\nFor key 7: They computed 76/7 = 10.857... So not integer.\nFor key 8: 224/8=28 exactly.\nFor key 9: 467/9 \u2248 51.8889, so not an integer.\nFor key 11: 1155/11=105 exactly.\nFor key 12: 2683/12 \u2248 223.58333.\n\nBut then the observed pattern \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" would imply that k12 should equal (k8)*12 - 5, and since k8 is given as 224? Wait, maybe I misread: \"2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\". This suggests that the key with index 8 is computed by multiplying 28 by 8 and then adding something. But it's already an integer division.\n\nMaybe I'll try to see if there's a pattern: Perhaps f(n) for each n is some function of n: For n=7, f(7)=? maybe 10; for n=8, f(8)=28; for n=9, f(9)=52 (if rounding? because 467/9 \u2248 51.8889, which might round to 52); for n=11, f(11)=105; for n=12, f(12) would be maybe 224? Because k8\u00d712 -5 = 224*12-5=2688-5=2683 exactly, so then that formula gives f(8)*n + g(n)? Wait, if we assume pattern: For n=12, the observed relation is: k12 = k8 * (something) but \"k8\u00d712 - 5\" suggests that we take the key for index 8 and multiply by index 12 then subtract 5. So maybe f(8)=224? But no, they already computed k8 as 224.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps k8 in \"k8 \u00d7 12 -5\" means \"the eighth prime\"? That seems unlikely.\n\nWait a minute, re-read: \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\"\nMaybe the intended meaning is that when computing key 12's value, you multiply the previous key with index equal to a factor that depends on index 12. But then the check says:\n\"CHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\nSo they check for each key whether it can be expressed as f(n)*n + g(n), where division by n gives an integer f(n). For keys 7 and 9, it's not clean (noninteger result) but for keys 8 and 11, it works. And then for key12, while the naive division doesn't give an integer, if we use k8 (which is computed from a previous key) times 12 and subtract 5, we get exactly 2683.\n\nSo perhaps there's a pattern: sometimes k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) where f(n)=? But then what is the question: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" It might be that we need to compute f(7), f(8), f(9), f(11), and f(12) as given by these expressions.\n\nFor k7, they computed 76/7 which equals 10.8571... That is not an integer. For k8: it's exactly 28.\nFor k9: it's about 51.8889.\nFor k11: it's exactly 105.\nFor k12: as we know, if you use the formula from observed pattern k12 = k8 * 12 -5, then that equals 224*? Wait check:\nk8 is given as 224/8? No I must re-read: \"2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8\" That means the value of key8 is 224; so f(8) = 224 / 8 = 28.\n\nThen \"4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\" So key 11 equals 1155, and f(11)=1155/11=105.\nNow \"5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\" \nThis implies that if we compute k8*12 - 5 = 224? Wait, what is the value of k8? It's given as 224 in check 2. So then 224 * 12 = 2688; subtracting 5 gives 2683 which equals key 12.\nSo for key 12, if we try to express it in form f(12)*12 + g(12), then the quotient is not an integer: f(12) would be (k12 - something)/12? Let's see. If we set f(12)= k8 from check2? That doesn't hold because k8=224 but 224*12 = 2688 which is too high. So maybe g(12) is negative in that case: specifically, if we set f(12)=k8 then k12 would be 224*12 + something, but here it's 2683, so the additive constant would be -5.\nThus for key 12, f(n)=? But then pattern suggests sometimes index n appears. Possibly g(n) is not always zero.\n\nMaybe we have to derive general formulas: Given keys:\nk7 = 76\nk8 = 224\nk9 = 467\nk11 = 1155\nk12 = 2683\n\nWe want f(n)=? Perhaps we can try to guess a pattern in f(n) for those n where division gives an integer, i.e. n=8 and n=11.\nFor n=8, f(8)=28; for n=11, f(11)=105.\n\nMaybe there is sequence: 28 and 105. The ratio 105/28 =3.75 maybe? Possibly the pattern is f(n) = something like (n-1 choose 2)? Let's try: For n=8, (7 choose 2) equals 21; no.\nOr maybe it's triangular numbers? 28 is a tetrahedral number? Actually, 28 is the 4th tetrahedral number. And 105 is the 5th tetrahedral number? Check: Tetrahedral numbers: T(1)=1, T(2)=4, T(3)=10, T(4)=20, T(5)=35, so that's not it.\n\nWait 28 is a well-known number as triangular number (7*8/2=28). And 105 = triangular number for n=14? Actually, 105 is the 14th triangular number: 105 = 15 choose 2? No, triangular numbers: T(n)=n(n+1)/2. For T(7)=28 and T(10)=55, not sure.\n\nMaybe f(8) = 28 which is T(7)? And f(11)=105 which equals T(14)/? Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(n) = (n-1 choose something). Actually, 28 = C(8,2)? Because C(8,2)=28 indeed. Similarly, 105 = C(11,2)? But C(11,2) = 55, not 105. Wait, C(11,3)=165 maybe? Let's check: C(8,2)=28; what about 11? Possibly f(n)=C(n+1, ?). For n=11, maybe 105 equals C(14,?) Let me try: C(14,2) =91, C(14,3)=364, no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(n)= (n+1 choose something). For n=8, if we want f(8)=28 then maybe it's C(8,2)? And for n=11, 105 equals C(11,? ) Possibly C(11,3)=165, too high; C(11,4)=330.\n\nMaybe there is pattern: f(7) would be 76/7 = 10.857... but if we try to round that to nearest integer maybe 11? And for n=9, 467/9 \u224851.8889, which might round to 52. Then the pattern could be: f(7)=11, f(8)=28, f(9)=52, f(11)=105, f(12)=223 (if we subtract 5 and then divide by 12, we get 2683/12 =223.5833, so maybe rounding to 224 but that doesn't work). Let's check: For n=8, k8=224 is exactly divisible by 8 giving 28; for n=11, 1155/11=105 exactly; for n=7 and n=9, the division yields non-integers. For n=12, if we try to force it into the form f(12)*12 + something =2683, maybe f(12)=224? But then remainder would be -5, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe we need to look at the differences: k7=76, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, k12=2683. Differences:\nk8 - k7 = 148\nk9 - k8 = 243\nThen jump from k9 (n=9) to k11 (n=11): difference is 1155-467=688 over two steps? Not sure.\n\nMaybe these keys come from a known sequence: Possibly they are related to the number of regions in something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to compute f(n)=k_n/n if possible. That gives:\nf(7) = 76/7 = 10.8571...\nf(8) = 224/8 = 28 exactly.\nf(9) = 467/9 \u2248 51.8889\nf(11) = 1155/11 = 105 exactly.\nFor n=12, if we assume pattern k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then maybe for these keys the integer part of division is the same as some previous key's f value? Notice that f(8)=28 and in k12 they used k8*12 -5. That suggests that maybe sometimes f(n) equals f(m) for a smaller m, but multiplied by n?\n\nSpecifically, k12 = 224 * 12 - 5 = (k8)*12 -5.\nMaybe more generally: if n is composite or something, then k_n might equal k_d * n + something? For instance, k11=1155; can we express that in terms of a previous f? 1155/11 =105. And 105 equals? Maybe 7*15? I'm trying to see a pattern.\n\nLet me re-read the question: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\" It might be asking: For which keys does this representation yield an integer value of f(n), and what is that f(n)?\n\nGiven the checks:\nFor n=7, 76/7 = 10.8571 (not integer)\nFor n=8, 224/8 = 28 (integer)\nFor n=9, 467/9 \u2248 51.8889 (not integer)\nFor n=11, 1155/11 = 105 (integer)\nFor n=12, 2683/12 = 223.5833 (not integer) but if we use the observed pattern for n=12, it's k8*12 -5, which implies f(8)=224? That doesn't align.\n\nMaybe we try to find a relation: For key 11, maybe there is a relation with key 7 because 7+4=11, and for key 12, maybe there's a relation with key 8. Possibly the pattern is that sometimes k_n = k_(n-?)* something plus a constant.\n\nI see \"k8\" appears in the formula for k12: k12 = k8*12 -5.\nMaybe similarly k11 could be expressed in terms of k7: k11 = ? Maybe 76*? No, 76*? doesn't match 1155.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we are supposed to identify that sometimes f(n) equals the nth triangular number or something. For n=8, f(8)=28 which is a triangular number (the 7th triangular number). For n=11, f(11)=105 which is also a triangular number? Which triangular numbers: T(1)=1, T(2)=3, T(3)=6, T(4)=10, T(5)=15, T(6)=21, T(7)=28, T(8)=36, T(9)=45, T(10)=55, T(11)=66, T(12)=78, T(13)=91, T(14)=105. Yes! 105 is the 14th triangular number (T(14)=105). And for n=7, f(7) would be about 76/7 \u224810.857 which might correspond to a triangular number? The nearest triangular numbers: T(4)=10, T(5)=15. So 10.857 is closer to 11 maybe.\nFor n=9, f(9)=467/9 \u224851.8889, the closest triangular numbers: T(10)=55 and T(9)=45; 51.89 is between them, but not exactly triangular number.\nMaybe for those keys where it works out cleanly (n=8 and n=11), f(n) equals a triangular number: For n=8, f(8)=28 = T(7); for n=11, f(11)=105 = T(14). And notice 7+? Actually 8 -> 7, 11 -> 14. That doesn't look consistent.\n\nWait maybe f(n) corresponds to a prime-indexed triangular number. For n=2: maybe f(2)=? But we don't have key2 value.\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is not about triangular numbers after all.\n\nMaybe we consider the possibility that for some keys, k_n can be written as f(n)*n + g(n) with integer f(n). And then the question \"Calculate f(n)\" means: For each key n in {7,8,9,11,12}, what is f(n)= floor(k_n/n)? That would give:\nFor n=7, f(7)=10 (if we take integer part)\nFor n=8, f(8)=28\nFor n=9, f(9)=51 (if we take floor) because 467/9 = 51.888...\nFor n=11, f(11)=105 exactly.\nFor n=12, f(12)=223 if we floor? Because 2683/12 = 223 remainder something.\n\nBut then why mention k8\u00d712-5 for key12? That equals 224*12 -5 = 2688-5 = 2683. And note that 224 is exactly one more than the floor of 2683/12 which would be 223 (because 223*12=2676, remainder 7, not matching though). Let's check: 2683/12 = 223.5833, so if you round up to nearest integer, you get 224. And indeed k8 was 224 in check2. So maybe the pattern is that sometimes f(n) equals some previous key divided by its index? For n=12, we have f(12)=k8? Because then k12 would equal k8*12 + g(12), and if g(12) = -5, then f(12)=224. But then 224 is not equal to floor(2683/12). Let's check: 224 * 12 = 2688, subtract 5 equals 2683, so that fits perfectly.\n\nSo maybe the answer is: \nFor n=7, k_7 = 76 = 10.8571*7 + remainder (or not expressible as integer multiple of 7).\nFor n=8, k_8 = 224 = 28 * 8.\nFor n=9, k_9 = 467 = 51.8889*9, so f(9)=51 if we take floor? But then remainder is 467 - 459 = 8.\nFor n=11, k_11 = 1155 = 105 * 11 exactly.\nFor n=12, k_12 = 2683 = 224 * 12 - 5.\n\nSo maybe the answer: f(7) is not an integer; f(8)=28; f(9)=51 (if we round down); f(11)=105; and in the case of key 12, if you use k8 then f(12) becomes 224, but that representation yields a remainder of -5. So maybe the answer: \nFor n=7, no integer f exists;\nn=8: f = 28;\nn=9: f = 51 (with remainder 8);\nn=11: f = 105; and\nn=12: f = 224 if expressed in terms of k_8, but normally f(12)=223 with remainder 7.\n\nI need to re-read the original phrasing: \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" likely means that for each key n (like a piano key), the number k_n is given by some quadratic or something? And they want to see if it factors as f(n)*n + g(n).\n\nMaybe there's an intended pattern: k_n = (some function of n)/n * n + (something). Possibly f(n) equals the sum of the divisors of n, or maybe the number of notes in a scale.\n\nI recall a common puzzle: \"The piano keys and their numbers\" sometimes refer to the fact that there are 88 keys on a piano. And each key might be assigned a number k_n = some quadratic polynomial? There's an old puzzle about \"How many ways can you play a melody?\" but not sure.\n\nWait, maybe this is about \"the number of pieces of information\" or a \"piano roll\" algorithm? Alternatively, could it be that the keys are labeled with numbers like 1 to something and they want to express them in the form f(n)*n + g(n) where f(n) might represent the quotient when dividing k_n by n, and g(n) is the remainder. And maybe there's a pattern: sometimes f(n) equals a prime number or equals something like that.\n\nLet me check: If k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then for each key, f(n) = floor(k_n/n)? But then which keys? Possibly n=2,3,4,... etc. But the given ones are 7,8,9,11,12. They might be a sample.\n\nMaybe I should try to derive a formula for k_n from a known pattern of piano key numbering. There is something called \"the chromatic scale\" where intervals are semitones and sometimes one gets a quadratic sequence.\n\nThere's also the possibility that k_n counts something like the number of notes reachable with n keys, and it satisfies a recurrence relation whose solution is quadratic in n. Then writing it as f(n)*n + g(n) might separate the linear part from the constant offset.\n\nI think I'll assume that the intended answer is to show that for many keys, the quotient when dividing k_n by n gives a pattern: For key 8 and key 11, you get an integer; for key 12, you can express it in terms of key 8's f-value. Possibly the answer is:\n\nFor key 7: f(7) = \u230a76/7\u230b = 10 (remainder 6).\nFor key 8: f(8)=28 exactly.\nFor key 9: f(9)=51 (since 51*9=459, remainder 8).\nFor key 11: f(11)=105 exactly.\nFor key 12: f(12) can be represented as k_8 + something? Actually 2683/12 = 223.5833, so if you round to the nearest integer, you get 224, but that doesn't multiply evenly since 224*12=2688.\n\nWait maybe I should solve for f(n) in a different way: Maybe the intended formula is k_n = (n-1)(n+2)/? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from \"Proofs that Really Count\" or similar. Let me try to see if these numbers might be binomial coefficients. 76, 224, 467, 1155, 2683... They remind me of central binomial coefficients or something like that.\n\nCheck: C(14,2)=91; not matching.\nMaybe they are in the Fibonacci sequence? No.\n\nI think I'll assume that k_n is given and we want to see if it factors as f(n)*n + g(n) where f(n) = floor(k_n/n). Then:\n\nFor n=7: k_7 = 76, so 76/7 \u224810.857, thus f(7)=10 with remainder 6.\nFor n=8: k_8 =224, and 224/8=28 exactly, so f(8)=28.\nFor n=9: 467/9 \u224851.888..., so f(9)=51 (remainder 8).\nFor n=11: 1155/11=105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\nFor n=12: 2683/12 \u2248223.5833, so f(12)=223 with remainder 7, or if rounding to nearest integer then 224 gives a negative remainder.\n\nBut note the remark \"k8\u00d712 -5\" implies that k12 can be written as (k8)*12 -5, which means 2683 = 224*12 -5. Then dividing by 12 gives 224 - 5/12, so if we define f(12)=224 then g(12) = -5.\n\nSo it seems the pattern is not consistent: sometimes f(n) equals k_n/n and sometimes f(n) equals a previous key's full value. \n\nMaybe the intended answer: \"For n=7, 8, 9, 11, and 12, we have:\nk_7 = 10\u00d77 + 6,\nk_8 = 28\u00d78 + 0,\nk_9 = 51\u00d79 + 8,\nk_11 = 105\u00d711 + 0,\nand k_12 = 224\u00d712 -5.\nThus, f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and in the representation of k_12 we can take f(12)=224.\"\n\nI worry that this is not satisfying.\n\nMaybe there's another interpretation: \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" might refer to a function that gives you the number of pieces played on that key when doing something like \"f(n)=n choose 2\", etc. Possibly f(n) = (n^3 - n)/6? Because then for n=8, that equals (512-8)/6=504/6=84, not 28 though.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers correspond to the number of regions determined by chords in a circle or something like that.\n\nI recall a classic result: \"If you have n points on a circle no three collinear, then the number of regions is given by k_n = 1 + C(n,2) + C(n,4).\" For n=7, this equals 1+21+35=57 (not 76). For n=8, that gives 1+28+70=99; not matching.\nMaybe it's the number of regions in a circle with chords connecting points: Actually, formula is R = C(n^4 -6C(n,2)+ something)...\n\nWait, maybe these numbers are from a different combinatorial object.\n\nGiven the context \"for each key\", I suspect it might be about a piano keyboard and its numbering scheme. There's a known puzzle: \"Find the missing number in this sequence: 76, 224, 467, 1155, ...\" It might come from some formula like k_n = (n^3 + 2)/? Not sure.\n\nI need to re-read the question carefully: The user said \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" with no further context. Possibly I should ask clarifying questions.\n\nSince there is not enough context in the provided query, I'll ask: \"Could you please provide more details or context?\" \n\nBut instructions say: \"Don't ask clarifying questions if possible.\"\n\nGiven that the user said only \"Calculate f(n) for each key\", it might be referencing a known result from some source. Perhaps I should check if this is related to the piano keys and their numbering in the work of Ramanujan or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about expressing k_n as n * f(n) + g(n), where f(n) is the quotient when dividing k_n by n, and g(n) is the remainder. Then for each key (n value provided), we have:\nFor key 7: f(7) = floor(76/7) = 10.\nFor key 8: f(8) = 224/8 = 28.\nFor key 9: f(9) = floor(467/9) = 51 (with remainder 8).\nFor key 11: f(11)=1155/11=105.\nFor key 12: If we use the representation k_12 = k_8*12 - 5, then f(12)=k_8=224.\n\nThat seems to be the only plausible answer given the provided expressions \"k8\u00d712 - 5\" suggests using key 8's value in key 12. So likely:\nf(7)=10,\nf(8)=28,\nf(9)=51,\nf(11)=105,\nand f(12)=224.\n\nI'll now provide an answer explaining: Given the representation k_n = n*f(n) + g(n), we can solve for f(n) by dividing k_n by n (or using known expressions). For key 7, since 76 divided by 7 gives quotient 10 with remainder 6, so f(7)=10. For key 8, 224/8=28 exactly, so f(8)=28. For key 9, 467/9 gives a non-integer; if we take the integer part, f(9)=51 (since 51*9=459 and remainder is 8). For key 11, 1155/11=105 exactly, so f(11)=105. And for key 12, note that k_12 can be written as 224\u00d712 -5, which implies f(12)=224.\n\nI'll now check: 224*12 = 2688, subtract 5 gives 2683, yes.\n\nSo answer: \nKey 7: f(7)=10,\nKey 8: f(8)=28,\nKey 9: f(9)=51,\nKey 11: f(11)=105,\nKey 12: f(12)=224.\n\nI will now produce a final answer message.</think>One acceptable way to \u201cdecompose\u201d the number k\u2099 (which is assigned to the nth key) is to write\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = n\u00b7f(n) + g(n).\n\nIn other words, if you divide k\u2099 by n you get a quotient f(n) and a remainder g(n).
