Let's read the question carefully:\n\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n\nIs there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)?\n\nCalculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nWe are asked: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" And we have keys like: apparently keys: k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, and maybe others. But the question is not complete in details? Let's try to deduce what pattern might be.\n\nObserving provided info:\n- k2, k3 appear somewhere. Observed: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\", but then text: (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no). Possibly it means that for some key number there's a product formula that involves the index itself.\n\nWe have check items:\n\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 computed as 76/7 gives approx 10.86 (not integer)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 computed as 224/8 = 28, so f(8)=? Possibly the quotient? Wait: \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" then they compute 224/8 = 28 = k8/8, so maybe f(8) equals 28.\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 computed as 467/9 \u224851.89 (not integer)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 computed as 1155/11=105, which is an integer\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 computed as 2683/12\u2248223.58 but then they mention \"k8\u00d712-5=2683\" so that yields a relation: k12 = (28\u00d712)-5\n\nThen conclusion: So we have found:\n\nk8 = 28 * 8, and k11 = 105*11.\n\nSo apparently there's pattern of form:\nk_n = f(n)* n + g(n) maybe.\nAnd they check division by index yields either integer or not.\n\nMaybe the hypothesis is that sometimes f(n)= (some function) when dividing k_n / n gives an integer. But in some cases, like k7 and k9 do not yield an integer quotient from dividing by 7 or 9 respectively.\n\nLet's try to analyze further: Possibly we have some sequence of \"k\" keys maybe associated with prime numbers? Wait \"index product pattern analysis\" could be a known puzzle sometimes seen in puzzles where you have a series of equations like k2, k3, etc.\n\nMaybe the question is about pattern of a function f(n) that, when multiplied by n and then added to g(n), gives k_n. The observed pattern: for some indices (like 8 and 11) it works nicely; maybe others don't? But the question asks: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So perhaps we need to compute f(2), f(3), f(5), f(7), f(8), etc. Possibly using information from formulas like k5 = k2 * k3, and k12 = k8*12 - 5. Wait: k12 is described as \"k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" equals 2683. That means if we let k8=224, then f(8)=? Actually check: The text says \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713\", so that might imply that if you divide k8 by 8, you get 28. So f(8) is likely 28 if g(8)=0 in the formula? But then they claim \"k11 = 105 \u00d7 11\" so that implies for n=11, dividing gives 1155 / 11 =105. And then k12, we computed 2683/12 is not an integer, but then they note that it equals (28\u00d712)-5. That suggests maybe f(12) would be 28 and g(12) = -5.\n\nWait a minute: The question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" might refer to keys: k2, k3, k4, etc. But we only have partial info in the question.\n\nLet's re-read the original message:\n\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n\nIs there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)?\n\nCalculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nWait, what is the sequence? Possibly we have keys: k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. But then they mention \"k5 = k2\u00d7k3\", and \"k12 = k8*12 - 5\" and check with others. So maybe the list of keys is like: for n=2, k2; n=3, k3; n=5, k5; n=7, k7; n=8, k8; n=9, k9; n=11, k11; n=12, k12. And maybe also others.\n\nThe check numbers: For k7, they computed 76/7 = approx 10.86, so that doesn't yield a neat factor of 7? Similarly for k9: 467/9 \u224851.89.\nFor k8, we got an integer quotient: 224/8=28, so that's neat. For k11, 1155/11=105 is neat.\n\nSo maybe f(n) equals (k_n)/n when the division gives an integer? But then what about others? It might be something like:\n- f(2)? Possibly from another formula?\n- The text \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" suggests that if we know f(2), f(3) then maybe f(5)=? But not sure.\n\nMaybe the pattern is: sometimes, k_n can be expressed as (f(n)*n + g(n)) where sometimes f(n) is given by a multiplication rule from earlier indices. For example, \"k12 = k8*12 - 5\" gives that for n=12, maybe f(12)= k8? But then they computed: k8 = 224, and multiplied by 12 gives 2688, minus 5 equals 2683.\n\nSo if we write in the form:\nk_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then for n=12,\nf(12) would be what factor? It's not simply 28 because k8/?? Actually no. Wait: They state \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\" That means that sometimes, when you divide k_n by n, you get an integer f(n). For instance, for n=8 and n=11.\nMaybe then f(2) might be computed from some relation with others.\n\nI suspect this is part of a puzzle about keys (like \"k\" stands for \"key\", maybe in cryptography or something similar), and the pattern is: k_n = ? \u00d7 n + ?. And they want us to find f(n).\n\nGiven we only know:\n- k8/8=28, so f(8)=28.\n- k11/11=105, so f(11)=105.\n- k12 can be written as 28*12 -5. But that doesn't match the pattern k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) because then f(12)=28 and g(12)=-5.\n\nMaybe we want to compute: \nFor n=7, maybe if we assume a similar structure f(7)*7+g(7), but 76/7 is not integer. So f(7) might be the floor of that division? But it says \"not clean\", so perhaps for n=7, there's no simple pattern.\n\nWait: Let\u2019s try to see if maybe these keys come from a known sequence like the \"K\" values in \"Key-Product Puzzle\". There is a puzzle where you have keys with numbers, and they satisfy certain multiplicative properties. I recall something about product of two keys equals another key. Possibly it's similar to this: k2 * k3 = k5 (observed) but then k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5.\nMaybe the keys are: \nk1? Not given.\nWe have: k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12 maybe.\n\nI suspect that we might need to assume some structure like f(n) is the product of two primes or something.\n\nAlternatively, the question might be incomplete. Possibly I'll need to assume that keys are given by: k_n = (sum_{d|n} something)? Not sure.\n\nLet's re-read the text carefully:\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\"\n\nIt says \"Observed:\" then bullet points:\n\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n\nThis might be read as: the index 5 is obtained by multiplying indices 2 and 3? But that doesn't hold because 2*3=6 not 5. Alternatively maybe it's like this: The key for 5 equals the product of keys for 2 and 3, but then they note (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no) might mean that the indices multiply to 6, which is close to 5 maybe? No.\n\nNext bullet:\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nSo here it's clear: k12 equals 12 times something minus 5. That formula has the index 12 explicitly.\nThen they list check points:\n\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7=10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8=28= k8/8 \u2713\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9=51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11=105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12=223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo from those, the ones that are \"clean\" (i.e., integer quotient when divided by n) are for n=8 and n=11.\nThus maybe f(8)=28, and f(11)=105.\n\nNow they conclude: So k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711.\n\nThen the question: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nMaybe we are supposed to calculate f(n) for keys that are \"clean\", meaning when k_n is divisible by n? In which case, for n=8 and 11, f(8)=28 and f(11)=105. What about others: For n=2,3,5,7,9,12? Possibly we can compute them if we had the actual values of k_n. But we do have some values: For n=7, they gave k7 = 76; for n=8, k8=224; for n=9, k9=467; for n=11, k11=1155; for n=12, k12=2683. And there is also the relation: k2 and k3 are involved in k5.\n\nWe know: k5 = k2 * k3.\nBut what are k2 and k3 values? They haven't been given directly but maybe we can deduce them from known keys?\nMaybe they are part of a system where each key is defined by an index? Perhaps the function f(n) might be something like: for prime n, maybe f(n)= (n^3 - ...)? Let's try to see if there is any pattern among these numbers.\n\nWe have:\nk7 = 76\nk8 = 224\nk9 = 467\nk11 = 1155\nk12 = 2683\n\nAlso we know: k2, k3 are involved in forming k5. And k5 equals k2*k3.\nWhat is k5? Not given explicitly but maybe can be deduced from f(5)? If pattern holds for all keys then k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). For n=7, 76 = f(7)*7 + g(7). But we don't know if g(7) might be constant or something.\n\nMaybe the hypothesis \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula\" means that sometimes the value of n (the index) is used as a multiplier for one of the terms in the expression for k_n. For instance, k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 -5 indicates that for n=12, f(12)=k8? But then they wrote it as: k12 = ?\u00d712+? and that didn't yield an integer when dividing by 12 (since 2683/12 is not integer) but if we express it as k12 = 28\u00d712 -5, then f(12)=28 which equals k8/8.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is: for some keys n, f(n) equals k_(n/2)? For n=12, that gives f(12)=k8? But k8 we computed as 224/8 =28, so yes.\n\nFor n=11, they got f(11)=1155/11=105. How might that be related to earlier indices? Possibly f(11) equals k_(11-?)?\nMaybe there's a relation: f(n) for some keys are the values of other keys divided by something.\nWe see f(8)=28 and f(12)=28, so maybe f(8) = f(12)? But 8 and 12 share factor 4. And also k11=105. Maybe f(11)=? Not sure.\n\nI hypothesize that the pattern might be: f(n) equals (k_(n')/?) where n' is some divisor of n or something.\n\nWait, let's try to extract potential formulas from given relations:\n\nWe have two explicit formula-like relations:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. So maybe there is a multiplicative relation for composite indices.\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5, which can be written as: k12 = (k8)\u00d7(n) - constant.\n\nSo possibly the general pattern could be: For some key n, k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), where f(n) might come from a previous key. And maybe there is a relation connecting different indices.\n\nMaybe we can try to solve for f(2), f(3) and so on if we assume that the pattern holds consistently.\n\nWe know: k5 = k2 * k3.\nAlso, we have values for k7=76, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, k12=2683. What about k2, k3? They are likely small numbers. Possibly the keys are arranged in increasing order by index: k1, k2, k3, ...\nOften puzzles like these have the property that each key equals the sum of two previous keys or something.\nMaybe we can try to guess: If k7=76 and k8=224, then maybe f(7) is not integer when dividing 76/7. But maybe f(2), f(3) are chosen such that k5 = k2 * k3 becomes consistent with some pattern.\n\nGiven the structure \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\", we might assume that for prime indices, the expression simplifies to an integer quotient if there is no remainder. For composite indices, it might not.\nFor n=8 (which is composite), 224/8=28 which is an integer.\nFor n=11 (prime), 1155/11=105 which is an integer.\n\nMaybe we can try to see the differences:\nk7 = 76\nk8 = 224 => difference 148, which is 8*18.5? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these keys are defined recursively by: k_n = n^3 - something.\nCheck: 2^3=8 but maybe k2 could be 13? 3^3=27? Possibly not.\n\nLet's try to see if the numbers we have (76,224,467,1155,2683) relate to known sequences. 1155 factors as 3*5*7*11, interestingly. And 224 is 32*7, and 2683 is prime maybe? 2683/19=141.21 no.\nMaybe 224 = 8^3 - 0 ? Because 8^3=512, too high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the keys are defined by: k_n = (n+1)^3 - something.\nFor n=7, (7+1)^3=512, not close to 76.\n\nMaybe they follow a polynomial pattern. Let's try differences:\nk7=76, k8=224, difference=148.\nk9=467, difference from 224 is 243, and then k11 - k9 =1155-467=688, and k12-k11=2683-1155=1528.\n\nThese differences: 148, 243, 688, 1528 don't look like simple multiples of indices.\n\nMaybe we can express f(n) in terms of known values. For n=8, f(8)=224/8=28.\nFor n=11, f(11)=1155/11=105.\nFor n=12, if we force the form k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then f(12)=? But 2683 is not divisible by 12. But they also expressed it as 28*12 -5, so that means f(12) could be taken to be 28 and g(12)=-5.\nFor n=7, if we express it as f(7)*7+g(7)=76, then f(7) would be floor(76/7)=10 remainder 6. But 10 is not 105, but maybe there's a pattern: f(8)=28 and f(11)=105 and f(12)=28 again.\nThe factor 28 appears in both k8 and k12. And 105 appears for k11.\n\nMaybe we can guess that f(n) equals the key value of some divisor of n? For example, for n=12, its proper divisor 8 is used: f(12)=k8/8 =224/8=28.\nFor n=11 (prime), maybe f(11) equals k2 * something? But k2 we haven't computed.\n\nMaybe there's a relation: k_n = [ (n - some constant)/?] I see 105 for n=11 and 28 for n=8. 105/28 is not an integer though, it's 3.75.\nOr maybe f(n) equals the sum of digits of something?\n\nI recall a puzzle called \"Key Lock Puzzle\" where keys are assigned to numbers with certain multiplicative properties. Possibly the intended answer: \nFor index 2: f(2)=? For index 3: f(3)=? For index 5: f(5) = ? etc.\n\nMaybe we assume that the formula holds for all n, and we want to compute f(n) as k_n div n if it divides evenly. So then:\nf(7) would be floor(76/7)=10 with remainder 6.\nBut maybe \"clean\" means exactly divisible without remainder. So f(8)=28 (because 224/8=28 exactly), and f(11)=105, but for others we get non-integers.\n\nMaybe the pattern is: if n is prime, then k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) with no extra term? But for n=7, 76/7 = 10.857..., not an integer.\nUnless we reinterpret \"clean\" as meaning that when you try to write it in the form f(n)*n + g(n), sometimes the quotient f(n) is an integer and sometimes it's not; but then the question asks: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So perhaps we are supposed to compute the quotient of k_n divided by n, even if it's non-integer? But then that would give:\nf(7)=76/7=10.857... (approx 10.857), f(9)=467/9 \u224851.888..., f(12)=2683/12 \u2248223.583...\nBut then for n=8, it gives exactly 28 and for n=11, it gives exactly 105.\nThat doesn't seem patterned.\n\nMaybe instead the intended interpretation is: k_n can be expressed in the form f(n)*n + g(n) where f(n) might sometimes equal a previous key. For instance, they showed that k12 = 28*12 -5, and noted that 28 came from k8/8.\nMaybe then for n=11, we might express it as something like: k11 = ? * 11 + ? and the \"?\" in front of 11 is f(11) which is 105. And maybe for n=7, k7 would be expressed similarly but it's not as \"nice\".\nI think the answer expected is:\nf(2)=?; f(3)=?; f(5)=?; f(7)=10.857...? That doesn't look nice.\n\nMaybe I'm supposed to derive a formula for f(n) in terms of the index n. The ones that \"work\" are 8 and 11, where k_n is divisible by n. Perhaps there's a recurrence relation: k_(n+1) = (f(n)*n + g(n)) * something.\n\nThe text \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula\" might mean that sometimes we see an expression like: k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 -5, where the factor 12 is the index. So maybe in general for composite n, we have k_n = k_(n/2) * n + constant, if n is even and divisible by something.\nFor n=12, 12/4=3? No.\n\nAlternatively, could it be that f(n) equals the key with index equal to a prime factor of n? For instance, for n=12, its factors are 2,3,4,6, etc. But k8 is used in k12. And note: 8 is not a divisor of 12. But 12/8 is not an integer either.\n\nWait, reconsider: They wrote \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\". That might indicate that the index 5 factors as 2 and 3. For n=12, you could factor it as 2*6 or 3*4. And they used k8 in the expression for k12, but 8 is not a factor of 12 either.\n\nMaybe it's: k_n = k_(n - something) \u00d7 n + constant.\nFor n=12, maybe n-? equals 5? Because then k5 appears sometimes?\nk5 = k2*k3. So perhaps f(12)=f(5)? But no, f(5) is not computed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should assume that the keys are defined by a formula: k_n = (n^3 + n)/? No, 7 gives 76 which is close to 343/4=85.75.\n\nLet\u2019s try to see if there's any polynomial relation:\nAssume k(n) = An^2 + Bn + C.\nFor n=7: A*49+7B+C=76.\nFor n=8: A*64+8B+C=224.\nFor n=9: A*81+9B+C=467.\nWe have three equations:\n49A + 7B + C = 76   (1)\n64A + 8B + C = 224  (2)\n81A + 9B + C = 467  (3)\n\nSubtract (1) from (2): 15A + B = 148. So B = 148 -15A.\nSubtract (2) from (3): 17A + B = 243, so substitute: 17A + (148-15A)=243 => 2A=95 => A=47.5\nThen B = 148 -15*47.5 =148 -712.5= -564.5.\nThen C from (1): 49*47.5 +7*(-564.5)+C=76, 2327.5 -3951.5 + C=76, so C =76+1624=1700.\nSo k(n)=47.5n^2 -564.5 n +1700.\nCheck for n=11: 47.5*121 -564.5*11+1700 =5747.5 -6210+1700 =1237.5, not 1155.\nSo quadratic doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe cubic? But then we have too many unknowns.\n\nMaybe the intended answer is simply to observe that for some keys, when you divide by the index, you get a whole number f(n). And those values are: \nf(2) = ?; f(3)= ?; f(5)=?; f(7)= ?; f(8)=28; f(9)=?; f(11)=105; f(12)=28 (if we take the decomposition k12=28*12 -5).\n\nMaybe then f(n) equals: \nFor n prime, f(n) = (n^3 + 2)/? Not sure.\n\nI think I might need to re-read the prompt: \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula\" and then they give examples: k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3, and k12 = 28\u00d712 - 5. It seems like there is a pattern where sometimes the index n multiplies one of the previous keys.\n\nMaybe the intended answer is:\nf(1) = something,\nf(2)= ?,\n...\nBut we only have examples for indices 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12. And they mention k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12.\nWe know: \nk7 = ? is given as \"clean\" or not?\nThey show:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (so f(5) might be something like that but then written in form f(5)*5 + g(5); since 5 does not divide  k2*k3 evenly maybe)\n- k7: they mention nothing special.\n- k8 is clean: k8/8 = 28, so f(8)=28 and g(8)=0.\n- k9: not sure if it's \"clean\". They show k9 =? Possibly expressed as something times 9 plus remainder?\n- k11: clean: k11/11=105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\n- k12: can be written as 28*12 -5, so then f(12)=28 and g(12)=-5.\n\nMaybe the answer is to notice that sometimes the quotient f(n) equals the key for a proper divisor. For example, f(8)=k8/8=28, and f(11)=k11/11=105.\nAlso, k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 implies that if you divide by 5 you might get (k2\u00d7k3)/5, which might be an integer if k2 and k3 have factors of 5.\n\nI suspect the intended answer is something along the lines of:\nFor index 5: f(5) = (k2*k3)/5.\nFor index 8: f(8) = k8/8 = 28.\nFor index 11: f(11) = k11/11 = 105.\nFor index 12: f(12) can be written as 28, since k12 = 28\u00d712 - 5.\n\nBut then what about indices 7 and 9? Possibly they are not \"clean\" because the quotient is not an integer. In that case, we express them in mixed form:\nk7 = f(7)*7 + g(7) with f(7)=10 and remainder 6, so k7=10*7+6.\nSimilarly, k9 might be something like: f(9)=51 with remainder 2, so k9=51*9+2.\n\nLet me check if that fits the idea of \"sometimes the index appears in the formula\": It seems they want to point out that sometimes the coefficient is exactly a previous key value (like 28) and sometimes it's not.\nPerhaps I should state:\nFor n=7, dividing by 7 gives: 76 = 10\u00d77 + 6, so f(7)=10 and g(7)=6.\nFor n=8, 224 = 28\u00d78 + 0, so f(8)=28.\nFor n=9, 467 divided by 9 is not an integer; if we do Euclidean division: 9*51=459 with remainder 8, so f(9)=51 and g(9)=8.\nFor n=11, 1155 = 105\u00d711 + 0, so f(11)=105.\nFor n=12, as given, 2683 = 28\u00d712 - 5; equivalently, 2683 = 27\u00d712 + (12-5) doesn't match. Let's do division: 12*223 = 2676 with remainder 7, but they claim f(12)=28? Wait, recalc k12: They said \"k12=28\u00d712 - 5\" which means k12=336 - 5 =331, not 2683. I must re-read the prompt carefully.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\" Then it gives examples:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3.\n- k7 (maybe) ...\n- k8 is \"clean\" because k8/8=28 exactly.\n- k9 might be like that.\n- k11 is clean with f(11)=105.\n- k12 can be written as 28\u00d712 - 5, so the factor 12 appears.\n\nI need to re-read: \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula\" and then it lists:\nk5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\nk7 = ?\nk8 (clean) means k8/8=28 exactly.\nk9 = ? \nk11 is clean with quotient 105.\nk12 = 28\u00d712 - 5.\n\nI think the intended answer is to notice that in some cases, the coefficient f(n) equals a previous key value. Specifically:\nFor n=8: f(8)=28.\nFor n=11: f(11)=105.\nFor n=12: we can write it as f(12)*12 + g(12) = 28\u00d712 - 5.\n\nMaybe the answer is simply:\nf(7) = 10, f(8) = 28, f(9) = 51, f(11) = 105, and for n=12, if we insist on writing k_n in the form f(n)*n + g(n), then f(12)=28.\n\nHowever, without the full context of the puzzle (likely a key-lock puzzle from the Art of Problem Solving community or something similar) it's hard to be sure. Perhaps I can say:\n\nAnswer: \nWe have:\nk7 = 10\u00d77 + 6,\nk8 = 28\u00d78 + 0,\nk9 = 51\u00d79 + 8,\nk11 = 105\u00d711 + 0, and\nk12 = 28\u00d712 - 5.\n\nThus the f-values are:\nf(7) = 10,\nf(8) = 28,\nf(9) = 51,\nf(11) = 105,\nand for k12 we can take f(12)=28 (though note that k12 also fits with a negative remainder).\n\nBut I'm not confident this is what's being asked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer expected: \"For each key k_n, you can write it in the form k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), where sometimes n appears as a multiplier. For example, k5 can be written as (k2\u00d7k3)/5, and k12 can be expressed as 28*12 - 5. In these cases, we have f(5) = k2*k3/5 and f(12)=28.\"\n\nI need to check consistency: They said \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\" That is, sometimes n divides k_n evenly, so that you can factor out an n from k_n. For instance, for k8 we have 224 = 28\u00d78, and for k11 we have 1155 = 105\u00d711. In these cases, f(8)=28 and f(11)=105.\nBut then they mention k12 can be written as 28\u00d712 - 5. That is not of the form n times something because 28\u00d712 would be too large; it's actually 336, but k12 is 2683? Wait, let me recalc: maybe I misread k12. Possibly k12 = 28*12 + (something) rather than -5.\nThe text \"k12=28\u00d712 - 5\" means k12 equals 28 multiplied by 12 minus 5. That would be 336-5=331, which seems too small compared to the others. Perhaps k8 is not 224 but something else? Let me re-read: \"k7 = ?\" maybe I mis-assigned.\n\nLet's assume the given keys are:\nk2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12.\nAnd they give relationships:\nk5 = k2 \u00d7 k3,\nand then\nf(7)=?; f(8) from k8 is \"clean\", meaning k8/8 is an integer. They show: \"k8=28\u00d78\" so k8 must be 224.\nThen k9, maybe it's not clean because 9 does not divide it evenly, and they want to express it as some quotient times 9 plus remainder.\nThen k11 is clean with f(11)=105 (so k11=1155).\nAnd k12 can be written as 28\u00d712 - 5, so then k12 = 336-5=331.\n\nBut 331 seems inconsistent with the pattern if we assume keys are increasing. They should be in order: k2 < k3 < k5 < k7 < k8 < k9 < k11 < k12, maybe? But 331 is not greater than 1155 if it's after 1155.\n\nMaybe I misinterpret: \"k12=28\u00d712 - 5\" might be read as \"k12 = (28\u00d712) - 5\", and the -5 indicates a slight deviation from being 'clean'. So k12 is almost clean but not quite.\n\nI think the intended pattern is that each key can be written in the form f(n)*n + g(n), and sometimes the multiplier f(n) equals one of the earlier keys. In particular, for n=8 and 11, we have f(8)=28 and f(11)=105. And then they note that k12 can be expressed as 28\u00d712 - 5, so that it is almost \"clean\" but with a slight adjustment.\n\nThus the answer: \nf(7) = (k7 - remainder)/7, but we don't have k7 explicitly.\nMaybe I'll express answers in terms of known keys:\nLet k2 and k3 be given. Then\nk5 = k2 * k3,\nand writing k8 = f(8)*8 + g(8), we find f(8)=28 (since it's \"clean\").\nSimilarly, writing k11 = f(11)*11 + g(11) yields f(11)=105.\nAnd finally, k12 can be written as 28\u00d712 - 5.\n\nWithout additional context or numerical values for the keys aside from these expressions, that might be all.\n\nMaybe I'll answer: \n\nWe can write each key in the form k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), where sometimes n divides k_n evenly. For instance:\n\u2022 k_5 is given by k_2 \u00d7 k_3.\n\u2022 k_8 is \"clean\": since 224 = 28\u00d78, we have f(8) = 28.\n\u2022 Similarly, k_11 is clean: since 1155 = 105\u00d711, we have f(11) = 105.\n\u2022 In the case of k_12, although it's not completely clean, we can write it as k_12 = 28\u00d712 - 5. \n\nSo, the answers for f(n) in these instances are:\nf(8)=28, f(11)=105, and when written as 28\u00d712 - 5, we note that the factor 12 appears explicitly.\n\nThis is likely what is expected.\n\nMaybe I'll also add: For n=7 and n=9, if needed, write k_7 = f(7)*7 + g(7) with appropriate f(7) and remainder, but since they are not \"clean\", the exact values depend on the problem context. \n\nI worry that without the full problem text it's ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intended answer is simply: \nk5 = k2 \u00d7 k3,\nk8 = 28\u00d78,\nk9 = ?,\nk11 = 105\u00d711,\nk12 = 28\u00d712 - 5.\nThus f(8)=28, f(11)=105, and in the expression for k12, the index 12 appears explicitly.\n\nI can answer: \nThe keys expressed in the form k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) are:\n\u2022 k_7 = 10\u00d77 + 6,\n\u2022 k_8 = 28\u00d78 + 0,\n\u2022 k_9 = 51\u00d79 + 8,\n\u2022 k_11 = 105\u00d711 + 0, and\n\u2022 k_12 = 28\u00d712 - 5.\nThus the f-values are: f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and for k_12 we take f(12)=28.\n\nI lean towards this answer if I assume that the keys given in the original problem (likely from an AoPS thread) are exactly those numbers. \n\nHowever, I'm not 100% sure of the values for k7 and k9. They might be deduced by noting that sometimes the index appears explicitly as a factor, so for k8 and k11 it's obvious. For k12, we see 28 reappears which is f(8). Possibly the keys are connected in this puzzle.\n\nI'll provide an answer: \n\nAnswer:\nWe can express each key k_n in the form k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). In particular,\n\u2022 k_7 = 10\u00d77 + 6, so f(7) = 10.\n\u2022 k_8 is \"clean\" because 224 = 28\u00d78, hence f(8)=28.\n\u2022 k_9 = 51\u00d79 + 8, so f(9) = 51.\n\u2022 k_11 is clean since 1155 = 105\u00d711, giving f(11)=105.\n\u2022 k_12 can be written as 28\u00d712 - 5.\nNotice that in k_12 the index 12 appears explicitly, and also f(8)=28 reappears.\n\nThus, the values of f(n) for these keys are: \nf(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, and f(11)=105 (with k_12 expressed in terms of 28\u00d712).\n\nI'll now check arithmetic: 10*7=70; plus 6 gives 76. 28*8 =224; 51*9=459; plus 8 equals 467? But I earlier had 467 vs 467, yes. And 105*11 =1155.\nk_12: 28\u00d712=336 minus 5 equals 331.\n\nThese numbers appear plausible if the keys are increasing: k7=76, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, k12=331 seems out of order though because 331 < 467? But maybe they are not in numerical order. Perhaps they are labeled by index only.\n\nMaybe I'll check ordering: k2, k3 are not given numerically, but k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 might be smaller than k7 if k2 and k3 are small numbers. Possibly the keys are not necessarily increasing in value.\n\nI must note that without context it's a guess.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll answer as clearly as possible:\n\nAnswer:\nWe write each key in the form\n\u2003\u2003k_n = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n).\nIn particular, from the problem we have:\n\u2003\u2003k_5 = k_2 \u00b7 k_3,\n\u2003\u2003k_7 = 10\u00d77 + 6,\n\u2003\u2003k_8 = 28\u00d78 + 0\u2003\u2003(\"clean\" because it divides evenly),\n\u2003\u2003k_9 = 51\u00d79 + 8,\n\u2003\u2003k_11 = 105\u00d711 + 0\u2003\u2003(\"clean\"),\nand\n\u2003\u2003k_12 = 28\u00d712 \u2212 5.\nThus, the f-values are:\n\u2003\u2003f(7) = 10,\n\u2003\u2003f(8) = 28,\n\u2003\u2003f(9) = 51,\n\u2003\u2003f(11) = 105,\nand in k_12 we see that 12 appears explicitly as a factor (with f(12)=28).\n\nI hope this answers the question. \n\nI'll now produce the final answer message.</think>One acceptable answer was to show that every key can be written in \u201cEuclidean\u2010division form\u201d\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n)\nand then to point out that in some cases the factor n appears explicitly.
