  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence, which is k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}, or maybe even with a constant term added, like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c. The problem gives me two equations based on the values of k7 and k8:\n\nFor k7 = 76:\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = 76a + 49b\n\nI need to find integers a and b that satisfy both equations. If that's not possible, then maybe there's a constant term c involved, so I should also check that case. Let me start with the first system of equations.\n\nFirst, let's write the two equations again:\n\n1) 49a + 21b = 76\n\n2) 76a + 49b = 224\n\nHmm, solving for a and b here. Since they need to be integers, maybe I can use the method of elimination or substitution. Let's try elimination. Let's multiply the first equation by 49 and the second equation by 21 so that the coefficients of b will be the same? Wait, actually, maybe a better approach is to solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nLet me try solving equation 1 for a:\n\n49a = 76 - 21b\n\n=> a = (76 - 21b)/49\n\nHmm, but since a has to be an integer, (76 - 21b) must be divisible by 49. Let me see if I can find an integer b that makes this so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract equations? Let me see.\n\nWait, let's write both equations again:\n\nEquation 1: 49a + 21b = 76\n\nEquation 2: 76a + 49b = 224\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nEquation1: 49a + 21b = 76\n\nEquation2: 76a + 49b = 224\n\nLet me multiply Equation1 by 76 and Equation2 by 49 to eliminate 'a'? Wait, that might be too big, but let's see:\n\nMultiply Equation1 by 76: 49*76 a + 21*76 b = 76*76\n\nMultiply Equation2 by 49: 76*49 a + 49*49 b = 224*49\n\nSubtract the first multiplied equation from the second multiplied equation?\n\nWait, but actually, if we do that, the a terms would be the same, so subtracting would eliminate a? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract equations in a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider setting up the equations as linear equations.\n\nLet me write them in terms of variables a and b.\n\nEquation1: 49a + 21b = 76\n\nEquation2: 76a + 49b = 224\n\nLet me write this as a matrix:\n\n[49  21 | 76]\n\n[76 49 | 224]\n\nMaybe use the elimination method. Let's try to eliminate one variable. Let's try to eliminate 'a' first.\n\nFirst, compute the coefficients:\n\nThe coefficients of a are 49 and 76. To eliminate, we can multiply the first equation by 76 and the second equation by 49, then subtract them.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst equation multiplied by 76:\n\n49*76 a + 21*76 b = 76*76\n\nSecond equation multiplied by 49:\n\n76*49 a + 49*49 b = 224*49\n\nSubtracting the first new equation from the second:\n\n(76*49a - 49*76a) + (49^2 b - 21*76 b) = 224*49 - 76^2*1\n\nWait, but actually, the a terms will cancel out? Wait, 49*76a - 76*49a = 0, so yes, the a terms cancel. Then:\n\nLeft side: (49^2 b - 21*76 b) = b*(49^2 - 21*76)\n\nRight side: 224*49 - 76^2\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nFirst, the left side:\n\n49^2 = 2401\n\n21*76 = 21*(70+6)=21*70 +21*6=1470 +126=1596\n\nSo 49\u00b2 -21\u00d776 = 2401 -1596 = 805\n\nTherefore left side is 805b\n\nRight side:\n\n224\u00d749: Let's compute 224\u00d750 = 11200, subtract 224 gives 11200 -224=10976\n\n76\u00b2 = 5776\n\nSo right side is 10976 - 5776 = 5200\n\nWait, wait, hold on: The right side is 224\u00d749 minus 76\u00d776?\n\nWait, original equations:\n\nAfter multiplying first by 76 and second by 49:\n\nEquation1*76: 49\u00d776a +21\u00d776b =76\u00d776\n\nEquation2*49:76\u00d749a +49\u00d749b =224\u00d749\n\nSubtract Equation1*76 from Equation2*49:\n\n[76\u00d749a -49\u00d776a] + [49\u00b2b -21\u00d776b] = 224\u00d749 -76\u00b2\u00d71\n\nSo the first term is zero, as before.\n\nThus, left side: 49\u00b2b -21\u00d776b = (49\u00b2 -21\u00d776)b = 805b\n\nRight side:224\u00d749 - (76\u00d776)\n\nWait, 224\u00d749 is 224*49. Let me compute that again:\n\n224 \u00d7 49:\n\n224 \u00d750 =11200, minus 224 gives 11200-224 =10976\n\n76\u00d776: 76 squared is 5776\n\nSo right side is 10976 -5776 =5200\n\nTherefore, 805b =5200\n\nSo b =5200 /805\n\nLet me compute this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n5200 \u00f75 =1040; 805 \u00f75=161\n\nSo 1040/161. Hmm, 161 \u00d76 =966, 1040-966=74, so 6 and 74/161. Not an integer.\n\nHmm, so that suggests that b is not integer here. Which is a problem, since we need a and b to be integers. So that would mean that there is no integer solution for a and b?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me check the steps again.\n\nFirst, starting with equations:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nTrying to eliminate a by multiplying equation1 by 76, equation2 by49, subtracting equation1*76 from equation2*49:\n\nLeft side:\n\n76\u00d749a -49\u00d776a =0\n\n49\u00b2b -21\u00d776b = (49\u00b2 -21\u00d776)b\n\nCompute 49\u00b2: 49\u00d749=2401\n\n21\u00d776: 21\u00d770=1470; 21\u00d76=126; total 1596\n\nThus, 2401-1596= 805, so 805b.\n\nRight side:\n\n224\u00d749 -76\u00d776\n\n224\u00d749=10976 (since 224\u00d750=11200 minus 224=10976)\n\n76\u00d776=5776\n\n10976-5776=5200. So 805b=5200\n\nThus, b=5200/805. Let me see if this reduces. Let's see GCD of 5200 and 805.\n\nDivide both by 5: 5200/5=1040; 805/5=161.\n\nSo 1040/161. Let's see if 161 divides into 1040.\n\n161\u00d76=966, 1040-966=74, so remainder 74. So no, not divisible. So b is 1040/161, which is not an integer. Hence, no solution?\n\nHmm. So that would mean there are no integer a and b that satisfy the equations. Therefore, the recurrence without a constant term (i.e., k_n =a k_{n-1}+b k_{n-2}) is not possible?\n\nBut the problem also mentions trying a recurrence with a constant term, like k_n = a k_{n-1} +b k_{n-2} +c. So maybe that's necessary.\n\nLet me try that. Let me set up equations with a, b, c.\n\nSo for k7=76:\n\n76 = a*k6 + b*k5 +c\n\nWait, but hold on: Wait, the user's problem mentions k7=76 and k8=224. But to set up equations with three variables a, b, c, I need a third equation. But perhaps they only provided two terms. Wait, maybe the previous terms k6 and k5 are known? Wait, in the original problem statement, the user says \"TEST: Can we find a, b such that k7 = a\u00d7k6 + b\u00d7k5...\", but in the problem above, they just give the equations for k7 and k8. Wait, perhaps the user assumes prior terms? For example, in the problem, to get k7, they used k6=49 and k5=21? Because in the first equation given:\n\nFor k7 =76: 76 = a\u00d749 +b\u00d721\n\nAh! Wait, so they are assuming that k6=49 and k5=21? Maybe the prior terms are known? So perhaps the problem is part of a larger sequence where k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224, and we have to see if the next terms follow a linear recurrence.\n\nWait, the user hasn't given all the terms, but in their equations, for k7 they use k_{n-1}=49 and k_{n-2}=21, so presumably k6=49 and k5=21. Similarly, for k8=224, they use k7=76 and k6=49. So the prior terms are k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224. So maybe the sequence is:\n\nAssuming the indices:\n\nk5=21,\n\nk6=49,\n\nk7=76,\n\nk8=224,\n\nand we need to see if a linear recurrence (with or without constant) can predict these terms.\n\nTherefore, to check for a recurrence with constant term c, we need three equations. Since we have k5, k6, k7, k8, we can set up equations for k7, k8, and maybe k9 if we had it. But since we don't have k9, perhaps we can set up two equations with three variables, which would be underdetermined, but maybe the user wants to see if there exists some a, b, c that can satisfy both equations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps proceed step by step.\n\nLet me try with the constant term.\n\nSuppose k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2} + c.\n\nThen, for k7=76:\n\n76 = a*49 + b*21 + c\n\nSimilarly, for k8=224:\n\n224 = a*76 + b*49 + c\n\nSo now we have two equations with three variables a, b, c. To solve, we need a third equation. But since we don't have k9, perhaps we can assume that the recurrence is valid for all n \u2265 some number, so maybe we can use previous terms. Let's see, if we have k6=49, could we use the recurrence for k6?\n\nWait, if the recurrence is supposed to hold for n \u2265 7, then k7 is the first term computed via the recurrence, so prior terms might not be covered. But if the recurrence is supposed to hold for all n \u22653, then we could use k6 as well. Let me see:\n\nIf the recurrence is supposed to hold for n \u22653, then to get k7, we need k6 and k5, which are known, so that's okay. To get k6, we need k5 and k4. But we don't know k4, so that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only concerned with whether the recurrence works from k7 onwards. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can just set up two equations with three variables and see if there is a solution. Let me see.\n\nEquation1:49a +21b +c =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b +c =224\n\nSubtract equation1 from equation2:\n\n(76a -49a) + (49b -21b) + (c -c)=224-76\n\nSo 27a +28b =148\n\nSo now, we have 27a +28b =148.\n\nThis is an equation with two variables. Let me see if there are integer solutions here.\n\nWe can write this as 27a =148 -28b\n\nThus a=(148 -28b)/27\n\nWe need (148 -28b) divisible by 27. Let me see possible integer values for b.\n\nLet me try to find integers a and b such that 27a +28b =148.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express in terms of modulo.\n\nLet me consider 27a \u2261148 mod28\n\n27 mod28 is 27, so 27a \u2261148 mod28\n\nBut 148 divided by28: 28*5=140, so 148-140=8, so 148\u22618 mod28.\n\nThus, 27a \u22618 mod28.\n\nWe can write this as 27a \u22618 mod28.\n\nSince 27 and 28 are coprime (gcd(27,28)=1), so inverse of 27 mod28 exists.\n\nFind the inverse of27 mod28.\n\nLooking for x such that27x\u22611 mod28.\n\n27x mod28:\n\n27\u2261-1 mod28, so (-1)x\u22611 mod28 \u2192 -x\u22611 mod28 \u2192x\u2261-1 mod28\u2192x=27 mod28.\n\nThus inverse of27 mod28 is27.\n\nThus, multiplying both sides by27:\n\na\u22618\u00d727 mod28\n\nCompute8\u00d727=216. 216 mod28:\n\n28\u00d77=196, 216-196=20. So a\u226120 mod28.\n\nThus, a=28k +20 for some integerk.\n\nThen, plug back into equation 27a +28b=148:\n\n27*(28k +20) +28b =148\n\nCompute 27*28k +27*20 +28b =148\n\n27*28k = 756k\n\n27*20=540\n\nThus,\n\n756k +540 +28b =148\n\n\u2192756k +28b=148 -540= -392\n\nDivide both sides by28:\n\n27k +b = -14\n\n\u2192b= -14 -27k\n\nThus, for any integerk, we have solutions:\n\na=28k +20,\n\nb= -14 -27k,\n\nand then c can be found from equation1:\n\nc=76 -49a -21b\n\nPlugging in a and b:\n\nc=76 -49*(28k+20) -21*(-14 -27k)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n49*(28k +20)=49*28k +49*20=1372k +980\n\n21*(-14 -27k)= -294 -567k\n\nThus,\n\nc=76 - (1372k +980) - (-294 -567k)=76 -1372k -980 +294 +567k\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-1372k +567k= (-1372+567)k= -805k\n\n76 -980 +294=76 -686= -610\n\nThus,\n\nc= -805k -610\n\nTherefore, the solutions are parameterized by integerk:\n\na=28k +20,\n\nb= -14 -27k,\n\nc= -805k -610.\n\nSo there are infinitely many solutions, depending on k. However, we might want to find integer solutions where a, b, c are integers. Since k can be any integer, but likely the problem expects small integers, perhaps k=0?\n\nLet me try k=0:\n\nThen,\n\na=20,\n\nb= -14,\n\nc= -610.\n\nCheck if this works in equation1:\n\n49a +21b +c =49*20 +21*(-14) +(-610)= 980 -294 -610=980 -904=76. Correct.\n\nEquation2:\n\n76a +49b +c=76*20 +49*(-14)+(-610)=1520 -686 -610=1520-1296=224. Correct.\n\nSo this is a valid solution. Let's see if there are other small k values.\n\nk= -1:\n\na=28*(-1)+20= -8,\n\nb= -14 -27*(-1)= -14 +27=13,\n\nc= -805*(-1) -610=805 -610=195.\n\nCheck equation1: 49*(-8) +21*13 +195= -392 +273 +195= (-392 +468)=76. Correct.\n\nEquation2:76*(-8)+49*13 +195= -608 +637 +195= ( -608 +637)=29 +195=224. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, k=1:\n\na=28*1+20=48,\n\nb= -14 -27*1= -41,\n\nc= -805*1 -610= -1415.\n\nCheck equation1:49*48 +21*(-41) + (-1415)=2352 -861 -1415=2352 -2276=76. Correct.\n\nEquation2:76*48 +49*(-41) +(-1415)=3648 -2009 -1415=3648-3424=224. Correct.\n\nSo these all work. So there are infinitely many solutions with a constant term. However, the problem might prefer the simplest one, perhaps with the smallest absolute values for a, b, c. For k=0, we have a=20, b=-14, c= -610. That's a large c. For k=-1, a=-8, b=13, c=195. Still, some are negative. For k= -2, let's see:\n\nk=-2:\n\na=28*(-2)+20= -56 +20= -36,\n\nb= -14 -27*(-2)= -14 +54=40,\n\nc= -805*(-2)-610=1610-610=1000.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a recurrence without a constant term, but since that doesn't work, then the minimal c is needed. Alternatively, maybe there is a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, or maybe I misread the prior terms. Wait, let me check again the initial equations given:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"For k7 =76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n\nFor k8=224: 224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\"\n\nSo they are setting up equations assuming that the recurrence is k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2}, so the prior terms for k7 would be k6=49 and k5=21, and for k8, it's k7=76 and k6=49.\n\nTherefore, if we consider that the recurrence must hold for k7 and k8, then with two equations and two variables (a and b), but we saw that there's no solution. Therefore, the user suggests trying with a constant term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a context where the terms before k5 are known? For example, if the sequence is something like Fibonacci or another known sequence, but with modifications. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the style of the user providing k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224 and wants us to see if they follow a linear recurrence relation, possibly with a constant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem's numbers? Let me see.\n\nWait, let's see what a linear recurrence with a constant term would look like. Suppose that the recurrence is k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2} +c. To have two equations for three variables, but with the constant, but perhaps there is a unique solution if we assume that the recurrence holds for the previous term as well. For example, if we use k6 as well.\n\nWait, if we use k6=49, then for n=6, we can write:\n\nk6 = a k5 + b k4 +c\n\nBut we don't know k4. So that might not help. Alternatively, maybe the recurrence is supposed to start at n=7, so that prior to that, the terms are arbitrary? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in calculations. Let me recalculate the equations without constant term.\n\nEquation1:49a +21b=76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b=224\n\nLet me write this as a system:\n\n49a +21b =76 --> equation1\n\n76a +49b =224 --> equation2\n\nLet me try to solve this system.\n\nMultiply equation1 by 49 and equation2 by21 to eliminate b:\n\nEquation1 *49:49*49 a +21*49 b=76*49\n\nEquation2*21:76*21 a +49*21 b=224*21\n\nSubtract equation1*49 - equation2*21:\n\n(49^2 -76*21)a + (21*49 -49*21)b =76*49 -224*21\n\nThe b terms cancel out.\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\n49^2 =2401,\n\n76*21=1596,\n\nso 2401 -1596=805,\n\nThus 805a =76*49 -224*21\n\nCompute RHS:\n\n76*49: 70*49=3430, 6*49=294 \u2192 total 3430+294=3724\n\n224*21=4704\n\nThus,\n\n805a=3724 -4704= -980\n\nThus,\n\na= -980/805 = -196/161 = -28*7/(23*7) = -28/23 \u2248-1.217\n\nHmm, fractional. So that would mean a is not integer. Therefore, no integer solutions for a and b in the system without constant term. Hence, impossible.\n\nTherefore, the user is correct in suggesting that we need to consider a constant term.\n\nNow, with the constant term, as we saw, there are infinitely many solutions. But perhaps the problem expects the minimal or simplest solution, or maybe it's part of a different recurrence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the user to consider a second-order linear recurrence with constant coefficients, but since that's not possible, then perhaps the answer is that no such recurrence exists without a constant term, and with a constant term, there are infinitely many.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants us to find the recurrence with the minimal |a| + |b| + |c| or something, but without additional constraints, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is part of a problem where you have to find a, b, c such that the recurrence holds for all terms, but since we only have two equations, but three unknowns, unless more terms are given.\n\nWait, the user hasn't provided more terms, but perhaps in the problem's context, maybe there are more terms? The original question is just what's presented here?\n\nWait, the user's message starts with \"Futhermore, please...\" implying that this is a follow-up, but in the current prompt, it's just the initial question. Maybe the user is asking to solve for a, b, c given the two equations, acknowledging that there are infinitely many solutions, but to present the general solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the user to recognize that a linear recurrence of order 2 with constant term can be found, but since the user might have made a typo in the numbers, but assuming the numbers are correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in calculations. Let me verify:\n\nFor the constant term case, taking k=-1 gives a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nTesting this recurrence for the next term, if there was a k9, but since we don't have data, but perhaps to check consistency between terms.\n\nAlternatively, to see if the recurrence can also predict k6 from previous terms? Let's see.\n\nWait, if we assume the recurrence holds for k6 as well:\n\nk6 = a k5 + b k4 +c\n\nBut we don't know k4, so maybe it's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to write the general form of the recurrence relation. The user might have asked \"Find a, b, and c such that the recurrence relation holds\", so the answer is that there are infinitely many solutions parameterized by k, as above.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a unique solution if we assume that the constant term is zero, but that's impossible as we saw.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the system of equations?\n\nWait let me re-express the equations:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b +c =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b +c =224\n\nSubtract equation1 from equation2:\n\n(76a -49a) + (49b -21b) + (c -c) =224-76\n\n27a +28b =148\n\nSo equation:27a +28b =148\n\nAnd equation1:49a +21b =76 -c\n\nBut since c is a variable, perhaps we can set up the two equations:\n\n27a +28b=148,\n\nand 49a +21b =76 -c.\n\nBut without another equation, we can't solve for c uniquely.\n\nAlternatively, if we set up the two equations with the two terms and a constant, we can write:\n\nThe system is:\n\n49a +21b +c =76,\n\n76a +49b +c =224,\n\nwhich can be rewritten as:\n\n(49a +21b) +c =76,\n\n(76a +49b) +c =224.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n\n(76a +49b -49a -21b) =224 -76,\n\nwhich is 27a +28b =148,\n\nso 27a +28b=148.\n\nSo that equation must be satisfied. Then, c can be expressed as c=76 -49a -21b.\n\nSo, to find integer solutions for a and b such that 27a +28b=148,\n\nthen c is determined.\n\nSo the problem reduces to solving 27a +28b=148 for integers a and b.\n\nThis is a linear Diophantine equation.\n\nLet me solve 27a +28b =148.\n\nFirst, find one particular solution.\n\nWe can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nCompute GCD(27,28):\n\nGCD(27,28)=1, since 28=1*27 +1,\n\n27=27*1 +0,\n\nso GCD is 1, which divides 148, so solutions exist.\n\nFind integers x,y such that 27x +28y =1.\n\nFrom the Euclidean steps:\n\n28=1*27 +1,\n\nso 1=28 -1*27,\n\nThus, 1= (-1)*27 +1*28,\n\nMultiply both sides by 148:\n\n148= (-148)*27 +148*28.\n\nHence, one particular solution is a_p= -148, b_p=148.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na = a_p +28t,\n\nb = b_p -27t,\n\nfor integer t.\n\nBecause coefficients are 27 and 28, which are coprime, so the coefficients for t are 28 and -27.\n\nThus,\n\na= -148 +28t,\n\nb=148 -27t,\n\nfor integer t.\n\nThus, the solutions for a and b are parameterized by t.\n\nThen c=76 -49a -21b.\n\nPlugging in a and b:\n\nc=76 -49*(-148 +28t) -21*(148 -27t)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n49*(-148)= -49*148,\n\n49*28t=1372t,\n\n21*148= 21*(100+48)=2100 +1008=3108,\n\n21*(-27t)= -567t.\n\nThus,\n\nc=76 +49*148 -49*28t -21*148 +21*27t\n\nCombine constants:\n\n76 + (49*148 -21*148)=76 +148*(49-21)=76 +148*28.\n\nCompute 148*28:\n\n148*28= (100*28)+(48*28)=2800 +1344=4144,\n\nThus,\n\n76 +4144=4220.\n\nNow, terms with t:\n\n-49*28t +21*27t= (-1372t +567t)= (-805t).\n\nThus,\n\nc=4220 -805t.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na= -148 +28t,\n\nb=148 -27t,\n\nc=4220 -805t,\n\nfor integer t.\n\nThis is the same as earlier parameterization but with t = -k - something. Let me see:\n\nIn the previous approach with k, we had:\n\na=28k +20,\n\nb= -14 -27k,\n\nc= -805k -610.\n\nIf I set t such that:\n\n-148 +28t =28k +20,\n\nthen 28t=28k +168 \u21d2 t=k +6,\n\nthen:\n\nb=148 -27t=148-27(k+6)=148 -27k -162= -14 -27k,\n\nwhich matches,\n\nand c=4220 -805t=4220 -805(k+6)=4220 -4830 -805k= -610 -805k,\n\nso yes, same as previous with t= k+6.\n\nThus, the solutions are indeed the same.\n\nTherefore, the minimal solution in terms of small coefficients would be when choosing t such that a, b, c are minimized in absolute value.\n\nLet me find t such that a and b are small.\n\nTake t=6,\n\nthen,\n\na= -148 +28*6= -148+168=20,\n\nb=148 -27*6=148-162= -14,\n\nc=4220 -805*6=4220-4830= -610,\n\nwhich is the solution for t=6 (k=0).\n\nTake t=5,\n\na= -148 +140= -8,\n\nb=148-135=13,\n\nc=4220 -4025=195,\n\n(t=5 corresponds to k= -1).\n\nt=4,\n\na= -148 +112= -36,\n\nb=148-108=40,\n\nc=4220-3220=1000,\n\nwhich is larger.\n\nt=7,\n\na= -148+196=48,\n\nb=148-189= -41,\n\nc=4220 -5635= -1415,\n\nso coefficients get larger.\n\nt= -1,\n\na= -148 -28= -176,\n\nb=148 +27=175,\n\nc=4220 +805=5025,\n\nso worse.\n\nThus, the smallest coefficients in absolute value are at t=5 (k=-1):\n\na= -8,\n\nb=13,\n\nc=195,\n\nand t=6 (k=0):\n\na=20,\n\nb=-14,\n\nc= -610.\n\nBetween these, perhaps the first is better.\n\nAlternatively, if we want a and b to be positive, then t=6 gives a=20, b=-14,\n\nbut b is negative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the minimal in some other sense.\n\nAlternatively, the question might be to find such a recurrence relation, and present the general form, but since the user hasn't specified more constraints, perhaps present the general solution.\n\nAlternatively, the user might have a typo, but since I have to go with the given info.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is to find a second-order linear recurrence without constant term, but it's impossible as we saw.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have more terms which were not included here.\n\nBut since the user only provided these two equations, I have to work with that.\n\nGiven that, the answer is that there are infinitely many solutions parameterized by an integer t, with a= -148+28t, b=148-27t, c=4220-805t.\n\nBut since the problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", which usually expects a specific numerical answer. This suggests maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the question is to find integers a, b, c such that for the given terms, the recurrence holds, and perhaps the minimal positive coefficients or something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find a linear recurrence of order 2 without a constant term, but that requires 27a +28b=148 and c=0,\n\nso set c=0,\n\nthen 49a +21b =76,\n\nand 27a +28b=148,\n\nsolve these two equations:\n\nLet me try:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76,\n\nEquation2:27a +28b=148.\n\nLet me solve this system.\n\nMultiply Equation1 by 28: 49*28a +21*28b =76*28,\n\nMultiply Equation2 by21:27*21a +28*21b=148*21,\n\nSubtract equation2*21 from equation1*28:\n\n(49*28a -27*21a) + (21*28b -28*21b)=76*28 -148*21,\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\na terms: a*(49*28 -27*21)=a*(1372 -567)=a*805,\n\nb terms: 21*28b -28*21b=0,\n\nThus,\n\n805a =76*28 -148*21,\n\nCompute RHS:\n\n76*28=2128,\n\n148*21=3108,\n\nThus,\n\n805a=2128-3108= -980,\n\nThus,\n\na= -980 /805= simplify,\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n-196 /161,\n\nWhich reduces to -28/23, not integer.\n\nThus, no integer solution with c=0.\n\nHence, no solution without constant term.\n\nTherefore, the problem requires a constant term, and the answer is that infinitely many solutions exist, but if we need to write one possible solution, like the one with smallest coefficients, then a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be to find the recurrence relation of the form x\u2099 = a x\u2099\u208b\u2081 + b x\u2099\u208b\u2082 + c, and with the given terms, perhaps the user provided terms like x\u2085= something, but since only two equations are given, the system is underdetermined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from a context where the sequence is defined by a linear recurrence of order 2 with constant term, and the user is to find the coefficients using two terms. But with two terms, you can't determine three variables.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the style of \"Find integers a,b,c such that the recurrence relation x\u2099 = a x\u2099\u208b\u2081 +b x\u2099\u208b\u2082 +c holds for n\u22652, given that x\u2082=76 and x\u2083=224\". But even then, we need more terms.\n\nAlternatively, if x\u2081 and x\u2082 are given, then x\u2083= a x\u2082 +b x\u2081 +c,\n\nx\u2084= a x\u2083 +b x\u2082 +c,\n\nBut with only x\u2082 and x\u2083 provided, we can't form two equations unless assuming previous terms.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented as: Find a, b, c such that for a sequence where the second term is 76 and the third term is 224, and the recurrence relation is x\u2099 = a x\u2099\u208b\u2081 + b x\u2099\u208b\u2082 + c for n \u22653. But without more terms, there are infinitely many solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is to find such a recurrence relation that has 76 and 224 as consecutive terms, but without additional data, it's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in omitting terms. Alternatively, maybe the question is from a problem where the first two terms are given, say x\u2081 and x\u2082, then x\u2083=76, x\u2084=224, but that wasn't stated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to a previous problem where more context was given, but in the current prompt, it's just the two equations.\n\nGiven the instructions, the user might expect the general solution or a particular solution. Since the problem asks for the final answer boxed, perhaps the user expects the simplest solution in integers. Taking the solution with t=5 (a=-8, b=13, c=195):\n\nCheck if this works:\n\nSuppose we have a sequence where, for example, x\u2081 and x\u2082 are some numbers, then x\u2083= a x\u2082 +b x\u2081 +c.\n\nIf x\u2083=76 and x\u2084=224,\n\nAssuming the recurrence is x\u2099 = -8x\u2099\u208b\u2081 +13x\u2099\u208b\u2082 +195,\n\nLet\u2019s suppose initial terms:\n\nLet\u2019s say x\u2081 = k, x\u2082 = m,\n\nthen x\u2083= -8m +13k +195 =76,\n\nand x\u2084= -8x\u2083 +13x\u2082 +195 = -8*76 +13*m +195 = -608 +13m +195 =13m -413,\n\nWe are told x\u2084=224,\n\nThus:\n\n13m -413 =224 \u21d213m=637 \u21d2m=49,\n\nThen from x\u2083 equation:\n\n-8*49 +13k +195=76,\n\nCompute:\n\n-392 +13k +195=76,\n\n( -392 +195)= -197,\n\nso -197 +13k=76,\n\n13k=273 \u21d2k=21,\n\nThus, with x\u2081=21, x\u2082=49,\n\nthen x\u2083= -8*49 +13*21 +195= -392 +273 +195= ( -392 +468)=76,\n\nx\u2084= -8*76 +13*49 +195= -608 +637 +195= ( -608+637)=29 +195=224,\n\nYes, it works.\n\nThus, this is a valid solution with a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nAlternatively, another solution like a=20, b=-14, c=-610,\n\nCheck:\n\nSuppose x\u2081=p, x\u2082=q,\n\nx\u2083=20q -14p -610 =76,\n\nx\u2084=20x\u2083 -14x\u2082 -610=20*76 -14q -610=1520 -14q -610= 910 -14q =224,\n\nThus,\n\n910 -14q=224 \u21d2-14q= -686 \u21d2q=49,\n\nThen from x\u2083 equation,\n\n20*49 -14p -610=76,\n\n980 -14p -610=76,\n\n370 -14p=76 \u21d2-14p= -294 \u21d2p=21,\n\nSame initial terms, so both solutions correspond to the same recurrence with different representations? Wait no, the coefficients are different but with the same initial terms, but the recurrence equations are different.\n\nWait, but with a=-8, b=13, c=195,\n\nand a=20, b=-14, c=-610,\n\nThese are different recurrences,\n\nBut both can produce the terms 76 and 224 given x\u2081=21 and x\u2082=49,\n\nWait, how?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor the first recurrence (a=-8, b=13, c=195):\n\nx\u2083 = -8x\u2082 +13x\u2081 +195,\n\nWith x\u2081=21, x\u2082=49,\n\nx\u2083= -8*49 +13*21 +195 = -392 +273 +195=76,\n\nx\u2084= -8*76 +13*49 +195= -608+637+195=224,\n\nFor the second recurrence (a=20, b=-14, c=-610):\n\nx\u2083=20x\u2082 -14x\u2081 -610,\n\nWith x\u2081=21, x\u2082=49,\n\nx\u2083=20*49 -14*21 -610= 980 -294 -610=76,\n\nx\u2084=20x\u2083 -14x\u2082 -610=20*76 -14*49 -610=1520 -686 -610=224,\n\nSo both recurrences can generate the terms with the same initial conditions. Thus, they are different recurrences but can produce the same terms with adjusted initial conditions.\n\nTherefore, there are infinitely many solutions depending on the initial terms.\n\nBut since the problem mentions \"the\" recurrence relation, but it's underdetermined, so likely expects the user to present one possible solution, possibly the one with smallest coefficients.\n\nBetween a=-8, b=13, c=195 and a=20, b=-14, c=-610,\n\nThe first has smaller absolute values for a and b, so maybe that's preferable.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect writing the recurrence in terms of previous terms without constants, but since it's impossible, the answer must include the constant term.\n\nAlternatively, the question might have a typo and actually provides more terms, but as per given info, I'll proceed with the most reasonable answer.\n\nGiven that, I think the expected answer is likely a=-8, b=13, c=195, as it's a simple integer solution.\n\nThus, boxed:\n\n\\boxed{a = -8}, \\boxed{b = 13}, \\boxed{c = 195}\n\nBut the question might expect them combined in a single box as a triplet: \\boxed{(-8, 13, 195)} or similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find a monic recurrence or something else.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is in another context, like a quadratic equation? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers 76 and 224 are results of some quadratic expression, but the question mentions recurrence.\n\nWait, maybe it's a second-order linear recurrence without constant term, but as we saw no solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to write x\u2099 = a x\u2099\u208b\u2081 +b with two terms, but even then two equations for a and b:\n\n76 = a x\u2081 + b,\n\n224 = a 76 +b,\n\nThen solving,\n\nSubtract: 224 -76 = a(76 -x\u2081),\n\nBut without x\u2081, can't solve.\n\nAlternatively, if it's first order: x\u2099 = a x\u2099\u208b\u2081 +b,\n\nThen,\n\n76 = a x\u2081 +b,\n\n224 = a 76 +b,\n\nSubtract gives 148 = a(76 -x\u2081),\n\nStill needs x\u2081.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a second difference? Not sure.\n\nGiven the problem's ambiguity but the standard approach for such problems with two terms to find a second-order recurrence with constant term, the standard method would set up the equations and solve for a, b, c with some assumption, but since it's underdetermined, pick a parameter.\n\nBut in many standard problems, they might assume that the constant term c is zero, but that doesn't work here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the recurrence is of order 1 with constant term, so:\n\nx\u2099 = a x\u2099\u208b\u2081 + c,\n\nThen with two terms,\n\n76 = a x\u2081 +c,\n\n224 =a 76 +c,\n\nSubtract,\n\n224-76 =a(76 -x\u2081),\n\nStill need x\u2081.\n\nAlternatively, maybe x\u2081 is given as the first term, but not provided.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different setup. Since I might be overcomplicating,\n\nGiven the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", maybe the question is to solve for a, b, c in some way I missed?\n\nWait, the original problem might be: \"Find integers a, b, c such that 76 and 224 satisfy the equation ax + by + c = 0\", but that would be different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is to solve the system:\n\n76a + 224b +c =0,\n\nBut with three variables, infinite solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nGiven the information I have, the most reasonable answer is the triplet (-8,13,195), so I'll box that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe integers are \\boxed{-8}, \\boxed{13}, and \\boxed{195}.\n",
