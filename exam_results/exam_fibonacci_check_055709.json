  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence, which means checking if there exist constants a and b such that each term k_n is equal to a times the previous term plus b times the term before that. The user provided the equations for k7 and k8, which are 76 and 224 respectively. Let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right.\n\nFor k7 = 76:\n76 = a * 49 + b * 21\nWhich can be written as 49a + 21b = 76.\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = a * 76 + b * 49\nWhich is 76a + 49b = 224.\n\nSo, I need to solve this system of equations to see if there are integer solutions for a and b. The problem also mentions trying a recurrence with a constant term c, but maybe I should first check if a linear recurrence without the constant works.\n\nStarting with the two equations:\n\n1) 49a + 21b = 76\n\n2) 76a + 49b = 224\n\nHmm, I can try to solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination. Maybe multiply the first equation by 76 and the second by 49 to eliminate a? Wait, that might get too big. Alternatively, let me see if I can manipulate them differently.\n\nAlternatively, let me write the equations in a more manageable form. Let me see:\n\nEquation 1: 49a + 21b = 76\n\nEquation 2: 76a + 49b = 224\n\nHmm, maybe I can multiply the first equation by 49 and the second by 21 to make the coefficients of b the same? Let me try that.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 49: 49*49a + 49*21b = 49*76\n\nWhich is 2401a + 1029b = 3724\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 21: 21*76a + 21*49b = 21*224\n\nCalculating coefficients:\n\n21*76: 21*70=1470, 21*6=126, so total 1470+126=1596. So 1596a\n\n21*49: That's 21*50 -21 = 1050 -21= 1029. So 1029b\n\nRight side: 21*224 = let's see, 20*224=4480, 1*224=224, total 4480+224=4704\n\nSo equation 2 becomes 1596a + 1029b = 4704\n\nNow, subtract equation 1 multiplied by 49 from equation 2 multiplied by 21? Wait, actually, after multiplying, we have:\n\nFirst modified equation: 2401a + 1029b = 3724\n\nSecond modified equation: 1596a + 1029b = 4704\n\nWait, actually, the second modified equation is 1596a + 1029b = 4704\n\nSo if I subtract the first modified equation from the second modified equation, the b terms will cancel?\n\nWait, actually, wait. Let me check:\n\nWait, equation 1 was multiplied by 49:\n\n2401a + 1029b = 3724\n\nEquation 2 multiplied by 21:\n\n1596a + 1029b = 4704\n\nSo subtract equation1_modified from equation2_modified:\n\n(1596a - 2401a) + (1029b - 1029b) = 4704 - 3724\n\nThat gives:\n\n-805a = 980\n\nTherefore, a = -980 / 805\n\nHmm, simplifying this fraction. Let's see, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5?\n\n980 \u00f75 = 196; 805 \u00f75 = 161. So -196/161. Hmm, can this be reduced further? Let's see 196 and 161.\n\n161 is 23*7, 196 is 28*7. So 7 is a common factor. 196 \u00f77 =28; 161 \u00f77=23.\n\nTherefore, a = -28/23.\n\nHmm, that's a fraction. So a is -28/23. Then plug back into one of the equations to find b.\n\nLet's use equation 1: 49a +21b =76\n\nPlugging a = -28/23:\n\n49*(-28/23) +21b =76\n\nCompute 49*(-28)/23:\n\n49*28 = 1372, so -1372/23 +21b =76\n\nThen 21b =76 +1372/23\n\nConvert 76 to over 23: 76*23=1748, so 76 =1748/23\n\nThus, 21b = (1748 +1372)/23 = (3120)/23\n\nTherefore, b = (3120)/(23*21) = 3120/(483)\n\nSimplify 3120 divided by 483.\n\nLet me see if they have common factors. 483 divided by 3 is 161, 3120 divided by 3 is 1040.\n\nSo 3120/483 = 1040/161. 161 is 23*7, and 1040 divided by 7? 1040 \u00f77 is about 148.57, not integer. So 1040/161 is the simplest. So b=1040/161.\n\nHmm, so a is -28/23 and b is 1040/161. These are not integers. The question was asking if there are integer a and b. Since these are fractions, that suggests that there are no integer solutions for a and b. Therefore, the recurrence without a constant term (c) does not hold with integer coefficients.\n\nBut the user also mentioned trying a recurrence with a constant term c: k_n = a*k_{n-1} + b*k_{n-2} + c. Maybe that's necessary? Let me check.\n\nSo now, adding a constant term c, so the equations become:\n\nFor k7 =76:\n\n76 = a*k6 + b*k5 + c = a*49 + b*21 +c --> 49a +21b +c =76\n\nFor k8=224:\n\n224 =a*k7 +b*k6 +c = a*76 + b*49 +c -->76a +49b +c=224\n\nSo now, we have two equations with three variables a,b,c. But we need another equation to solve for three variables. However, since we only have data up to k8, perhaps we can see if with the addition of c, the system can be consistent?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can set up equations to eliminate c?\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(76a +49b +c) - (49a +21b +c) =224 -76\n\nWhich gives:\n\n27a +28b =148\n\nSo 27a +28b =148\n\nNow, this is one equation with two variables a and b, but we can look for integer solutions here. Let me see.\n\nWe can write this as 27a =148 -28b\n\nThus, a=(148 -28b)/27\n\nWe need a to be integer, so (148 -28b) must be divisible by 27.\n\nLet me see possible integer values for b that make 148 -28b divisible by 27.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider modulo 27:\n\n148 mod27: 27*5=135, so 148-135=13, so 148 \u226113 mod27\n\n28 mod27 is 1, so 28b mod27 is b mod27.\n\nThus equation: 148 -28b \u22610 mod27 \u219213 - b \u22610 mod27 \u2192 -b \u2261 -13 mod27 \u2192 b \u226113 mod27\n\nSo b=13 +27k, where k is integer.\n\nSo possible values for b are 13, 40, -14, etc.\n\nLet me try b=13:\n\nThen a=(148 -28*13)/27 = (148-364)/27 = (-216)/27 = -8\n\nSo a= -8, b=13. Let me check if this works.\n\nThen c can be found from first equation: 49a +21b +c =76\n\nPlugging a=-8, b=13:\n\n49*(-8) +21*13 +c =76\n\nCompute 49*(-8)= -392; 21*13=273\n\nSo -392 +273 +c =76 \u2192 (-119) +c=76 \u2192 c=76+119=195\n\nSo c=195. Let me check if this works in the second equation:\n\n76a +49b +c =76*(-8)+49*13 +195\n\n76*(-8)= -608; 49*13=637; so total: -608 +637 +195 = (29) +195=224. Perfect, that matches.\n\nSo with a= -8, b=13, c=195, the equations are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence relation with a constant term is possible with these integer coefficients.\n\nWait, but before jumping to conclusions, the user mentioned \"if there's a recurrence, we can predict k15, k16\". So we need to check if this recurrence holds for the previous terms as well? Because maybe the given terms up to k8 are part of the sequence, but unless the recurrence is consistent with prior terms, it might not be valid. However, the problem didn't provide the earlier terms beyond k5=21 and k6=49. Wait, actually, in the initial problem statement, the user refers to k7 and k8. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the user says:\n\n\"TEST: Can we find a, b such that k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\n\nFor k7 = 76:\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n224 = 76a + 49b\"\n\nSo they assume that k5=21, k6=49, then k7 is given as 76, k8 as 224. So to check the recurrence with a constant, we can see if previous terms fit. Let's see, if the recurrence is k_n = -8*k_{n-1} +13*k_{n-2} +195, does that hold for earlier terms?\n\nWait, but to check that, we need to know the prior terms. Since we only have up to k8, but the recurrence would require going back further. Let's see, for example, let's see if the recurrence can be used to compute k7 from k6 and k5, then k8 from k7 and k6. Since we know k5=21, k6=49, let's see:\n\nUsing the recurrence: k7 = -8*k6 +13*k5 +195\n\nPlugging in numbers: -8*49 +13*21 +195\n\nCompute:\n\n-392 + 273 +195 = (-392 +273)= -119 +195=76. Perfect.\n\nSimilarly, k8 = -8*k7 +13*k6 +195 = -8*76 +13*49 +195\n\nCompute:\n\n-608 + 637 +195 = (29) +195=224. Correct.\n\nSo that works for k7 and k8. But to check consistency, we need to see if prior terms would fit. Since k5 and k6 are given as 21 and 49, but to compute k6 using the recurrence, we would need k5 and k4. Since we don't have k4, but maybe the recurrence is only valid from some point onward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem only requires that the recurrence holds for k7 and k8, but we need to see if it can be extended.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem didn't provide earlier terms, so perhaps the user is okay with just the existence of such a recurrence that works for k7 and k8 with constants a,b,c? But the user also mentions predicting k15, k16, so probably the recurrence should hold for the entire sequence, so we need to check whether the prior terms could fit the recurrence.\n\nWait, but we don't have data beyond k8. Hmm. However, if we can assume that the recurrence starts from k5 and k6, then the next terms can be calculated. Let me see if this recurrence is plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user just wants to know if such a recurrence exists (with constants a,b,c) that fits k7 and k8. Since we found integer a,b,c, that would be possible. So the answer is yes, there is a linear recurrence with constant term that works. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects to check first without the constant and since that didn't work with integers, then try with the constant. Since with the constant, we found integer coefficients, so that is the answer.\n\nBut let me check if there could be another recurrence with smaller constants or different a,b,c. Alternatively, maybe there's another solution for a,b,c?\n\nLooking back at the equation 27a +28b =148, with b=13 +27k, so for example, if k= -1, then b=13 -27= -14, then a= (148 -28*(-14))/27= (148 +392)/27=540/27=20. So a=20, b= -14. Then c would be?\n\nUsing first equation 49a +21b +c =76:\n\n49*20 +21*(-14) +c = 980 -294 +c = 686 +c =76 \u2192 c=76 -686= -610\n\nThen check second equation:\n\n76a +49b +c =76*20 +49*(-14) + (-610)\n\n76*20=1520, 49*(-14)= -686, so total:1520-686-610=1520-1296=224. Correct.\n\nSo another solution is a=20, b=-14, c=-610. So there are infinitely many solutions because we have three variables and two equations. But the question is whether there exists any integer a,b,c. Since we have at least two solutions, the answer is yes.\n\nHowever, the problem initially asked if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence (without constant term). Since that requires a and b to be integers and we found that without a constant term, there are no integer solutions (since a was -28/23 and b was 1040/161), so it does not follow a linear recurrence of order 2 without a constant term. But with a constant term, it does.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that with a constant term, such a recurrence exists with integer coefficients, for example a=-8, b=13, c=195. So the user can use this to predict further terms.\n\nLet me confirm by computing the next term k9 using the recurrence:\n\nk9 = a*k8 + b*k7 + c = (-8)*224 +13*76 +195\n\nCompute:\n\n-1792 + 988 +195 = (-1792 +988)= -804 +195= -609\n\nHmm, that seems a bit odd, but arithmetic is correct. Let me check again:\n\n-8*224 = -1792\n\n13*76: 70*13=910, 6*13=78 \u2192 910+78=988\n\nSo -1792 +988 = -804, plus 195 is indeed -609. So k9 would be -609? That might be unexpected, but unless there is a different prior term, it's possible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's initial terms are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check with another solution, a=20, b=-14, c=-610:\n\nk9 =20*224 + (-14)*76 + (-610)\n\n20*224=4480; -14*76= -1064; total:4480-1064=3416; 3416 -610=2806.\n\nSo depending on the a,b,c chosen, the next terms can be different. Since the problem didn't specify more terms, it's impossible to know which is correct. However, since the problem only requires existence, any such recurrence is acceptable. Therefore, the answer is that a linear recurrence with constant term exists (e.g., k_n = -8k_{n-1}+13k_{n-2}+195), so the sequence can be extended with that.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that without a constant term, no integer solution exists, but with a constant, it does. Since the problem first asked about Fibonacci-like (without constant), but since that's not possible, but with constant it is. Since the user also mentions predicting k15, k16, so likely they are okay with the constant term.\n\nThus, the final answer is that such a recurrence exists with constants, for example the one with a=-8, b=13, c=195. The problem didn't specify to provide the coefficients, just to determine existence. Since the user instruction was to answer within boxed, likely expects to state the answer as existence, but maybe the question is to find a,b,c?\n\nWait, re-reading the original problem:\n\n\"F: Can we find a, b such that k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\n\nFor k7 = 76:\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n224 = 76a + 49b\"\n\nSo the user is asking specifically for a and b (without constant term). Since the user then also says \"if there's a recurrence, we can predict...\". Since without constant term, there are no integer solutions, so the answer would be no, but with the constant term, it is yes. However, the user's initial question is only about a and b (without c). Therefore, the answer to the question as posed is that there are no integers a and b that satisfy the equations, so the Fibonacci-like recurrence without constant term is not possible, but with a constant term it is possible. Since the problem specifically asks for a and b (i.e., without constant), the answer is no. Wait, but the user might have intended to allow a constant term? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous.\n\nLooking back, the original problem says: \"Can we find a, b such that k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\"\n\nSo strictly, it's asking for a linear recurrence of order 2 without constant term. Since that requires solving the system:\n\n49a +21b =76\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nWe can solve this system for a and b.\n\nLet me try solving the two equations:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me write them as:\n\n49a +21b =76 --> multiply by 76: 49*76 a +21*76 b =76*76\n\n76a +49b =224 --> multiply by 49:76*49 a +49^2 b =224*49\n\nThen subtract equations to eliminate a?\n\nAlternatively, use linear algebra.\n\nLet me write the system:\n\n49a +21b =76 --> divide by 7: 7a +3b =76/7 \u224810.857...\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nHmm, but fractions complicate. Alternatively, use elimination.\n\nMultiply first equation by 49 and second by21:\n\nEquation1 *49: 49*49 a + 21*49 b =76*49\n\nEquation2 *21:76*21 a +49*21 b=224*21\n\nSubtract equation1*49 - equation2*21:\n\n[49\u00b2 -76*21]a + [21*49 -49*21]b =76*49 -224*21\n\nThe b terms cancel (21*49 -49*21=0)\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\nFor a: (49\u00b2 -76*21)*a =76*49 -224*21\n\nCompute 49\u00b2 =2401, 76*21=1596, so 2401-1596=805\n\nRHS:76*49 =3724; 224*21=4704 \u2192 3724 -4704= -980\n\nThus 805a = -980 \u2192 a= -980/805 = simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 35: 980 \u00f735=28, 805 \u00f735=23. So a= -28/23.\n\nThen substitute back into first equation:\n\n49*(-28/23) +21b=76 \u2192 -1372/23 +21b =76 \u219221b=76 +1372/23= (76*23 +1372)/23= (1748 +1372)/23=3120/23 \u2192 b= (3120/23)/21=3120/(23*21)= 3120/483= divide numerator and denominator by 3: 1040/161\u22486.46.\n\nSo indeed, a and b are fractions, so no integer solutions. Therefore, the answer to the original question (without constant term) is that there are no integers a and b. But with a constant term, there are, as shown.\n\nSince the user's first question is about a and b (without constant term), the answer is no, but since they also mentioned predicting further terms, maybe they accept the constant term version. But strictly following the question as asked, since it specifies \"a, b\" without mentioning a constant, the answer is that there are no integer solutions for a and b. But in the initial problem, the user might have intended to allow a constant term, given the follow-up about predicting terms.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but the problem specifically says \"Can we find a, b such that...\", the answer is no. However, since the user included the part about predicting k15, k16, which is possible with the constant term recurrence, perhaps the intended answer is to present the recurrence with a,b,c, but since the question is only about a and b, maybe the problem expects to state that it's not possible without a constant term but possible with one, but since the user instruction says to put the final answer within boxed{} probably the numerical values for a,b,c but since the question asks for a,b only, which are non-integer, but the problem might have a typo or expects real numbers?\n\nWait, the problem didn't specify that a and b have to be integers. Maybe they just want real numbers? In that case, a= -28/23\u2248-1.217, and b\u22486.46. But given that the problem is presented with all terms as integers, likely expects integer coefficients. Since it's common in such problems to look for integer coefficients, so likely the answer is that there are no integers a and b, but with a constant term, there are. But how to present this in boxed?\n\nThe problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". If the question is strictly whether a and b exist (without constant term), then the answer is no, but since boxed usually expects a mathematical answer, maybe they want the values of a and b even if fractional? Or perhaps the question assumes a constant term and wants a,b,c?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have an error and the equations have integer solutions. Let me check the equations again:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b =76 \u2192 divide by 7: 7a +3b =76/7. Hmm, 76 isn't divisible by 7, so no.\n\nEquation2:76a +49b=224 \u2192 Let me see 76a +49b=224. Maybe possible mod something?\n\nTake mod7:\n\n76 mod7: 76-10*7=76-70=6 \u2192 6a mod7\n\n49 mod7=0, so 0*b=0 mod7\n\nThus equation2 mod7:6a \u2261224 mod7 \u2192224 mod7: 224-32*7=224-224=0. So 6a\u22610 mod7 \u21926a\u22610 mod7 \u2192a\u22610 mod7 (since 6 and7 coprime). So a=7k.\n\nPlug into equation1:49*(7k)+21b=76 \u2192343k +21b=76. 343k must be less than 76, so k=0 \u219221b=76\u2192b=76/21. Not integer. Thus no solution.\n\nTherefore, strictly no solution. Thus the answer is no, but since the user might expect the answer with constant term, but the question didn't ask for that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculations?\n\nWait, in the problem statement:\n\n\"For k7 =76:\n\n76 = a\u00d749 +b\u00d721\n\nFor k8=224:\n\n224 =a\u00d776 +b\u00d749\"\n\nYes, so equations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo in numbers? If k7 was 76, but let's see:\n\nSuppose the equations were 49a +21b=76 and 76a +49b=224, then solving:\n\nLet me use matrix method:\n\nThe system is:\n\n49a +21b =76\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nThe determinant is 49*49 -21*76=2401 -1596=805\n\nThe a numerator: 76*49 -21*224= 3724 -4704= -980 \u2192 a= -980/805= -28/23\n\nSimilarly b numerator:49*224 -76*76= 10976 -5776=5200 \u21925200/805= divide numerator and denominator by5: 1040/161\u22486.46\n\nSo indeed fractions. So no integer solutions.\n\nThus the answer is that there are no integers a and b satisfying the equations. Since the problem asks \"Can we find a, b...\", the answer is no. But the user instruction says to put the final answer in boxed{}.\n\nPerhaps the question expects to present the values of a and b as fractions, boxed? Like \\boxed{a = -\\dfrac{28}{23}}, \\boxed{b = \\dfrac{1040}{161}}? But the question says \"Can we find a,b...\", so the answer is \"No\", but in boxed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from somewhere else and expects different approach? Maybe I made a mistake in interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps \"k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}\" could be with different indices? Like maybe k_7 is expressed via previous terms? The problem states \"For k7 =76: 76 =a\u00d749 +b\u00d721\", so that implies that k_7 = a\u00d7k_6 +b\u00d7k_5, where k_6=49 and k_5=21? Similarly for k8=224= a\u00d7k7 +b\u00d7k6= a\u00d776 +b\u00d749. So the previous terms are k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224. Then the equations are correct.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that there are no integer a and b, so the answer is no. Since the user might expect this, and in the problem's context, perhaps the question allows real numbers, but since boxed usually for numbers, but since it's a yes/no question, but the system might expect to write \"No\" in boxed? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to write the values in fraction form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check once more:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"F: Can we find a, b such that k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\n\nFor k7 =76:\n\n76 =a\u00d749 +b\u00d721\n\nFor k8=224:\n\n224 =a\u00d776 +b\u00d749\"\n\nYes, so equations are correct, leading to non-integer a and b. So answer is no. But how to present this in boxed{}?\n\nPerhaps the problem assumes that we can write the answer as the values of a and b as fractions:\n\na = -28/23 and b = 1040/161\n\nThus, boxed:\n\na = \\boxed{-\\dfrac{28}{23}}, b = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1040}{161}}\n\nBut the question didn't specify to box each, maybe box both together? Not sure. Alternatively, the problem might have a different approach? Like maybe the user made a typo in the numbers?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial terms are different. For instance, if k5= 21, k6=49, then k7= a\u00d749 +b\u00d721=76, and k8= a\u00d776 +b\u00d749=224.\n\nSuppose the user intended different prior terms? Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equations are to be solved for integers:\n\nLooking for integers a,b:\n\n49a +21b =76\n\nLet me write 49a =76 -21b\n\nSo 49a \u226176 mod21 \u219249 mod21=7, so 7a \u226176 mod21\n\n76 mod21: 21*3=63, 76-63=13 \u21927a\u226113 mod21\n\nMultiply both sides by inverse of7 mod21. Since 7 and21 not coprime, inverse doesn't exist. So equation 7a \u226113 mod21\n\nThis equation has solution only if gcd(7,21) divides13. gcd(7,21)=7, but 7 doesn't divide13. Thus no solution. Hence no solution in integers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that there are no integers a and b satisfying the equations. Therefore, the answer is no, which would be written as \\boxed{\\text{No}} but since the system might want numerical answers, maybe just stating the impossibility.\n\nGiven the problem's phrasing, I think the intended answer is that there are no integer solutions, so the final answer is \\boxed{\\text{No}}. However, since some may expect the fractional values, but given the context of integer sequences, likely \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n\nBut I need to check instructions again: the user wrote \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". If it's a yes/no question, maybe boxed{No}, but in math problems often boxed numbers are expected. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the user considers that the equations can be scaled?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct k7 and k8 would allow integer solutions. For example, if k8 was 225 instead of224, let's see:\n\nIf equation2 was 76a +49b=225,\n\nthen determinant same 805,\n\na= (76*49 -21*225)/805= (3724 -4725)/805= (-1001)/805= -143/115,\n\nstill not integer.\n\nAlternatively, if k7 was 77:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b=77 \u2192 divide by7:7a+3b=11,\n\nEquation2:76a +49b=224,\n\nThen solving:\n\n7a +3b=11\n\n76a +49b=224\n\nMultiply first by7:49a +21b=77\n\nSecond equation:76a +49b=224\n\nMultiply first by49: 49*(49a +21b)=49*77 \u21922401a +1029b=3773\n\nMultiply second by21:21*(76a +49b)=21*224 \u21921596a +1029b=4704\n\nSubtract first from second:\n\n(1596a -2401a) + (1029b-1029b)=4704-3773 \u2192-805a=931 \u2192a= -931/805= -133/115, still not integer.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, if k7= 70, k8= something?\n\nThis trial and error is not effective. Given the original numbers, the answer is no.\n\nThus, the answer is \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n\nWait but the initial problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", and often in math problems, if it's a value, you put the number inside. But since it's a yes/no question, maybe the problem expects to write the values even if fractional, so boxed fractions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed something. Let me see:\n\nWait, maybe the equations are 49a +21b =76 and76a +49b=224.\n\nLet me try to solve for a and b:\n\nFrom first equation:49a =76 -21b \u2192a=(76 -21b)/49\n\nSubstitute into second equation:\n\n76*(76 -21b)/49 +49b =224\n\nMultiply all terms by49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49*49b =224*49\n\nCompute each term:\n\n76*76 =5776\n\n76*(-21b)= -1596b\n\n49*49b=2401b\n\n224*49=10976\n\nThus:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b =10976\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2401b -1596b) +5776 =10976 \u2192805b =10976 -5776=5200 \u2192b=5200/805= divide numerator and denominator by5: 1040/161\u22486.46\n\nThen a=(76 -21*(1040/161))/49\n\nCompute 21*(1040/161)= (21*1040)/161= (21960)/161= 21960 divided by161:\n\n161*136= 161*(100+36)=16100 +5796=21896\n\n21960-21896=64 \u219221960/161=136 +64/161\n\nThus, 76 - that is:\n\n76 = (76*161)/161= 12236/161\n\nSo 12236/161 -21960/161= (12236-21960)/161= (-9724)/161\n\nThus a= (-9724/161)/49= -9724/(161*49)= -9724/7889\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by GCD(9724,7889):\n\nCompute GCD(7889,9724)\n\n9724 \u00f77889=1 R 1835\n\n7889 \u00f71835=4 R 549\n\n1835 \u00f7549=3 R 248\n\n549 \u00f7248=2 R 53\n\n248 \u00f753=4 R 40\n\n53 \u00f740=1 R 13\n\n40 \u00f713=3 R 1\n\n13 \u00f71=13 R0 \u2192 GCD=1\n\nThus a= -9724/7889 \u2248-1.233\n\nSo the fractions are reduced, but not integers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, so boxed as \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n\nBut I need to confirm the problem's exact requirement. Since it says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", and in math problems usually answers are numbers. Since there is no solution, maybe the problem expects to write \"No solution\" in a box? Or perhaps the question is to express a and b as fractions, then boxed each.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misunderstood the problem's request. The user wrote:\n\n\"F: Can we find a, b such that k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\n\nFor k7 =76:\n\n76 =a\u00d749 +b\u00d721\n\nFor k8=224:\n\n224 =a\u00d776 +b\u00d749\"\n\nSo it's two equations with two unknowns, so solving for a and b gives the fractions above. If the problem allows real numbers, then the solution is those fractions. Since the user didn't specify integer, but in the context of such problems, often integer coefficients are expected for linear recursions with integer terms. Since they aren't integers, maybe the answer is that it's impossible, so \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the problem wants the values of a and b expressed as reduced fractions, then:\n\na = -28/23 and b = 1040/161.\n\nSo, boxed individually:\n\na = \\boxed{ -\\dfrac{28}{23} }, b = \\boxed{ \\dfrac{1040}{161} }\n\nBut the question says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", implying a single box. Maybe present as a pair:\n\n\\boxed{ \\left( -\\dfrac{28}{23}, \\dfrac{1040}{161} \\right) }\n\nSince the user might expect this.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different approach. Maybe the user is to find a and b such that the recurrence holds for the given terms, and the answer is those fractions.\n\nConsidering that the question didn't specify integers, the answer is those fractions. So probably expected to write them boxed.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\na = \\boxed{ -\\dfrac{28}{23} }, b = \\boxed{ \\dfrac{1040}{161} }\n\nBut since the user might want both in one box:\n\n\\boxed{ \\left( -\\dfrac{28}{23}, \\dfrac{1040}{161} \\right) }\n\nBut I'll check with the problem's context. If it's a standard linear recurrence, usually presented with fractions if necessary. Given the system's requirement, I think this is the way.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are \\boxed{-\\dfrac{28}{23}} and \\boxed{\\dfrac{1040}{161}} respectively.\n\nAlternatively, if paired:\n\n\\boxed{ \\left( -\\dfrac{28}{23}, \\dfrac{1040}{161} \\right) }\n\nBut since the user might expect two boxed answers, I'll present them separately.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\( a = \\boxed{-\\dfrac{28}{23}} \\) and \\( b = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1040}{161}} \\)\n",
