  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence, which means checking if there exist constants a and b such that each term k_n is equal to a times the previous term plus b times the term before that. The problem gives me two equations based on k7 = 76 and k8 = 224. Let me write them down again:\n\nFirst equation from k7: 76 = 49a + 21b\n\nSecond equation from k8: 224 = 76a + 49b\n\nHmm, I need to solve this system of equations for a and b. Let me see. Since these are linear equations, I can use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is better here because the coefficients are a bit messy. Let me try elimination.\n\nLet me label the equations for clarity:\n\nEquation 1: 49a + 21b = 76\n\nEquation 2: 76a + 49b = 224\n\nI can try to eliminate one of the variables. Let's try to eliminate 'a' first. To do that, I can multiply Equation 1 by 76 and Equation 2 by 49 so that the coefficients of 'a' will be the same, then subtract them. Wait, but that might lead to large numbers. Alternatively, maybe find the least common multiple of 49 and 76? Hmm, that might be complicated. Let's see another way.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to solve for one variable in terms of the other from Equation 1 and substitute into Equation 2.\n\nFrom Equation 1: 49a + 21b = 76\n\nLet me solve for a:\n\n49a = 76 - 21b\n\nSo,\n\na = (76 - 21b)/49\n\nHmm, but fractions might be messy. Alternatively, solve for b?\n\n21b = 76 - 49a\n\nb = (76 - 49a)/21\n\nHmm, still fractions. Maybe plugging into Equation 2 would work, even with fractions.\n\nLet me substitute a from the first equation into the second equation.\n\nSo, in Equation 2: 76a + 49b = 224\n\nReplace a with (76 -21b)/49:\n\n76*( (76 -21b)/49 ) + 49b = 224\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 76*(76 -21b)/49 + 49b = 224\n\nLet me compute 76 divided by 49 first. 76/49 is approximately 1.551, but maybe keep it as fractions.\n\nSo, (76*76 - 76*21b)/49 + 49b = 224\n\nWait, actually, it's better to write all terms over 49 denominator perhaps?\n\nWait, let me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: 76*(76 -21b)/49 = (76*76 - 76*21b)/49\n\nSecond term: 49b is the same as (49b *49)/49? Wait no, to combine with the first term, I need a common denominator.\n\nAlternatively, multiply both sides of the equation by 49 to eliminate denominators.\n\nLet me do that. Multiply everything by 49:\n\n76*(76 -21b) + 49b*49 = 224*49\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me go back:\n\nOriginal substitution:\n\n76*( (76 -21b)/49 ) +49b =224\n\nMultiply all terms by 49 to eliminate denominator:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49b*49 =224*49\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 76*(76 -21b) = 76*76 -76*21b\n\nSecond term: 49b*49 = 49^2 b = 2401b\n\nThird term: 224*49 = let's compute that. 224*50 would be 11200, minus 224 gives 11200 -224=10976.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n76^2 -76*21b +2401b =10976\n\nFirst compute 76^2: 76*76. Let's see, 70^2=4900, 6^2=36, and cross term 2*70*6=840. So (70+6)^2 = 4900 +840 +36= 5776. So 76^2 is 5776.\n\nThen, -76*21b: 76*21 is 76*20 +76*1 =1520 +76=1596. So that term is -1596b.\n\nSo combining the terms with b:\n\n-1596b +2401b = (2401 -1596)b = 805b\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n5776 +805b =10976\n\nSubtract 5776 from both sides:\n\n805b =10976 -5776 =5200\n\nTherefore, b =5200 /805\n\nLet me simplify this fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n5200 \u00f75=1040\n\n805 \u00f75=161\n\nSo b =1040/161\n\nHmm, 1040 divided by 161. Let me see if 161 divides into 1040 evenly?\n\n161*6=966, 1040-966=74. So 161*6 +74=1040, so not an integer. Hmm, that's a problem. Since the question is asking for integer a and b, right? The user mentioned \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So if b is a fraction, then that suggests there are no integer solutions. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check my steps again.\n\nStarting again from substitution:\n\nEquation 1: 49a +21b =76\n\nEquation 2:76a +49b =224\n\nExpress a from Equation1: a=(76-21b)/49\n\nSubstitute into Equation2:\n\n76*(76 -21b)/49 +49b =224\n\nMultiply all terms by 49:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49*49b =224*49\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term:76*76=5776, 76*(-21b)= -1596b, so 5776 -1596b\n\nSecond term:49*49b=2401b\n\nThird term:224*49=10976\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b =10976\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n5776 + (2401b -1596b)=10976\n\n2401-1596=805, so 805b\n\nThus, 5776 +805b=10976\n\nSubtract 5776:\n\n805b=10976-5776=5200\n\nSo b=5200/805. Let me see if that reduces further.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5 gives 1040/161 as before. Let me check 161 factors: 161 is 7*23, right? 7*23=161. Let me check 1040 divided by 7: 1040/7=148.571... Not integer. 1040 divided by 23: 23*45=1035, so 1040-1035=5, so 45 and 5/23. So no, doesn't divide evenly. So b is a fraction, so no integer solution here. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach with elimination.\n\nLet me take the two equations:\n\n49a +21b =76 ...(1)\n\n76a +49b =224 ...(2)\n\nLet me try to eliminate 'b' instead. Let's multiply Equation1 by 49 and Equation2 by21, so that the coefficients of b become 21*49 and 49*21, so same.\n\nMultiply Equation1 by49:\n\n49*(49a) +49*(21b)=49*76\n\nWhich is 49\u00b2a + 1029b = 3724\n\nMultiply Equation2 by21:\n\n21*76a +21*49b=21*224\n\nWhich is 1596a + 1029b=4704\n\nNow subtract the first new equation from the second:\n\n(1596a +1029b) - (49\u00b2a +1029b) =4704 -3724\n\nCompute left side:\n\n1596a - (49\u00b2)a + (1029b -1029b)= 4704-3724\n\nSimplify:\n\n[1596 -2401]a = 980\n\nBecause 49\u00b2 is 2401, yes.\n\nSo 1596 -2401 = -805\n\nTherefore: -805a =980\n\nSo a= 980 / (-805)= -980/805\n\nSimplify this fraction. Divide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n980 \u00f75=196; 805 \u00f75=161\n\nSo a= -196/161\n\nAgain, this is a fraction, so that's a problem. Since a is also a fraction, this again suggests that there are no integer solutions for a and b.\n\nHmm, so according to this, there is no integer a and b that satisfy both equations. Therefore, the sequence does not follow a linear recurrence of the form k_n = a k_{n-1} +b k_{n-2} with integer coefficients.\n\nWait a second, but maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe user says: \"For k7 =76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721; For k8=224: 224 =a\u00d776 +b\u00d749\".\n\nAssuming that prior terms are known. Let me confirm if that's the case. So k7 is given as 76, which is based on k6 and k5. Wait, but the user didn't provide the previous terms, so maybe the problem is presented with the assumption that k5, k6 are known?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in a recurrence relation like k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2}, to compute k7, we need k6 and k5, right? Similarly, to compute k8, we need k7 and k6. But in the equations given by the user, for k7, they used 49 and 21. Wait, perhaps 49 is k6 and 21 is k5? So maybe k6 is 49, k5 is 21, then k7 is 76, and k8 is 224. So then the equations are correct as given.\n\nBut then the question is whether there exists integers a and b such that 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721 and 224 =a\u00d776 +b\u00d749. So if that's the case, then solving these equations gives non-integer solutions, so the answer would be no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me check the equations again with possible a and b.\n\nSuppose a and b are fractions. Let me see what they are exactly.\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\nFrom first approach:\n\nb=5200 /805 \u22486.46\n\nFrom the second approach, a= -196/161\u2248-1.217\n\nWait, that seems odd. Let me verify with substitution.\n\nSuppose a= -196/161 and b= 5200/805. Let me see if these satisfy the first equation.\n\nFirst equation:49a +21b\n\n49*(-196/161) +21*(5200/805)\n\nSimplify:\n\n49/161= (49)/(161)= 7/23 (since 161=23*7)\n\nSo 49a= -196/161 *49= wait, no, 49*( -196/161 ) = (-49*196)/161. Let me compute 49 divides into 161: 161=7*23, so 49 is 7\u00b2, so 49 and 161 share a common factor of 7.\n\nSo 49*( -196)/161 = (49/7)*( -196/23 ) =7*( -196/23 )\n\nWait, this might not be the easiest way. Alternatively, let's compute 49a:\n\n49*(-196/161)= (49*(-196))/161\n\nBut 49*196 =49*196, let me compute that:\n\n49*200 =9800, so 49*(200-4)= 9800 - 49*4 =9800 -196=9604\n\nSo 49a= -9604/161\n\nSimilarly, 21b=21*(5200/805)= (21*5200)/805\n\nSimplify 21 and 805: 805 divided by 5 is 161, 21 and 161 have a common factor of 7: 21=3*7, 161=23*7, so gcd(21,805)=7\n\nThus, 21/805=3/115, so 21*(5200)/805= (21/805)*5200 = (3/115)*5200\n\n3*5200=15600, so 15600/115 = let's divide 15600 \u00f7115:\n\n115*135=15525, 15600-15525=75, so 135 + 75/115=135.652...\n\nHmm, but let me check 49a +21b:\n\n-9604/161 +15600/115\n\nWait, this is getting too messy. Maybe just compute numerically.\n\nCompute a \u2248-1.217 and b\u22486.46\n\n49a \u224849*(-1.217)\u2248-60\n\n21b\u224821*6.46\u2248135.66\n\nAdding together: -60 +135.66\u224875.66, which is close to 76. Hmm, so maybe rounding errors, but with fractions, they should add exactly. Let me see:\n\nWait, let me check if 5200/805 and -196/161 are exact.\n\nWait 5200 divided by 805: Let's see 805*6=4830, 5200-4830=370, 805*0.46= approx 370.3, so yes, exactly 5200/805= (5200 \u00f75)/(805 \u00f75)=1040/161, so 1040 divided by 161 is exactly 6.46 approximately.\n\nSimilarly, -196/161 is exactly -1.217 approximately.\n\nBut when we plug into 49a +21b:\n\n49*(-196/161) +21*(5200/805)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 49*(-196)/161\n\n49/161 = 7/23, so 7/23 * (-196)= 7*(-196)/23 = -1372/23\n\nSecond term:21*(5200)/805\n\n21/805 = 3/115, so 3/115 *5200= (3*5200)/115=15600/115= 135.652...\n\nWait, but 15600 divided by 115:\n\n115*135=15525, 15600-15525=75, so 75/115=15/23, so total 135 +15/23= (135*23 +15)/23= (3105+15)/23=3120/23\n\nSo second term is 3120/23.\n\nThus total first term + second term is (-1372 +3120)/23= (1748)/23=76.\n\nBecause 23*76= 23*(70+6)= 1610+138=1748. Yes!\n\nSo indeed, 49a +21b=76, as required.\n\nSimilarly for the second equation:\n\n76a +49b.\n\nCompute 76*(-196/161) +49*(5200/805)\n\nFirst term:\n\n76*(-196)/161. 76/161 is 76/(7*23). Hmm. Let's see:\n\n76*(-196)/161 = (76/161)*(-196). Let's note that 76 and 161: 161=23*7, 76=19*4, so no common factors. So 76/161 is as simplified.\n\nSecond term:49*(5200)/805 =49*(5200)/805. Since 49 and 805 share a factor of 7: 805=7*115, so 49=7*7, so 49/805=7/(115). Thus:\n\n49*(5200)/805 = (7/115)*5200= 36400/115= 316.521...\n\nWait, let's compute exactly:\n\nFirst term:76*(-196)/161 = (76*(-196))/161\n\nSecond term:49*(5200)/805 = (49*5200)/805\n\nLet me compute first term:\n\n76*(-196)= -14896\n\nSo first term: -14896/161\n\nSecond term: 49*5200=254800; 254800/805. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 5: 254800/5=50960; 805/5=161\n\nThus, second term is 50960/161.\n\nThus total: (-14896 +50960)/161 = (36064)/161.\n\nCompute 36064 divided by161:\n\n161*224= 161*(200+24)= 32200 + 3864= 36064. Exactly.\n\nThus, 36064/161=224, which matches the second equation.\n\nSo the fractions work, but they are not integers. So unless the problem allows fractions, but the question says \"F: Please reason step by step...\", but in the problem statement, the user didn't specify if a and b have to be integers. Wait, looking back at the original problem:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"F: Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nF: Please...\"\n\nWait, the problem as presented here might not have been fully transcribed. The initial instruction is just \"Please reason...\", but maybe the original problem was in Chinese, and the user is translating? Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is to determine whether such a recurrence exists (with real coefficients?) but given that k5, k6, etc., are integers, and the user is asking if such a recurrence with integer coefficients exists?\n\nAssuming that the problem is asking for integer coefficients a and b, then the answer is no, there are no such integers. Therefore, the sequence does not follow a linear recurrence of that form with integer coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows real coefficients, in which case the answer would be yes, but the question likely expects integer coefficients, given that the terms are integers and the equations set up with them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo in the numbers? Let me check the equations again:\n\nFor k7 =76, using k6=49 and k5=21,\n\n76 =a*49 + b*21,\n\nFor k8=224, using k7=76 and k6=49,\n\n224 =a*76 +b*49.\n\nWait, perhaps if we consider that maybe k6 is not 49? Wait, but the user says \"For k7=76: 76 =a\u00d749 +b\u00d721\", so they are assuming that k6=49 and k5=21. If those prior terms are correct, then the equations are set as such.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in another context where coefficients don't have to be integers, but the question is probably expecting to say that there is no such integer pair a,b. So the answer is no, which would be expressed as \"No such integers exist\", but in the required format, maybe boxed as \\boxed{No} or similar. But the user instructions say \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", which is typically for numerical answers. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find a and b, but since they are fractions, maybe present them as fractions?\n\nWait, going back to the original problem, perhaps there was more context. Since the user input is a bit unclear. The initial problem might have been in Chinese, and the user is translating, so perhaps there's more to it. Alternatively, maybe the question is to find a and b, and since they are fractions, the answer should be expressed as fractions.\n\nLooking at the two equations:\n\n49a +21b =76,\n\n76a +49b =224.\n\nWe can solve this system.\n\nLet me write equations:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76,\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224.\n\nLet me solve for a and b.\n\nMultiply Equation1 by 49 and Equation2 by21 to eliminate b:\n\nEquation1*49:49*49a +21*49b =76*49,\n\nEquation2*21:76*21a +49*21b=224*21,\n\nSo:\n\nEquation1*49:2401a + 1029b = 3724,\n\nEquation2*21:1596a +1029b = 4704,\n\nSubtract Equation1*49 - Equation2*21:\n\n(2401a -1596a) + (1029b -1029b)=3724 -4704,\n\n805a = -980,\n\nSo a= -980/805 = -196/161\u2248-1.217.\n\nThen plug back a into Equation1:\n\n49*(-196/161) +21b =76,\n\nCompute 49*(-196)/161= (49/161)*(-196)= (7/23)*(-196)= -1372/23,\n\nSo,\n\n-1372/23 +21b =76,\n\n21b=76 +1372/23,\n\nConvert 76 to 76*23/23=1748/23,\n\nThus 21b=(1748 +1372)/23=3120/23,\n\nThus b= (3120/23)/21=3120/(23*21)=3120/483= 1040/161\u22486.46.\n\nSo a= -196/161, b=1040/161.\n\nIf the question is asking for the values of a and b, they would be fractions. So boxed as:\n\na= \\boxed{-\\dfrac{196}{161}}, b= \\boxed{\\dfrac{1040}{161}}.\n\nBut since the user might have intended integer coefficients, but since it's not specified, maybe present the fractions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an error in the problem's numbers. For instance, if the second equation were 224 = a*76 + b*49, then with a and b fractions as above, but if the numbers were different, maybe integers could work. Alternatively, maybe the question is to see if such a recurrence exists (with real coefficients), in which case the answer is yes, but presented as fractions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be part of a system where you need to find a and b, and the question is to compute one of them, but the user hasn't specified. Given the ambiguity, but following the initial equations given, the solution requires a and b as fractions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to see if there's a common ratio or something else, but given the way the equations are set up, it's a linear system.\n\nGiven that the user instruction is to put the final answer in a box, and since the problem might have been to find a and b, I think the expected answer is the values of a and b, so boxed fractions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find a+b or something, but without instructions, it's hard to tell. Since the user just says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", perhaps the problem is as presented in Chinese, and the key point is that there is no integer solution, so the answer is \"No\", but in Chinese contexts sometimes even fractional solutions are acceptable.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated? Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me try solving the equations again.\n\nEquation1:49a +21b=76,\n\nEquation2:76a +49b=224.\n\nLet me use the elimination method.\n\nMultiply Equation1 by 49: 49*(49a) +49*21b =49*76,\n\nMultiply Equation2 by21:21*76a +21*49b=21*224,\n\nSo:\n\nEquation1:2401a +1029b =3724,\n\nEquation2:1596a +1029b=4704,\n\nSubtract Equation1 - Equation2:\n\n(2401a-1596a)+(1029b-1029b)=3724-4704,\n\n805a= -980,\n\nThus a= -980/805= divide numerator and denominator by 5: -196/161. So yes, that's correct.\n\nThen plug into Equation1:\n\n49a +21b=76,\n\n49*(-196/161) +21b=76,\n\nCalculating 49*(-196)/161:\n\n49 divides by 49: 49/161=1/ (161/49)= 1/(23/7) \u2192 Wait, 161=23*7, so 49/161=7/23,\n\nThus 49*(-196)/161= (7/23)*(-196)= -1372/23,\n\nThus,\n\n-1372/23 +21b =76,\n\n21b=76 +1372/23,\n\nConvert 76 to over 23: 76*23=1748,\n\nThus 21b= (1748 +1372)/23 =3120/23,\n\nThus b= (3120/23)/21= 3120/(23*21)=3120/483,\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 1040/161. So that's correct.\n\nThus the solution is a= -196/161, b=1040/161.\n\nSince the problem might expect writing both in boxed form, but the user instruction is to put the final answer in one box. Maybe it's a system of equations, so present both?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be to find a particular value, but given the ambiguity, perhaps the user intended to ask for the existence with integer coefficients, so the answer is no, boxed as \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is in Chinese and the user is translating, maybe the question is to find the next term in the sequence, but with the given info, you can compute it using a and b.\n\nLet me see, if we have a linear recurrence like x_{n} = a x_{n-1} + b x_{n-2}, then given k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, then k8 would be a*76 +b*49=224 (which matches the given k8=224), so the next term would be a*224 +b*76.\n\nBut without being asked, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is presented as \"F: Please reason...\", maybe the original problem was in Chinese and the user is asking for the solution steps, and the final answer is the values of a and b boxed.\n\nIn many math problems, when coefficients are fractions, they are presented in reduced form.\n\n-196/161 can be simplified? Let's see:\n\nGCD of 196 and 161. 161 divides by 7? 7*23=161, 196 is 49*4=7^2*2^2. So GCD is 7.\n\nThus -196/161= -28/23,\n\nSimilarly 1040/161: 1040 divided by 7 is 148.57, so no. 161 is 7\u00d723, 1040 divided by 7 is 148.57, so not integer. So 1040/161 reduces to 1040/161. Wait 1040 divided by 23 is 45.217, so no. So simplest form is -28/23 and 1040/161?\n\nWait 1040 divided by 7 is 148.571, so 1040/161= (1040/7)/23= 148.571/23, but not helpful.\n\nWait 1040 and 161:\n\nFind GCD(1040,161). 161 divides into 1040 how many times?\n\n161*6=966, 1040-966=74.\n\nGCD(161,74). 74 divides into 161 twice (148), remainder 13.\n\nGCD(74,13). 13*5=65, remainder 9.\n\nGCD(13,9). 9*1=9, remainder4.\n\nGCD(9,4). 4*2=8, remainder1.\n\nGCD(4,1)=1.\n\nThus GCD is1. So 1040/161 is reduced.\n\nWait but 1040 divided by 8 is 130, 161 is odd, so no. Thus the fractions are simplified as -28/23 and 1040/161.\n\nWait 196 divided by 7 is28, 161 divided by7 is23, so -196/161 simplifies to -28/23.\n\nYes! I missed that. So -196/161= - (196/161)= divide numerator and denominator by7: 196/7=28, 161/7=23. Thus -28/23.\n\nSimilarly 1040/161: 1040 divided by7=148.571, so can't reduce further. So the simplified forms are a= -28/23 and b=1040/161.\n\nThus the solutions are a= \\boxed{ -\\dfrac{28}{23} }, b= \\boxed{ \\dfrac{1040}{161} }.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects them as a single boxed pair? But standard practice is separate boxes if multiple answers. Since the user instruction is to put the final answer within a single box, perhaps as an ordered pair?\n\nThe problem might have been to solve for a and b, so the answer is those two fractions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a miscalculation, but given the user's input, these are the solutions.\n\nSince I have to choose, and given the user might have intended to ask for the values of a and b, I will present them boxed as above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question was to find the next term, but since it's not stated, I can't assume.\n\nGiven the information, the solution to the system is a= -28/23 and b=1040/161. Thus I will present both boxed.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for the coefficients \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the recurrence relation \\(x_n = a x_{n-1} + b x_{n-2}\\) given the terms \\(x_5 = 21\\), \\(x_6 = 49\\), \\(x_7 = 76\\), and \\(x_8 = 224\\), we set up the following system of equations based on \\(x_7\\) and \\(x_8\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n49a + 21b = 76 \\quad \\text{(from } x_7 \\text{)} \\\\\n76a + 49b = 224 \\quad \\text{(from } x_8 \\text{)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 49 and the second by 21 to align coefficients:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n2401a + 1029b = 3724 \\\\\n1596a + 1029b = 4704\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \\(b\\):**\n\n\\[\n(2401a - 1596a) + (1029b - 1029b) = 3724 - 4704 \\\\\n805a = -980 \\\\\na = \\frac{-980}{805} = \\frac{-196}{161} = \\frac{-28}{23}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Substitute \\(a = -\\frac{28}{23}\\) back into the first equation to solve for \\(b\\):**\n\n\\[\n49\\left(-\\frac{28}{23}\\right) + 21b = 76 \\\\\n-\\frac{1372}{23} + 21b = 76 \\\\\n21b = 76 + \\frac{1372}{23} \\\\\n21b = \\frac{1748}{23} + \\frac{1372}{23} \\\\\n21b = \\frac{3120}{23} \\\\\nb = \\frac{3120}{23 \\times 21} = \\frac{1040}{161}\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficients are:\n\n\\[\na = \\boxed{-\\dfrac{28}{23}}, \\quad b = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1040}{161}}\n\\]",
