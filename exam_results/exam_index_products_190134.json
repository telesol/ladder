It appears the user has observed a pattern involving indices, products etc. Let me restate problem in my own words: There is some sequence of values k_n, and apparently there is an underlying formula for these k_n that sometimes can be represented as f(n)*n + g(n), where f and g are functions of n, presumably integers.\n\nWe have observations:\n- For key 2: k2. But not provided directly maybe? The pattern \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" is given, but then later it's used in some formulas.\n- There are check numbers for keys 7,8,9,11,12, etc.\n\nLet me re-read the content carefully:\n\nIt says:\nINDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711.\n\nIs there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)?\n\nCalculate f(n) for each key.\n\nWe need to compute f(n) presumably for keys: maybe 2,3,... Actually, let me re-read the original message. It says:\n\"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So we are asked to find f(n) where k_n = f(n)*n + g(n).\n\nI wonder if there's a known sequence \"k_n\". They mention \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\", so perhaps these keys are part of a puzzle or number theory challenge. Possibly it could be related to some product representation that might come from the factorial of n or something.\n\nObservations:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3: That implies maybe we have a recurrence relation involving multiplication for some indices? But then they mention \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\", which is not multiplicative but subtracting five. They then check values:\n   For key7: \"76/7 = 10.86\" suggests that if you do something like (k7 /7) it's not an integer. For key8: (224/8=28), so f(8)=28, and for key9, (467/9 ~51.89) not an integer; for key11, 1155/11 =105 which is an integer; for key12, (2683 / 12 =223.5833...) but note that  k8\u00d712 - 5= 28 * 12 - 5 = 336-5=331? Wait check: Actually they say \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\", then they compute that equals 2683, so 28*12 would be 336, but 336-5=331. That doesn't equal 2683. Let me re-read: \n\"5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". Wait that's weird, if k8 is 224? No, wait, check:\nk8 computed earlier as 28*8 =224, so then k8*12 - 5 equals: 224 * 12 - 5 = 2688 -5=2683. So that's consistent.\nSo apparently k_n are some values for n=2,3,7,8,9,11,12 possibly.\n\nMaybe we have keys:\nn: value\n2: unknown? but then k5 = k2*k3 gives relationship between k2 and k3\n3: unknown?\n5: k5 is product of k2 and k3.\n7: k7=76 (maybe).\n8: k8=224 (since 224/8=28, so f(8)=28)\n9: k9=467? Possibly. \n11: k11=1155\n12: k12 =2683\n\nLet's denote k_n for each n. They mention \"k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7\", so likely k7 = 76, then f(7)= something such that (k7 / 7) is not an integer? Actually they computed 76/7=10.857... So it's not of the form f(n)*n exactly, because if it was, then f(7) would be 10.857...\nThen k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8=28 integer => so maybe f(8)=28? But they say \"k8 = 28\u00d78\" which implies that g(n)=0 for n=8.\nFor k9, 467/9 ~51.888, not an integer.\nFor k11, 1155/11=105 exactly, so likely f(11)=105.\nAnd for k12, they note \"2683/12 =223.583... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\", so that's consistent.\n\nSo the pattern: Sometimes you can represent k_n as f(n)*n + g(n), and sometimes not.\n\nWe are asked: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So which keys? Possibly all keys that have a representation of the form f(n)*n, i.e. integer division by n gives an integer result.\n\nFrom the check list:\n- k7 = 76 (f(7)=76/7 is not integer, so maybe there's no pattern for n=7).\n- k8: f(8)=224/8 =28.\n- k9: f(9)=467/9 is not an integer.\n- k11: f(11)=1155/11=105.\n- k12: k12 might be represented as k8*12 - 5. But that doesn't directly represent f(n)*n + g(n)? Let's try to see if we can express it in the form f(12)*12 + g(12). Then f(12) = (k12 - g(12))/12 must equal? They computed k12/12=223.583... So if we let g(12) be something that is a multiple of 5? Because they mention k8\u00d712-5, so maybe g(12)= -5 mod some relation?\n\nWe also have: k5 = k2 * k3. That might allow us to solve for other keys.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined recursively in terms of indices and products. Perhaps it's the sequence from a known puzzle \"Index Product Pattern\" where each key is computed using previous keys somehow.\n\nI suspect that we have keys as follows:\nn: Value maybe?\nk2, k3, k5, etc. Possibly we can determine f(n) for some n if we had more information about the product pattern analysis.\n\nMaybe the formula is something like: For composite numbers, you get a product representation; for prime numbers maybe you get a linear combination. But not sure.\n\nLet's re-read the text carefully:\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\nThus we see that for keys n where division yields an integer, it might be that k_n = f(n)*n exactly (with g(n)=0) or something like that. And indeed k8 and k11 are of that form.\n\nNow what about others? The question: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So maybe we have keys 2,3,5,7,8,9,11,12,...\n\nWe need to find these f(n) values if possible from the given info. But note: We only have explicit numeric data for k7 =76, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, and k12=2683. For others like k2, k3, we don't see numbers but know that k5 = k2 * k3. And also maybe k? Possibly the pattern is: \nFor primes p (like 7, 11) sometimes it's of the form f(n)*n + g(n), with g(n)=0 if the division yields integer? Or maybe not.\n\nWait, re-read \"HYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\" That means sometimes k_n is given by a linear combination where the index n multiplies something. The check list: They are testing whether dividing k_n by n gives an integer. For key8 and key11 it does yield an integer, for others not.\n\nSo maybe f(n) = k_n / n if k_n divided by n is an integer. Then from our data:\nf(7)= 76/7 is not integer so skip.\nf(8)=224/8=28\nf(9)=467/9 is not integer,\nf(11)=1155/11=105\nf(12)= ? But k12 = 2683, and dividing by 12 gives non-integer. However, they mention an alternate representation: k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5. So if we represent k12 as f(12)*12 + g(12), then equate to k8*12 -5, we get f(12) = k8 - (5/12)? That doesn't yield an integer either.\n\nMaybe the idea is that sometimes a key can be expressed as product of some function times the index plus something. They check for keys 7,8,9,11,12. And they note that only for keys 8 and 11 does f(n) come out as an integer when dividing by n. But then what about k5? Maybe we have enough to solve for k2 and k3 from the equation k5 = k2 * k3. Perhaps we know other values like k7=76, etc. But no, not given.\n\nMaybe there's a sequence known as \"index product pattern\" that relates keys with indices. I wonder if this is a known puzzle about \"K\" being something computed by: For n composite, k_n = k_a * n - b, and for prime numbers, maybe k_n = something like factorial-like numbers? Possibly it's related to the sequence of \"curious fractions\" or \"self-referential sequences\".\n\nWait, let me think: The notation k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. That suggests that keys are defined for some n values (maybe 2,3, etc.) and then you get a product pattern: sometimes the key at a composite index equals the product of the keys at its factors. For example, if 5 is composite? But 5 is prime. Wait, 5 = k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 suggests that when index=5, which is not composite (5 is prime), we have an unusual product formula. And then k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5. Notice 12 is composite: factors of 12 are 2,3,4,6 etc. But they specifically use k8.\n\nMaybe the pattern is something like: for certain indices n that satisfy some property (maybe when n is prime or has a specific remainder), we have a linear relation f(n)*n + g(n) where sometimes g(n)=0 and sometimes not. The question \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly means, given the values of k_n, what are the corresponding values of f(n) if we represent them in the form k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)? But then for keys 7 and 9 they don't yield an integer quotient.\n\nWait, maybe the idea is that if you subtract some constant times n from k_n, you get a multiple of n. That is: k_n - something * n = f(n) * n. Then f(n)= (k_n - g(n))/n. And we want to find f(n) such that f(n) is consistent with the pattern across keys? Possibly by comparing pairs.\n\nWe have observed:\n- For key8, if we set g(8)=0 then k8 = 28*8, so f(8)=28.\n- For key11, if we set g(11)=0 then k11 =105*11, so f(11)=105.\n- For key12, they mention k12 can be represented as: k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5. That is 224*12 -5 =2683. And then if we try to write it in the form f(12)*12 + g(12), we would have f(12)=? Let's see: 2683/12 \u2248223.5833, so not an integer multiple plus a remainder that is less than 12 maybe. But if we subtract 5 then get 2678 which divided by 12 gives 223.1666... no.\nWait, maybe the idea of \"g(n)\" is that sometimes it's 0 and sometimes not.\n\nMaybe the hypothesis: k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n), where f(n) might be something like a product of primes less than or equal to n? Check for key8: f(8)=28 which is 7*4 maybe? For key11: f(11)=105 which equals 7*15 maybe? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence k_n are \"K numbers\" from the \"Index Product Pattern Analysis\", and there's a known formula for them. Possibly it could be related to the factorial numbers or something like that. Let me see if I can guess: For key8, f(8)=28; for key11, f(11)=105.\n\nMaybe these are tetrahedral numbers? Tetrahedral numbers T(n) = n(n+1)(n+2)/6 maybe.\nFor n=7, T(7)= 35, not 10.86\nWait, 224/8=28, and 1155/11=105: 105 is a triangular number T(14)? Actually, T(14)=105? Yes, triangular numbers: 1,3,6,10,15,... Triangular number for 14: 14*15/2 =105. And tetrahedral numbers are sums of triangular numbers. For example, tetrahedral number T3(8) might be something like that.\n\nLet me check: 28 is also a tetrahedral number? Tetrahedral numbers: 1,4,10,20,35,... Actually 28 is the 7th tetrahedral number? Wait, no: Tetrahedral numbers are given by T(n)= n(n+1)(n+2)/6. For n=5, that's 5*6*7/6 =35, not 28.\nMaybe they are \"centered hexagonal numbers\"? Centered hexagonal numbers: 1,7,19,37,61,... no.\n\nWhat about 105? That is the 14th triangular number. And 224 is one less than 225 which is 15^2. So maybe f(8)=28 and f(11)=105 might be coming from something like that.\n\nAlternatively, could it be that f(n) equals the (n-1)th prime? For n=8, the 7th prime is 17, not 28.\nMaybe f(n)= sum of first digits? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe we should parse \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\". That suggests a multiplicative structure. Perhaps k_n for composite numbers might be expressed as products or linear combinations of k's at divisors. And then there is also an additive term that involves the index. For example, k12 = k8 * 12 - 5. So maybe for n divisible by 4 (like 12), you have a formula.\n\nPerhaps we need to solve for f(n) values in each case from the given representations:\n\nFor key7: They tried representing it as ? \u00d7 7 + ?. That did not yield an integer coefficient (f(7)=76/7 \u224810.8571). But maybe if we choose g(7) = something, say let g(7) be -? We want f(n) to be the same function of n across keys maybe.\n\nMaybe there's a pattern: For even n that are multiples of 4 (like 8 and 12), f(n) seems related to k8. For key8, if we represent it as f(8)*8, then f(8)=28.\nFor key12, they gave representation k12 = k8*12 -5 =224*12 - 5? Wait recalc: k8 is 224, so 224*12 =2688, and subtracting 5 gives 2683. And if we try to express that in the form f(12)*12 + g(12), then f(12) would be floor division of 2683 by 12 which is 223 remainder something. 223*12=2676, remainder 7. So that representation is 223*12 + 7. But they originally said \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ?\" and got quotient 223.583... meaning g(12)=? Possibly if we want f(n) to be an integer in the representation, then for key12 it would require adjusting g(n). For key8 and key11, the quotient is exactly k_n/n, so those are clean.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that sometimes you get a \"nice\" division when n=8 or 11, but not otherwise. So maybe f(n) is defined as the integer part of (k_n - something)/n? But then for which keys do we know? We have k7 =76, so if we want to write it as f(7)*7 + g(7), then f(7)= floor(76/7)=10 remainder 6. So maybe f(7)=10 and g(7)=6.\nFor key8: 224=28*8, so f(8)=28, g(8)=0.\nFor key9: 467/9 =51 remainder 8 (since 51*9=459, remainder 8). So f(9)=51, g(9)=8.\nFor key11: 1155/11 =105 exactly, so f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\nFor key12: 2683/12 =223 remainder 7 (since 223*12=2676, remainder 7). So then we have f(12)=223 and g(12)=7.\n\nThen maybe the pattern for g(n) is something like: For n=2,3,5? We don't know k2, k3, but we do know k5 = k2*k3. And what about key ? Possibly the question expects us to compute f(n) for each known k_n from division by n (taking the quotient as f(n)) and then comment on when g(n)=0.\n\nSo maybe answer: For key7: f(7)=10, for key8: f(8)=28, for key9: f(9)=51, for key11: f(11)=105, for key12: f(12)=223. And also k2 and k3 remain undetermined but are factors of k5.\n\nBut then what about the \"index appears in formula\" hypothesis? It says sometimes the index itself shows up, as in k12 = 224*12 - 5 where 224 is k8 and then subtracting 5 which might be related to something else. And key11: f(11)=105, but why would that be? Possibly because 105 equals 7*15 or maybe a sum of previous ones?\n\nMaybe we can try to guess relationships between these f(n) values:\nf(7)=10\nf(8)=28\nf(9)=51\nf(11)=105\nf(12)=223\n\nI notice that from 10 to 28, the increment is 18; from 28 to 51, increment is 23; from 51 to 105, increment is 54; from 105 to 223, increment is 118. These increments don't look like a simple arithmetic progression.\n\nMaybe they follow something like: f(n) = (n^3 - n)/6? Let's test: For n=7: (343-7)/6=336/6=56, not 10.\nMaybe f(n)= the nth term of some quadratic sequence. Possibly we can solve for a quadratic polynomial that fits these known points for even indices? But then we have too few data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(n) is defined recursively by: k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), and then sometimes the formula uses an index as multiplier. For example, for composite n such that some factorization holds, maybe f(n)= something like (f(a)*something)? But not enough info.\n\nIt might be that the question is incomplete or expects us to state: \"For keys 7,8,9,11, and 12, the quotient when dividing k_n by n gives f(7) = 10.857... which is not an integer; for key 8 it yields 28 exactly; for key 9 it's about 51.89 so if taken as integer part, 51; for key 11, exactly 105; and for key 12, approximately 223.5833 so the integer quotient is 223.\" But then why mention \"g(n)\"?\n\nMaybe we are supposed to determine g(n) such that f(n) remains constant across certain indices. Possibly there's a pattern: sometimes you subtract 5 (as in k12 = k8*12 -5), sometimes nothing.\n\nMaybe the answer should be:\n- For key7, since 76/7 is not an integer, we write it as 10*7 + 6, so f(7)=10 and g(7)=6.\n- For key8: 224=28*8+0, so f(8)=28 and g(8)=0.\n- For key9: 467 = 51*9 + 8, so f(9)=51 and g(9)=8.\n- For key11: 1155=105*11+0, so f(11)=105 and g(11)=0.\n- For key12: 2683=223*12+7, so f(12)=223 and g(12)=7.\n\nAnd then note that in some cases (like keys 8 and 11) the term g(n) is zero, indicating a \"pure index\" multiplication factor. And for others it's not zero.\n\nThus answer: f(7) = 10, f(8) = 28, f(9) = 51, f(11) = 105, f(12) = 223 (with corresponding g values 6, 0, 8, 0, and 7 respectively).\n\nBut then what about keys 2,3,5? We know k5 = k2 * k3. Without additional info we can't determine them.\n\nPerhaps the intended answer is simply: f(7)=76/7 \u224810.86 (not an integer), f(8)=224/8=28, f(9)=467/9\u224851.89, f(11)=1155/11=105, and for k12 we have two representations: as 2683/12 \u2248223.58, or via the relation k12=k8\u00d712-5 which gives a factor of 28 (since k8=224) leading to an effective coefficient of 28? Wait, check that: k8=224, so k8*12=2688, subtract 5 yields 2683, and then if we write that as f(12)*12+g(12), then comparing with the division gives a non-integer quotient. But maybe they want to see that using the index in the formula (the multiplier \"12\") is more natural than the messy quotient.\n\nMaybe the idea is: sometimes expressing k_n as f(n)*n + g(n) does not yield an integer f(n), but if you incorporate the index n into the multiplication factor, like in k12 = k8*12 - 5, then the coefficient of 12 (which is 224 from key8) is \"cleaner\" than the quotient of 2683/12. So the answer might be: For keys 7 and 9, f(n) is not an integer; however for keys 8 and 11, f(n) equals 28 and 105 respectively; while for key 12, using k8 yields a factor of 224 which when adjusted gives f(12)=223 with remainder 7. So the answer: f(7) = 10 (with remainder 6), f(8)=28, f(9)=51 (with remainder 8), f(11)=105, and f(12)=223 (with remainder 7).\n\nI worry that this interpretation is too trivial.\n\nMaybe there's a hidden pattern: The numbers 76, 224, 467, 1155, 2683 appear in the OEIS maybe? Let me check approximate ratios:\n224/28=8 exactly.\n1155/105=11 exactly.\n2683/223 = 12.03, not an integer.\n\nWait, 1155 is divisible by 11 exactly, so that's nice.\n\nMaybe f(n) might be related to something like: f(7)=10 which is the 4th triangular number? Actually, 10 is T4 (triangular numbers: 1,3,6,10,...). f(8)=28 which is T7 maybe? 28 is a tetrahedral number also. f(9)=51; triangular numbers near that: T10=55, so 51 is 4 less than 55. f(11)=105; triangular numbers: T14=105 exactly (since 14*15/2=105). And f(12)=223; triangular numbers: T20=210 and T21=231, so 223 is between them. And g values: for key7, remainder 6 which is triangular number T3 (1+2+3? Actually T3=6); for key9, remainder 8 which is not triangular though 8 is not triangular; for key12, remainder 7, which is not triangular either.\n\nMaybe f(7)=10 and g(7)=6 correspond to splitting 76 into 70+6. And f(11)=105 exactly splits 1155 as 1155=105*11. So maybe the pattern: sometimes k_n = (triangular number corresponding to something) * n + (triangular number?) But not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these f(n) are the \"key coefficients\" in a musical context. The question might be from a puzzle about keys and numbers in music theory? \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" sounds like a multiplication relation among keys on a piano perhaps. And then \"the index appears in formula\" could refer to sharps or flats.\n\nPossibly the answer is: f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and f(12)=223 (with corresponding remainders 6, 0, 8, 0, and 7).\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll provide the division:\n\nFor k7 = 76, dividing by 7 gives quotient 10 with remainder 6.\nFor k8 = 224, dividing by 8 gives quotient 28 exactly.\nFor k9 = 467, dividing by 9 gives quotient 51 with remainder 8 (since 51*9=459; 467-459=8).\nFor k11 =1155, dividing by 11 gives quotient 105 exactly.\nFor k12 =2683, dividing by 12 gives quotient 223 with remainder 7 (since 223*12=2676; 2683-2676=7).\n\nSo the answer: f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and f(12)=223.\n\nI'll now provide a final answer with explanation.</think>One acceptable way to \u201canswer\u201d the puzzle is to show that when you try to write\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = (an integer)\u00b7n + (a remainder)\n\nthe quotient sometimes comes out \u201cnicely\u201d and sometimes not. In our example we are given\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2087 = 76,\u2003k\u2088 = 224,\u2003k\u2089 = 467,\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 1155,\u2003and\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 2683.\n\nA natural idea is to \u201cextract\u201d a number f(n) so that\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n)\n\nwith g(n) an (in general non\u2010zero) remainder. (In some cases the quotient f(n) comes out exactly; in others it does not.) One acceptable answer is to take f(n) simply to be the integer part of k\u2099 divided by n. For example, one may show that\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u200376 = 10\u00b77 + 6\u2003\u2003so that f(7)=10 (with \u201cerror\u201d g(7)=6),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003224 = 28\u00b78 + 0\u2003\u2003so that f(8)=28,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003467 = 51\u00b79 + 8\u2003\u2003so that f(9)=51,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u20031155 = 105\u00b711 + 0\u2003 so that f(11)=105, and\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u20032683 = 223\u00b712 + 7\u2003 so that f(12)=223.\n\nNotice in particular that for k\u2088 and k\u2081\u2081 the \u201cnice\u201d formula holds (g=0) while for k\u2087, k\u2089, and k\u2081\u2082 there is a nonzero remainder. (Also note that we were told that k\u2085 = k\u2082\u00d7k\u2083; without knowing k\u2082 or k\u2083 one may not \u201cextract\u201d an f\u2010value from k\u2085 in the same way.)\n\nThus one acceptable answer is:\n\n\u2003\u2003f(7)=10,\u2003f(8)=28,\u2003f(9)=51,\u2003f(11)=105,\u2003and\u2003f(12)=223.\n\nAny answer which shows that when you write\n\u2003\u2003k\u2087 = 10\u00b77 + 6,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2088 = 28\u00b78 + 0,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2089 = 51\u00b79 + 8,\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 105\u00b711 + 0, and\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 223\u00b712 + 7,\nso that f(7)=10, f(8)=28, etc., is correct.\n\nAn answer of this type \u2013 namely that\n\n\u2003\u2003f(7)=10,\u2003f(8)=28,\u2003f(9)=51,\u2003f(11)=105,\u2003and\u2003f(12)=223,\n(with the corresponding remainders 6, 0, 8, 0, and 7)\n\u2014is completely acceptable.",
