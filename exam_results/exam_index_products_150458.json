The question asks: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" They provide numbers:\n\nCheck:\n- k8 = 224. It's given that 224/8=28 exactly. So we get f(8)=28, and then g(8)= ? Actually formula is k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). For n=8: 224 = f(8)*8 + g(8), and it says \"k8 = 28\u00d78\", so it implies that probably g(8) must be zero. But the statement \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" then they computed: 224/8=28 integer, hence presumably f(n)=28 for n=8.\n\n- For k11: k11=1155. Then if we have k_n=f(n)*n+g(n), and apparently it's exactly equal to f(n)*n because 1155/11 =105 is an integer. So then f(11) = 105, g(11)=0 maybe.\n\n- For k12: they computed: \"k12=2683\" but when divided by 12 it gives a non-integer (223.58). But we also have the formula: k8\u00d712 -5. That is given as k12= k8*12 -5 = (28 * 12)-5=336-5=331, but that's not equal to 2683. Wait check: 28*12 = 336; 336-5=331. But they said \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ?\" \u2192 2683/12 =223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683, but wait, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, re-read the text: \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\". Then they said: \"CHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 =10.86 ... \n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8=28 = k8/8 \u2713 \n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9=51.89 ...\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u21921155/11=105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u21922683/12=223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\" There's something off: \"k8\u00d712-5=2683\"? Let's recalc: k8 is given as 224. Then 224*12 = 2688, subtract 5 gives 2683. So indeed they have the formula for k12: k12= (k8)*12 -5.\n\nSo apparently we are trying to see if there is pattern of the form k_n = f(n)\u00d7n + g(n)? Possibly \"f(n)\" might be some function defined in terms of previous keys? Let me re-read text:\n\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 =10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8=28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192467/9=51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u21921155/11=105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u21922683/12=223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n\nIs there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)?\n\nCalculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nI suspect the user is trying to find a function f(n) such that f(2)?, f(3)? Possibly keys are labeled as: k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. And we have given values:\nk7=76,\nk8=224,\nk9=467,\nk11=1155,\nk12=2683.\n\nWait re-read check: \"1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 =10.86 (not clean)\". It appears they tried to divide key by index and got a non-integer, meaning that the additive part is not zero. For k8 they got integer, so maybe f(8)=224/8=28 exactly. And for k11, dividing gives 1155/11 =105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\nFor k12, if we try to divide, it's not an integer (2683/12 is not integer), but they note that using the formula with previous key: \"k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" equals 2683. That might be a hint that maybe for some indices, f(n) times n gives k_n.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that sometimes f(n) = k_n / n if n divides k_n exactly, and otherwise we need to use a different formula? But then they want us \"Calculate f(n)\" for each key. So likely answer: f(7)= ? maybe 10? Wait, let's try: For keys where division is exact:\nk8: f(8)=224/8=28.\nk11: f(11)=1155/11=105.\n\nFor others, if not integer then we have an \"offset\" g(n) that makes up the difference. But user says: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly they want us to find \"f(7), f(8), f(9), f(11), f(12)\" from given keys? And maybe also f(2) and f(3) because of the earlier note that k5= k2*k3.\n\nWe have: \nk2: unknown?\nk3: unknown?\n\nWait, text \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" suggests relation. Possibly keys are defined recursively? Maybe we have a sequence of keys: k1, k2, k3,... maybe defined by some recurrence relation based on indices and products.\n\nI need to re-read the problem carefully:\n\nWe see:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no) - that line is ambiguous. It might be saying: \"k5 equals k2 times k3\", but then \"indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no\" could mean the multiplication of indices gives a number that is not equal to something.\n\n- Then: k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!). So apparently k12 has a pattern involving index 12 and previous key k8. And then they check several keys:\nFor n=7, if we assume formula \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\", for k7 we get 76, which divided by 7 is not an integer (10.857...). For k8, it's exactly divisible giving 28; for k9, division yields non-integer; for k11, division gives 105; for k12, division yields non-integer but if you compute using previous key: k8 * 12 - 5 = 224*12 - 5 = 2683. So apparently the pattern might be that sometimes f(n) is exactly equal to k_n/n and sometimes it's not.\n\nMaybe we want to determine \"f(n)\" for each given index such that:\nk_n = f(n)*n + g(n), where g(n)=? and maybe find a pattern for f(n). Possibly f(n) is defined as the largest integer d such that n divides k_n, or something like that. Let's try to see: For n=7, if we want f(7) to be an integer then it should satisfy 7*f(7) <=76 <7*(f(7)+1). That means f(7)=10 because 10*7=70 and remainder is 6; but then g(7)=6. For n=9, k9 =467, dividing by 9 gives 51 with remainder 8 (because 9*51=459, remainder 8), so maybe f(9)=51.\nFor n=12, if we assume the form k12 = f(12)*12 + g(12), then 2683 divided by 12 gives quotient 223 remainder 7 because 12*223=2676 and remainder is 7; but note that they also have formula: k8 * 12 -5. And we already know k8=224, so k12 = 224*12 -5=2688-5=2683, which indeed gives quotient=223 and remainder 7.\n\nSo possible answers:\nFor n=7: f(7)=10, g(7)=76 - 70=6.\nn=8: f(8)=28, g(8)=224 - (28*8)=0.\nn=9: f(9)=51, g(9)=467 - (51*9)=467 -459=8.\nn=11: f(11)=105, g(11)=1155-105*11 =1155-1155=0.\nn=12: f(12)=223, g(12)=2683 - 223*12 =2683 -2676=7.\n\nBut the question explicitly asks \"Calculate f(n) for each key\". So likely answer: \nFor k7: f(7)=10\nk8: f(8)=28\nk9: f(9)=51\nk11: f(11)=105\nk12: f(12)=223.\n\nBut wait, the original message \"OBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" might also be used. They mention indices 2 and 3 maybe implying that for n=2 and n=3, something holds? Perhaps we want to calculate f(2) and f(3)? But not sure.\n\nWe can consider: \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\". And then \"Calculate f(n)\" means simply divide k_n by n (floor division or integer part if divisible). For keys:\nFor key 7: 76 / 7 = 10 remainder 6, so f(7)=10.\nFor key 8: 224 / 8 = 28 exactly, so f(8)=28.\nFor key 9: 467/9 gives quotient 51 with remainder (467 - 459=8), so f(9)=51.\nFor key 11: 1155 / 11=105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\nFor key 12: If we try integer division then 2683/12 is not an integer but if we use floor division it's 223 remainder 7 (because 12*223=2676 and remainder is 7), so f(12)=223.\n\nBut note the text \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" then they computed \"224/8=28\", which implies that in k8, g(n)=0. For k11, same thing. So answer: f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, f(12)=223.\n\nBut wait, the text said \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u21922683/12=223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". That suggests that if we follow pattern \"f(n) * n\" then for n=12 it would be non integer quotient unless adjusted by subtracting something? But they already did: f(12)= 223 because k12 = 223*12 +7.\n\nSo answer: f(n) is given by the integer division of k_n by n. So:\nf(7)=floor(76/7)=10,\nf(8)=224/8=28,\nf(9)=467//9=51,\nf(11)=1155/11=105,\nf(12)=223 (since 2683 = 223*12+7).\n\nBut wait, is that pattern? The user says \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly we want to calculate the factor f(n) as well. So answer:\nFor k2, maybe not computed? Or perhaps keys are: n=2,3,5,7,8,9,11,12. But only some have been given values.\n\nWe see that the pattern \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\" with f(n) being an integer that may be derived as quotient of k_n divided by n (when possible) and then remainder is g(n). So answer: f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, f(12)=223.\n\nBut the user says \"Calculate f(n)\" maybe also for k2, k3? Because they mentioned \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\". That means if we know k2 and k3 then f(5) would be computed from that? But we don't have values for k2, k3. Alternatively, we might guess f(2)=?, f(3)=?. Let's consider possibility: perhaps the pattern is defined recursively by \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\" where f(n) = (some function of n and previous keys) maybe using differences or products?\n\nMaybe the idea: Sometimes the index appears in formula when it divides k_n exactly. For example, for k8 we get 28 which might equal f(2)+? but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider if there is a known sequence: k5 = k2 * k3 implies maybe k2 and k3 are primes or something like that. But the text \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" suggests a pattern where one key equals another multiplied by the index (or some factor) plus/minus a constant.\n\nMaybe this is part of a puzzle from Project Euler or similar puzzles about keys? Possibly it's a cryptogram or something like that. The question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" implies we want to find f(2), f(3), f(4), etc. But the given checks are only for n=7,8,9,11,12.\n\nLet me re-read: \"OBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 =10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 =28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192467/9 =51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u21921155/11 =105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u21922683/12 =223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 and k11 are exactly divisible, whereas k7, k9, and k12 have remainders.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that when index n is prime (or composite) then sometimes f(n)=? \nn=2: unknown?\nn=3: unknown?\nn=4: unknown?\nn=5: product of previous keys\nn=6: unknown?\nn=7: not divisible by 7 exactly, quotient 10 remainder 6.\nn=8: exactly divisible (f(8)=28)\nn=9: exactly? Actually, k9 gave 51.857? Wait recalc 467/9 = 51 with remainder 8 because 9*51=459 and remainder is 8.\nn=10: unknown?\nn=11: exactly divisible (f(11)=105)\nn=12: f(12)=223 remainder 7.\n\nMaybe the function f(n) might be computed as the nearest integer to k_n/n. For n=7, 76/7=10.857... so rounding down gives 10; for n=9, 467/9=51.888..., so floor is 51; for n=12, floor is 223.\n\nSo answer:\nf(2) and f(3) we don't know from given data.\nWe have: f(5)=? Possibly from k5 = k2*k3, if we assume some pattern then maybe f(5)=? But not enough info.\n\nI can only compute for the keys provided. The checks are on keys 7,8,9,11,12. So answer:\nFor n=7: f(7) = floor(76/7) = 10.\nFor n=8: f(8)=224/8 =28.\nFor n=9: f(9)=467//9 =51.\nFor n=11: f(11)=1155/11 =105.\nFor n=12: f(12)=2683//12 =223 (with remainder 7).\n\nI'll answer that.\n\nMaybe I should include a disclaimer at beginning and end if it's a sensitive topic like medical, legal. But this is not one of those topics. However, instructions say: \"you must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and at the end when replying topics above\" for topics like medical, legal, financial matters. But here it's math puzzle. The instructions 4 says \"Handling Complex Topics - Provide general guidance on sensitive topics like medical...\". But this is not that. So no disclaimer required because it's a mathematical puzzle.\n\nWait, instruction #2: \"Security and Ethical Guidelines\" but not required disclaimers for every message unless it's sensitive. Actually the guidelines say: \"Provide general guidance on sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial matters or political matters, while clarifying that users should seek certified professionals...\". This is math so no disclaimer needed.\n\nHowever, instructions #4 mention \"you must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and at the end when replying topics above.\" But this only applies to sensitive topics? Actually it says: \"when replying topics above\" i.e. medical, legal, financial matters or political matters. This is not one of those. So no disclaimers required.\n\nBut instructions #4 say: \"you must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and at the end when replying topics above.\" The phrase \"topics above\" might refer to sensitive topics? But math isn't sensitive so I'll not include disclaimers.\n\nI should follow instruction 1-6. However, the system message instructs me to be aligned with instructions. So I will provide a clear answer using markdown formatting if appropriate.\n\nThus final answer:\n\nWe have keys: \nk7 = 76,\nk8 = 224,\nk9 = 467,\nk11 = 1155,\nk12 = 2683.\nAssuming k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) with f(n) integer, then:\nFor n=7: f(7)= floor(76/7)=10 (with remainder 6).\nFor n=8: f(8)= 224/8 =28 exactly (remainder 0).\nFor n=9: f(9)=467//9=51 (remainder 8).\nFor n=11: f(11)=1155/11=105 exactly.\nFor n=12: f(12)=2683//12=223 (remainder 7).\n\nI can also note that the pattern seems to be that sometimes k_n is exactly divisible by n, and sometimes not. The computed values of f(n) are as above.\n\nThus final answer. Use markdown formatting with bullet points etc.\n\nI'll now produce the final answer message accordingly.</think>Below is one way to interpret the pattern and compute f(n):\n\nSuppose we assume that for each key k\u2099 there exists an integer multiplier f(n) (and a remainder g(n)) so that\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n) \u00b7 n + g(n).\n\nLooking at the examples given:\n\n1. For n = 7, we have k\u2087 = 76. Dividing:\n\u2003\u200376 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.857\u2026 \nThis means if we take f(7) = 10 then\n\u2003\u2003g(7) = 76 \u2013 (10 \u00b7 7) = 6.\n\n2. For n = 8, k\u2088 = 224 is given and it divides evenly:\n\u2003\u2003224 \u00f7 8 = 28 exactly.\nThus, f(8) = 28 with g(8) = 0.\n\n3. For n = 9, we have k\u2089 = 467. Dividing:\n\u2003\u2003467 \u00f7 9 \u2248 51.888\u2026 \nTaking the integer part gives\n\u2003\u2003f(9) = 51 and then\n\u2003\u2003g(9) = 467 \u2013 (51 \u00b7 9) = 467 \u2013 459 = 8.\n\n4. For n = 11, k\u2081\u2081 = 1155 divides exactly:\n\u2003\u20031155 \u00f7 11 = 105.\nSo, f(11) = 105 and g(11) = 0.\n\n5. Finally, for n = 12, we are told that although\n\u2003\u20032683 \u00f7 12 \u2248 223.583\u2026 \nif we write it in the form k\u2081\u2082 = f(12) \u00b7 12 + g(12), then taking the integer quotient gives:\n\u2003\u2003f(12) = 223 with remainder\n\u2003\u2003g(12) = 2683 \u2013 (223 \u00b7 12) = 2683 \u2013 2676 = 7.\n\nIt is also noted in the observations that for some keys the index n appears \u201cnaturally\u201d in the formula. For example, k\u2081\u2082 was also given by k\u2088 \u00d7 12 \u2013 5. In our interpretation here we only extract f(n) from the division of k\u2099 by n (with any remainder captured by g(n)).\n\nThus, the computed values are:\n\n\u2022\u2003f(7) = 10  \n\u2022\u2003f(8) = 28  \n\u2022\u2003f(9) = 51  \n\u2022\u2003f(11) = 105  \n\u2022\u2003f(12) = 223\n\nThis is one consistent way to \u201cextract\u201d f(n) from the keys given. (Note that if additional context were available for other indices, similar reasoning could be applied.)",
