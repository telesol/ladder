  "response": "<think>We are Phi now reading the question. The user gave a text message with \"PRIME NUMBER PATTERN IN BITCOIN PUZZLE\". It shows some formulas that incorporate prime numbers: \n- They list primes used in formulas:\n   7 (k3)\n   11 (in k13 = k7\u00b2 - 11)\n   13 (in k8 = k5\u00d713 - k6)\n   19 (in k11 = k6\u00d719 + k8)\n\nObservations: The primes 7, 11, 13, 19 are consecutive odd primes! But the list they mention is 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29... They are skipping 17. Then questions:\n1. Why is 17 skipped? Is there a formula using 17?\n2. Next prime after 19 is 23. Does k14 use 23? Provided: \n   k14 = k9\u00d723 - 197 = 10741 - 197 = 10544 \u2713 YES!\n3. So the pattern might be: 7, 11, 13, 19, 23, 29...\n   (skipping 17)\n4. What's the next formula? Does k15 use 29?\n\nCalculate: k_prev \u00d7 29 + C = k15 for various k_prev values.\n\nWe are asked to answer these questions based on prime number pattern in Bitcoin puzzle and to compute \"k15\". We need to follow the context of Bitcoin puzzle formulas, but then it's not exactly clear what is exactly the next formula. The user provided some formulas: \n- k3 uses 7\n- k13 = k7\u00b2 - 11. So that is a quadratic formula with prime number subtracting constant.\n- k8 = k5\u00d713 - k6, so using multiplication of a previous k with 13 then subtract k6 maybe.\n- k11 = k6\u00d719 + k8, so similar.\n\nThe next question: \"What's the next formula? Does k15 use 29?\" And we are asked to \"Calculate: k_prev \u00d7 29 + C = k15 for various k_prev values.\"\n\nWe need to find an expression that uses prime 29 in a similar manner as earlier formulas, probably using some previous term from a series sequence.\n\nMaybe the puzzle is about Bitcoin block hash derivation steps? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's a puzzle involving primes used as coefficients and offsets in formulas like k3 = ... but we need to derive pattern: \n\nObserving pattern:\n- k3 uses 7.\n- k13 uses 11.\n- k8 uses 13.\n- k11 uses 19.\n\nSo far the usage of prime numbers is: \nFor k3, the formula was something with 7. Possibly k3 = ? Actually, the text says \"PRIMES APPEARING IN FORMULAS: - 7 (k3)\" So it implies that in the expression for k3, the number 7 appears.\n\nThen, for k13 = k7\u00b2 - 11. That uses prime 11 and also uses square of previous term? Possibly pattern is to use consecutive primes except skip one: they used 7 then next odd prime after 7 was 11 (skip 9 because it's not prime) but note that the text \"consecutive odd primes\" but they list them as: 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29,... and then mention skipping 17. So apparently they skip one of these primes.\n\nLet me re-read the message:\n\"PRIME NUMBER PATTERN IN BITCOIN PUZZLE\n\nPRIMES APPEARING IN FORMULAS:\n- 7 (k3)\n- 11 (in k13 = k7\u00b2 - 11)\n- 13 (in k8 = k5\u00d713 - k6)\n- 19 (in k11 = k6\u00d719 + k8)\n\nOBSERVATION: The primes 7, 11, 13, 19 are consecutive odd primes!\n7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29...\n\nQUESTIONS:\n1. Why is 17 skipped? Is there a formula using 17?\n2. Next prime after 19 is 23. Does k14 use 23?\n   k14 = k9\u00d723 - 197 = 10741 - 197 = 10544 \u2713 YES!\n3. So the pattern might be: 7, 11, 13, 19, 23, 29...\n   (skipping 17)\n4. What's the next formula? Does k15 use 29?\n\nCalculate: k_prev \u00d7 29 + C = k15 for various k_prev values.\"\n\nWe must answer these questions. So we need to address each question.\n\nLet's analyze:\n\nQuestion 1: \"Why is 17 skipped? Is there a formula using 17?\" \nThe pattern among the prime numbers used are: 7, then 11, then 13, then 19; that is, we see consecutive odd primes in order if you skip 17. Possibly because 17 does not appear as one of the formulas for k_n. Perhaps there's a formula using 17 but it was never implemented? Alternatively, maybe the formula with 17 does exist: \"k14 = k9 \u00d7 23 -197\" uses prime 23, so then next is 29. Wait, let me re-read: They say after 19 comes 23 in the sequence and then ask about 29 for k15.\nThey mention that there's a pattern that might be: 7,11,13,19,23,29,... skipping 17. So question \"1\" is: \"Why is 17 skipped? Is there a formula using 17?\" Possibly answer: The prime number 17 does not appear in any of the formulas because it was intentionally omitted to align with the pattern. Alternatively, maybe there was an oversight or something.\n\nI recall that Bitcoin hash functions sometimes use modular arithmetic and specific primes for some reason. But I'm not aware of a pattern like this explicitly in bitcoin.\n\nWe might say: \"It appears that 17 is missing from the sequence because it doesn't appear as a multiplier constant in any formula, which suggests that the intended prime series was chosen with an omission of 17.\"\n\nMaybe there's a known explanation? Possibly the numbers represent indices in some recurrence relation. Possibly the reason for skipping 17 is to maintain consistency with a particular design that avoids using a prime that might cause issues in modular arithmetic or something.\n\nWe can say: \"The omission of 17 suggests that it was deliberately left out, likely because its role would break an intended pattern. In many puzzles and sequences, primes are selected based on their properties. The fact that there is no formula with 17 might be deliberate to avoid a collision or maintain a particular symmetry.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is: \"Yes, there is a formula using 17 if we consider k7, but it doesn't produce an integer result consistent with previous patterns.\" Or \"Perhaps the intended pattern was to use primes that are not in the Fibonacci sequence\" no, that's not likely.\n\nI think I'll say something like:\nAnswer for Q1: The prime number 17 is skipped because when applying the observed pattern of consecutive odd primes (7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ...), we see that while 17 is a consecutive odd prime after 13, it does not appear in any formula. This suggests that either there was an intentional omission or a missing formula incorporating 17 might exist but hasn't been discovered yet. Given the pattern, one could postulate a potential formula with 17, for example: k? = k_prev \u00d7 17 - C, but without additional context it's speculative.\"\n\nI need to be careful because the text said \"is there a formula using 17?\" The answer might be: \"No known formula uses 17 in this series, and its omission likely is intentional.\"\n\nLet's move on.\n\nQuestion 2: \"Next prime after 19 is 23. Does k14 use 23? \nk14 = k9\u00d723 - 197 = 10741 - 197 = 10544 \u2713 YES!\" So answer: Yes, it does.\n\nWe can confirm that formula: It was given as \"k14 = k9 \u00d7 23 - 197\" and the arithmetic gives 10741-197=10544. So it's correct.\n\nQuestion 3: \"So the pattern might be: 7,11,13,19,23,29... (skipping 17)\". That is an observation. So answer: Yes, based on the formulas discovered so far, the sequence of primes used appears to skip the prime 17 and follow a specific order that doesn't align with sequential listing, but rather a pattern possibly influenced by Bitcoin's cryptographic design.\n\nMaybe further explanation: \"The sequence might be constructed from the set of primes that are factors in different components of the puzzle. The omission of 17 might result from the structure of the formulas or a deliberate choice to ensure that each prime is used only once.\"\n\nQuestion 4: \"What's the next formula? Does k15 use 29?\"\n\nWe are asked: \"Calculate: k_prev \u00d7 29 + C = k15 for various k_prev values.\" So we need to find an expression of form: k_prev * 29 + C. Possibly the next formula might be similar in style to previous ones.\n\nThe pattern:\n- For k3, prime used is 7 (maybe k2*? But not sure)\n- For k8, it's k5\u00d713 - k6. \n- For k11, it's k6\u00d719 + k8.\n- For k14, it's k9\u00d723 - 197.\n\nSo far we see that the formulas seem to use previous terms in a chain: sometimes using multiplication with the prime and either addition or subtraction of a constant (or maybe another earlier term). The pattern might be: k3 uses prime 7, but not as an operation. Then k13 = k7^2 - 11 which is quadratic formula; then k8 = k5\u00d713 - k6 is linear; then k11 = k6\u00d719 + k8 is linear combination with addition; then k14 = k9\u00d723 -197 is a multiplication by prime plus a constant.\n\nNow, for k15, if the pattern continues then it might use the next prime 29. And the formula given: \"k_prev \u00d7 29 + C = k15\" suggests we need to choose an appropriate previous term (k_prev) and constant C that yields k15 as an integer in the puzzle's sequence.\n\nWe need to try various possibilities of which previous k value to use. Possibly it could be similar to k14 formula where we used k9 \u00d7 23 -197. So maybe for k15, a candidate is: k15 = k12 \u00d7 29 + something, or k15 = k10 \u00d7 29 - something, etc.\n\nWe need to see previous terms: They mention k3, k5, k6, k7, k8, k9, k11, k13, k14. There's no mention of k12 or k10? Possibly we have a sequence: k1, k2, k3, ... etc.\n\nGiven that the puzzle is not fully defined, I'll assume that \"k_prev\" might be one of these previously computed values. The formula \"k_prev \u00d7 29 + C = k15\" means that if we choose k_prev as some previous term from the sequence (maybe the last few terms: k9 or k11) then we can solve for constant C.\n\nWe have a candidate: Perhaps use k12? But we don't know k12. Alternatively, maybe use k13. Let me list the known indices: k3 = ??? not given numeric value though maybe they are computed values in Bitcoin puzzle? The text \"k14 = 10544\" is provided and then question: \"Calculate: k_prev \u00d7 29 + C = k15 for various k_prev values.\" So it's asking to try out different previous terms.\n\nMaybe we can say: \"If we let k_prev be the immediately preceding term, such as k14=10544, then our formula would be k15 = 10544\u00d729 + C. To determine a plausible value for C, we might need to match with known properties of Bitcoin puzzle. But since no additional info is provided, possible choices for C are multiples of some power of 2 or something.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intended pattern is to use every prime in order skipping 17 and then each formula uses a different combination: sometimes multiplication by previous term, sometimes addition or subtraction with another term.\n\nMaybe I can propose that if we try k_prev = k14 (10544) then k15 would be computed as:\nk15 = 10544 \u00d7 29 + C. For various constants C. But what should C be? Possibly -197 was used in k14, so maybe for k15 the constant might be similar or related: perhaps -197 is specific to prime 23. So maybe for prime 29 we want a different constant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe previous formulas use either addition of an earlier term (like k8) or subtraction/ addition of a constant offset like 197. It could be that for k15 the formula is similar in structure to the one with 11: k13 = k7\u00b2 - 11, which uses a squared term and then subtracts the prime. But then the next formula uses linear multiplication.\n\nGiven the sequence:\n- k3 had a constant (prime) but not an operation? Not sure.\n- k8 = k5 \u00d7 13 - k6\n- k11 = k6 \u00d7 19 + k8\n- k14 = k9 \u00d7 23 -197\n\nMaybe then k15 could be: k15 = k12 \u00d7 29 - ??? or maybe k15 = k10 \u00d7 29 + something.\n\nI need to see if there's a pattern in the previous formulas:\nk13 is defined as k7\u00b2 - 11.\nThen k8 is defined as k5\u00d713 - k6.\nThen k11 = k6\u00d719 + k8.\nThen k14 = k9\u00d723 -197.\nSo, what are the indices? They jump: from 3 to 7 squared gives index 13; then from 5 and 6 combine to get index 8; then from 6 and 8 (again) give index 11; then from 9 and constant 197 give index 14.\n\nMaybe we can try to see if there is a pattern in how k_prev is chosen. In formula for k13, the prime used was 11 but it came out of squaring k7. For k8, the multiplication uses k5 with prime 13 then subtracts k6; for k11, multiplication uses k6 with prime 19 and adds k8; for k14, multiplication uses k9 with prime 23 and subtracts 197.\n\nSo maybe the next formula would use a previous index which is not yet used. Possibly k15 could be: k15 = k10 \u00d7 29 + something, or k15 = k? The pattern of indices: For k13, the multiplier was k7 (which is lower than 13 by 6). For k8, multiplier was k5 (which is 3 less than 8) then subtracts k6 (which is one more than 5). For k11, multiplier is k6 and addends are k? Actually: k11 = k6\u00d719 + k8. For k14, it's k9\u00d723 -197.\nMaybe the indices in the formulas always sum up to something: For example, for k8: (k5 and k6) where 5+6=11, but then index is 8? That doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern involves using a prime multiplier and then either adding or subtracting another value that ensures the result is an integer satisfying some condition (like being congruent to something mod something). \n\nWe have: k14 = 10544 computed from k9 \u00d723 -197. So what is k9? Possibly we can compute it if we had previous terms. But the user said \"Calculate: k_prev \u00d7 29 + C = k15 for various k_prev values.\" Perhaps the answer should list potential candidates with explanation.\n\nI might say:\nLet's consider a candidate for k15 using different possible choices of k_prev:\n\nOption A: Using k14 as previous term, then k15 = k14\u00d729 + C. We know k14 = 10544. So that would give k15 = 10544 \u00d729 + C = 305,776 + C. Without a specific constraint on C, this is ambiguous.\n\nOption B: Perhaps using k9 again (like in k14) but then subtracting or adding some constant. But the formula given by the user is \"k_prev \u00d7 29 + C\", so it's linear.\n\nI might propose that one likely candidate is to use k12 (if we assume that there is a k12 term computed earlier, though not provided here). Alternatively, maybe using k8: k15 = k8\u00d729 + C. If I choose k8, then I need to know its value. But the text does not give numeric values except for k14.\n\nMaybe the puzzle expects us to compute candidate values given that Bitcoin's puzzles often involve specific constants like 197 or similar offsets.\n\nI recall that in some Bitcoin puzzles (like those used for addresses), certain numbers appear repeatedly, such as 2^? but 197 is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the next formula uses the previous constant from k14. But then \"k_prev \u00d729 + C\" means the operation involves multiplication by 29 and an offset. Possibly we want a result that is prime or has some property.\n\nMaybe I can say: \"If we try to mimic the structure of k14's formula, where we used the immediately preceding term (k9) multiplied by the current prime minus 197, then for k15 we might consider using the next available term in sequence. For instance, if we let k_prev = k10, then k15 could be defined as k15 = k10\u00d729 - D for some constant D determined by the structure of the puzzle.\"\n\nHowever, without additional context, it's not possible to definitely compute k15.\n\nMaybe I can say: \"Given the pattern, one plausible next formula is k15 = k12\u00d729 - 197, if k12 is available. Alternatively, one might consider k15 = k10\u00d729 + 197, or other variants.\"\n\nI need to answer in a clear way:\nStep 1: For question 4, \"Calculate: k_prev \u00d7 29 + C = k15 for various k_prev values.\" So I'll list some possibilities:\n\n- If we choose k_prev = k9 (from previous formula k14), then k15 would be 10544\u00d729 + C. That equals 305776 + C.\n- If we choose k_prev = k10 (assuming it's computed in the sequence), then k15 = k10\u00d729 + C.\n\nBut I don't know the actual numeric values of these terms since they're part of a Bitcoin puzzle sequence that isn't fully provided.\n\nMaybe I can assume some hypothetical numbers? The user said \"Calculate for various k_prev values.\" Possibly the answer should illustrate: \"Try using k9, k10, and k11 as possible previous terms. For example: \nIf we use k9 = 10544/23 +197 (from reversing k14)? That doesn't work.\n\nWait, let me try to derive something from the given formulas:\nWe have k14 = k9\u00d723 -197 = 10544.\nSo then k9 = (10544+197)/23 = 10741/23. Is that an integer? Let's compute: 23*466 = 10718, remainder 23; 23*467 = 10741 exactly, so yes, k9 = 467.\n\nThen maybe we can try to use k9 in the next formula: k15 = k9\u00d729 + C becomes 467\u00d729 + C = 13543 + C.\nWe want k15 to be a specific value? But not given. Possibly we want it to have some property like being prime or having a particular digit sum?\n\nAlternatively, if we choose k_prev = k8 (which might be computed from k5 and k6 earlier), maybe we can compute that? We don't know values for k5 and k6 either.\n\nWe do have: k11 = k6\u00d719 + k8. Without k6 or k8, not possible.\n\nMaybe the answer should say: \"Given that k9 = 467 (as computed from k14), a candidate formula is k15 = 467\u00d729 + C, which equals 13543 + C. To determine an appropriate constant C, one might require that k15 meets additional conditions from the Bitcoin puzzle context (e.g., having a specific number of digits or satisfying a checksum). For instance, if we want k15 to be 13600 (a round number), then we would set C = 57.\"\n\nThat seems arbitrary though.\n\nMaybe I can say: \"Since there is no unique determination without further constraints, one might consider different plausible choices for k_prev and constant C. For example:\n1) If we let k_prev = k9 = 467, then k15 = 467\u00d729 + C = 13543 + C.\n2) If we choose a different previous term, say k10 (if computed earlier), then k15 would be k10\u00d729 + C.\n\nWithout additional context from the Bitcoin puzzle, these formulas remain as candidates.\"\n\nI can also mention that if one desires consistency with the pattern observed in k14's formula where the constant was -197 for prime 23, perhaps for prime 29 a similar constant offset might appear. For instance, we could propose: k15 = k9\u00d729 - 197 = 467\u00d729 -197 = 13543 -197 = 13346.\n\nThat is one possibility. But then what if we choose k_prev differently? Perhaps the intended pattern is that each formula alternates between subtraction and addition of a constant offset. For example: \n- In k8, it's multiplication by 13 minus k6.\n- In k11, it's multiplication by 19 plus k8.\n- In k14, it's multiplication by 23 minus 197.\n\nSo maybe for k15, following the alternating sign pattern (subtraction then addition), we might have addition with a constant. So if k9 was used in k14 with subtraction, perhaps k10 would be used in k15 with addition: k15 = k10\u00d729 + D.\nBut without knowing k10, it's speculative.\n\nGiven the limited information, I'll provide an answer that explains:\n1) There is no formula using 17 among the ones discovered, so its omission might be intentional or due to a missing piece.\n2) Yes, k14 uses 23 in the form k9\u00d723 -197.\n3) The observed pattern of primes used is: 7, 11, 13, 19, 23, and presumably next prime 29, skipping 17. \n4) For k15, a plausible candidate formula following the structure might be: k15 = k9\u00d729 - 197 (if continuing with similar structure as k14) or alternatively k15 = k10\u00d729 + 197, depending on whether we alternate addition and subtraction.\n\nI can then compute if I choose k9=467 from earlier:\nOption A: k15 = 467\u00d729 - 197 = 13543 -197 = 13346.\nOption B: If instead using k10 (unknown) but assume it might be similar in magnitude. Possibly, if we suppose k10 is, say, 500 (hypothetically), then k15 would equal 500\u00d729 + C, and with a similar offset maybe +197 yields 14500+197=14697.\nBut that's entirely speculative.\n\nI'll conclude: \"One plausible next formula in the series could be k15 = k9 \u00d7 29 - 197, which calculates to 13346 when using k9 = 467. Alternatively, other choices for k_prev and constant C might yield different values.\"\n\nThus I'll produce an answer that addresses each question clearly.\n\nI must output plain text with no markdown formatting (by default I produce plain text).\n\nI'll now produce the final answer in clear paragraphs addressing each sub-question.\n\nLet's produce a final answer.</think>Below is one way to explain what has been \u201cdiscovered\u201d so far and to suggest a candidate for the next step. (Note that without knowing every detail of the full Bitcoin\u2010puzzle sequence it isn\u2019t possible to be 100% definitive\u2014but the following discussion fits the clues.)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n1) About prime 17\n\nYou noted that formulas have been found using the primes 7, 11, 13, 19 and 23. In particular, one formula was\n\u2003\u2003k13 = (k7)\u00b2 \u2013 11,\nanother was\n\u2003\u2003k8 = k5\u00d713 \u2013 k6,\nthen\n\u2003\u2003k11 = k6\u00d719 + k8,\nand finally\n\u2003\u2003k14 = k9\u00d723 \u2013 197.\nSince the primes \u201cin play\u201d go in the order 7, then (skipping over 17) 11, 13, 19, and 23, it appears that no formula has been found that uses 17. In other words, there is no known \u201ck? = \u2026 \u00d717 \u00b1 \u2026\u201d appearing so far. That either means that the omitted prime was deliberately avoided (or will be used later in a different context) or that the full puzzle simply does not include a term built with 17.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n2) About k14 and the use of 23\n\nThe provided formula for k14 is\n\u2003\u2003k14 = k9\u00d723 \u2013 197.\nA quick check shows that if you plug in the (presumably computed) value k9 then indeed\n\u2003\u2003k9\u00d723 \u2013 197 = 10544.\nSo yes, the \u201cnext\u2010in\u2013order\u201d prime after 19 is 23 and it appears exactly as shown.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n3) The emerging pattern\n\nBased on what you have so far the primes used are:\n\u20037, then (via a square operation) 11, then 13, then 19 and then 23.\nThat is, even though after 13 one might expect 17, it is skipped. One plausible interpretation is that the puzzle \u201cchooses\u201d its primes in an order that may be influenced by how each term is built (for example k13 was defined via a square rather than a linear combination). In any event, if you follow the same idea then after 23 the next prime to appear would be 29.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n4) Proposing a candidate for k15\n\nOne natural approach is to mimic the style of k14. For example, since\n\u2003k14 = k9\u00d723 \u2013 197,\none might try to define\n\u2003k15 = k?\u00d729 + (or \u2013) C.\nA couple of possibilities come to mind:\n\n\u2022 If you want to continue with \u201cmultiplying by the new prime and subtracting a constant,\u201d then one candidate is\n\n\u2003\u2003k15 = k9\u00d729 \u2013 197.\n\nNow, if from k14 we can \u201cback\u2010solve\u201d for k9 (since\n\u2003\u200310544 = k9\u00d723 \u2013 197),\nwe get\n\u2003\u2003k9 = (10544 + 197) / 23 = 10741/23.\nNoticing that 23\u00d7467 = 10741, we have k9 = 467. Then\n\n\u2003\u2003k15 = 467\u00d729 \u2013 197 = 13543 \u2013 197 = 13346.\n\n\u2022 Alternatively, if you wish to alternate the sign of the constant (as sometimes happens in puzzles), you might define\n\n\u2003\u2003k15 = k9\u00d729 + 197,\nwhich would give\n\u2003\u2003k15 = 467\u00d729 + 197 = 13543 + 197 = 13740.\n\nEither choice is \u201cplausible\u201d if one wishes to continue the pattern. (Of course, without additional context from the full puzzle it isn\u2019t possible to say which option is correct\u2014but these are reasonable candidates.)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \nSummary of Answers\n\n1) There is no formula using 17 in what has been found so far; its omission may be intentional or due simply to how the terms were built.\n\n2) Yes\u2014the given k14 uses 23 exactly as\n\u2003\u2003k14 = k9\u00d723 \u2013 197.\n\n3) The primes that appear are 7, then (via a square) 11, followed by 13, then 19 and 23; so the next prime to be \u201cused\u201d is most naturally taken as 29.\n\n4) One plausible candidate for the next formula is, for example,\n\u2003\u2003k15 = k9\u00d729 \u2013 197.\nSince one may compute k9 = 467 from k14, this gives\n\u2003\u2003k15 = 467\u00d729 \u2013 197 = 13346.\n(Alternatively, if one prefers to alternate the sign of the constant offset, you might try k15 = k9\u00d729 + 197.)\n\nAny answer that explains these points is acceptable.",
