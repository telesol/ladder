  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence, which would mean each term is a linear combination of the two previous terms, like k\u2099 = a\u00d7k\u2099\u208b\u2081 + b\u00d7k\u2099\u208b\u2082. The problem gives me the values for k\u2087 = 76 and k\u2088 = 224, and asks if there are integers a and b that satisfy these equations. \n\nFirst, I'll write down the equations based on the given terms. \n\nFrom k\u2087 = 76, we have:\n76 = a\u00d7k\u2086 + b\u00d7k\u2085. Wait, actually, hold on, the user mentioned k\u2087 = 76 = a\u00d7k\u2086 + b\u00d7k\u2085? But in their problem statement, they wrote:\n\n\"For k\u2087 = 76:\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n76 = 49a + 21b\"\n\nWait, maybe they are assuming that k\u2086 is 49 and k\u2085 is 21? Hmm, that might be part of the given sequence. But the user hasn't provided the previous terms. Wait, actually, looking back, the problem says \"TEST: Can we find a, b such that k\u2099 = a\u00d7k\u2099\u208b\u2081 + b\u00d7k\u2099\u208b\u2082?\" and then gives the equations for k\u2087 and k\u2088. So maybe the previous terms before k\u2087 and k\u2088 are known? For instance, k\u2086 is 49 and k\u2085 is 21? Otherwise, how can they write the equations? \n\nLet me check the exact problem statement again. \n\nThe user says: \n\n\"For k7 = 76:\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n224 = 76a + 49b\"\n\nAh, okay, so they have given that when calculating k\u2087, the previous two terms are 49 and 21. So that means k\u2086 = 49 and k\u2085 =21? Wait, but to get k\u2087, we need k\u2086 and k\u2085. Similarly, to get k\u2088, we need k\u2087 and k\u2086. So, the user is assuming that the two terms before 76 are 49 and 21. \n\nTherefore, the equations are set up as follows:\n\nk\u2087 = a\u00d7k\u2086 + b\u00d7k\u2085 \u2192 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721,\n\nk\u2088 = a\u00d7k\u2087 + b\u00d7k\u2086 \u2192 224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749.\n\nSo, now we have two equations with two variables a and b. The problem is to solve this system of equations and see if a and b are integers. \n\nLet me write them again:\n\n1) 49a + 21b = 76\n\n2) 76a + 49b = 224\n\nWe need to solve for a and b. Let's see. \n\nFirst, maybe simplify the first equation. Let's see if there's a common factor. \n\nEquation 1: 49a + 21b = 76. The coefficients 49 and 21 have a common factor of 7. Let's divide through by 7:\n\n49a /7 =7a, 21b /7=3b, 76/7 is not an integer. Hmm, that complicates things. Maybe not the best approach. \n\nAlternatively, let's use the elimination method. Let's try to eliminate one variable. Let's try to eliminate 'a' first. To do that, multiply the first equation by 76 and the second equation by 49 so that the coefficients of 'a' will be 49\u00d776 and 76\u00d749, which are the same. Then subtract them? Wait, actually, let me think again. \n\nWait, equation 1: 49a +21b =76\n\nEquation 2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me label them as Eq1 and Eq2.\n\nLet's try to multiply Eq1 by 49 and Eq2 by 21, so that the coefficients of b will be 21\u00d749 and 49\u00d721, then subtract? Wait:\n\nWait, if we want to eliminate 'b', let's see:\n\nMultiply Eq1 by 49:\n\n49*(49a) +49*(21b) =49*76 \u2192 49\u00b2 a + (21\u00d749)b =49\u00d776\n\nMultiply Eq2 by 21:\n\n21*(76a) +21*(49b)=21*224 \u2192 (21\u00d776)a + (21\u00d749)b =21\u00d7224\n\nNow subtract the two equations:\n\n[49\u00b2 a + (21\u00d749)b] - [(21\u00d776)a + (21\u00d749)b] = 49\u00d776 -21\u00d7224\n\nThe terms with b cancel out:\n\n49\u00b2 a - (21\u00d776)a = 49\u00d776 -21\u00d7224\n\nFactor out 'a':\n\na*(49\u00b2 -21\u00d776) = 49\u00d776 -21\u00d7224\n\nCompute the coefficients:\n\nFirst, compute 49\u00b2: 49\u00d749 = 2401\n\n21\u00d776: Let's see, 20\u00d776=1520, 1\u00d776=76, so total 1520+76=1596\n\nSo denominator term: 2401 -1596 = 805\n\nRight side: 49\u00d776 -21\u00d7224\n\nCompute 49\u00d776: 50\u00d776=3800, minus 1\u00d776=76 \u2192 3800-76=3724\n\n21\u00d7224: 20\u00d7224=4480, 1\u00d7224=224 \u2192 4480+224=4704\n\nThus, right side: 3724 -4704 = -980\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\na*(805) = -980 \u2192 a = -980 /805\n\nSimplify this fraction. Let's see, both numbers are divisible by 5:\n\n-980 \u00f75 = -196; 805 \u00f75 =161\n\nSo a = -196 /161. Hmm, that's a fraction. Not an integer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation here. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, so:\n\nLeft side after subtraction:\n\n49\u00b2 a - (21\u00d776)a = (49\u00b2 -21\u00d776)a\n\n49\u00b2 is 2401, 21\u00d776=1596, so 2401-1596=805. Correct.\n\nRight side:\n\n49\u00d776: 49\u00d770=3430, 49\u00d76=294 \u2192 3430+294=3724. Correct.\n\n21\u00d7224: 224\u00d720=4480, plus 224=4704. Correct. So 3724-4704= -980. Correct.\n\nSo a = -980 /805. Hmm. Let me see if this reduces further.\n\n-196/161. Let's check GCD of 196 and 161.\n\nFactors of 196: 2\u00d72\u00d77\u00d77\n\nFactors of 161: 7\u00d723\n\nSo GCD is 7. So divide numerator and denominator by 7:\n\n-196 \u00f77 = -28; 161 \u00f77 =23. \n\nThus, a = -28/23 \u2248 -1.217. Not an integer. \n\nHmm, so that suggests a is a fraction. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to eliminate 'b' instead?\n\nLet me try another approach. Let me use the elimination method again but maybe a different way.\n\nLet me call the equations:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me try to eliminate 'b'. To do that, we can multiply equation1 by 49 and equation2 by 21, then subtract. Wait, that's what I did before, leading to the same result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply equation1 by something else. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote the coefficients:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me try to express both equations in terms of a and b. Maybe solve one equation for a in terms of b and substitute into the other.\n\nFrom equation1: 49a =76 -21b \u2192 a = (76 -21b)/49\n\nSubstitute this into equation2:\n\n76*( (76 -21b)/49 ) +49b =224\n\nCompute this:\n\n(76*76)/49 - (76*21b)/49 +49b =224\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n76 squared: 76*76. Let me compute that. 70\u00b2=4900, 2*70*6=840, 6\u00b2=36, so (70+6)^2=4900 +840 +36= 5776. So 76\u00b2=5776. \n\nThen 5776 /49. Let me see 49\u00d7118 is 49*(100+18)=4900+882=5782. Hmm, that's over. 49\u00d7117=49*(100+17)=4900+833=5733. 5776-5733=43, so 5776=49\u00d7117 +43. Hmm, so that's a fraction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this approach is getting too messy. Maybe let me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: 76*( (76 -21b)/49 ) = (76\u00d776)/49 - (76\u00d721b)/49\n\nSecond term: +49b\n\nSo altogether:\n\n(76\u00d776)/49 - (76\u00d721b)/49 +49b =224\n\nLet me combine the terms with b:\n\n- (76\u00d721 /49) b +49b = [ - (76\u00d721)/49 +49 ] b\n\nLet me compute coefficients:\n\nFirst, 76\u00d721 = 1596, so (1596)/49. Let me divide 1596 by 49:\n\n49\u00d732 = 1568, 1596 -1568=28. So 1596/49=32 +28/49=32 +4/7=32.571...\n\nSo:\n\n- (1596/49)b +49b = (-1596/49 +49) b\n\nConvert 49 to 49/1:\n\n= [ -1596/49 + (49\u00d749)/49 ] b = [ (49\u00b2 -1596)/49 ] b\n\nCompute 49\u00b2 is 2401. 2401 -1596 = 805. So:\n\n(805 /49) b\n\nTherefore the equation becomes:\n\n(76\u00b2)/49 + (805 /49) b =224\n\nWait, actually, let's track again:\n\nWait, the entire equation was:\n\n[ (76\u00d776)/49 ] - (76\u00d721b)/49 +49b =224\n\nWhich rearranged:\n\n(76\u00b2)/49 + [ - (76\u00d721)/49 +49 ] b =224\n\nYes, so that is (5776)/49 + (805/49)b =224\n\nFactor out 1/49:\n\n[5776 + 805b]/49 =224\n\nMultiply both sides by49:\n\n5776 +805b =224\u00d749\n\nCompute 224\u00d749: Let's see 200\u00d749=9800, 24\u00d749=1176, so total 9800+1176=10976\n\nThus:\n\n5776 +805b =10976\n\nSubtract 5776:\n\n805b =10976 -5776=5200\n\nThus:\n\nb=5200/805\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n5200 \u00f75=1040; 805 \u00f75=161\n\nSo b=1040/161. Let's see if this reduces further.\n\nCheck GCD of 1040 and 161.\n\nFactor 161 is 7\u00d723.\n\nFactor 1040: 10\u00d7104=10\u00d78\u00d713=2\u00d75\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d713. So primes are 2^4\u00d75\u00d713. 161 is 7\u00d723. No common factors. So b=1040/161 \u22486.46.\n\nHmm, so b is also a fraction. Since both a and b come out as fractions, that suggests there are no integer solutions for a and b. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra somewhere? Let me check the substitution again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try solving using another method. Let me try to set up the equations again:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b =76\n\nEquation2:76a +49b=224\n\nLet me try to solve equation1 for a:\n\nFrom Equation1: 49a =76 -21b \u2192 a=(76 -21b)/49\n\nNow plug into equation2:\n\n76*( (76 -21b)/49 ) +49b =224\n\nLet me compute 76*(76 -21b)/49:\n\n= (76*76)/49 - (76*21b)/49\n\n= (5776)/49 - (1596b)/49\n\nThen adding 49b:\n\nSo total equation:\n\n5776/49 -1596b/49 +49b =224\n\nCombine the b terms:\n\n-1596b/49 +49b = (-1596b +49*49b)/49\n\nCompute 49*49 =2401\n\nThus:\n\n(-1596b +2401b)/49 = (805b)/49\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n5776/49 + (805b)/49 =224\n\nMultiply both sides by 49:\n\n5776 +805b =224*49 =10976\n\nSo 805b =10976 -5776 =5200 \u2192 same as before. So b=5200/805 \u22486.46. \n\nHmm, so same result. So that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the numbers? But assuming the numbers given are correct, then the conclusion is that there are no integer solutions for a and b. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows a and b to be fractions? But the problem says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So they specifically want integers. \n\nHence, since both a and b are fractions, not integers, so the answer would be no, there are no integers a and b that satisfy the recurrence for these terms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if there was a miscalculation in the problem setup. Let me check the given equations again.\n\nGiven k\u2087=76, which is supposed to be equal to a\u00d7k\u2086 +b\u00d7k\u2085. The problem states that this is 49a +21b=76. So that would mean k\u2086=49 and k\u2085=21? Wait, but where do these numbers come from?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. The user just presented the equations 49a +21b=76 and 76a +49b=224, but actually, the problem might have been presented differently. Wait, let me read again:\n\nThe user's question is: \"F: Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nF: If I have the following system of equations:\n\n49a + 21b = 76\n\n76a + 49b = 224\n\nCan you solve for integers a and b?\"\n\nWait, actually, the user might have presented the equations directly. So the equations are as written, so the problem is to solve for integers a and b in the system:\n\n49a +21b =76\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nSo in that case, my previous calculations are correct, leading to fractional solutions. Hence, no integer solutions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me try to subtract the equations or do something else.\n\nLet me denote equation1 and equation2:\n\nEquation1:49a +21b =76 \u2192 multiply both sides by 1\n\nEquation2:76a +49b =224 \u2192 multiply both sides by 1\n\nLet me try to subtract equation1 from equation2:\n\n(76a -49a) + (49b -21b) =224 -76\n\nSo 27a +28b =148\n\nSo 27a =148 -28b \u2192 a=(148 -28b)/27\n\nHmm, perhaps this is easier to handle. Let me see if a is integer for some integer b.\n\nSo a=(148 -28b)/27 must be integer. Let me set (148 -28b) divisible by27. Let me write this as:\n\n148 \u226128b mod27\n\nLet me compute 148 mod27: 27*5=135, 148-135=13 \u2192148\u226113 mod27\n\n28 mod27=1 \u219228\u22611 mod27\n\nThus equation becomes:\n\n13 \u22611*b mod27 \u2192 b\u226113 mod27\n\nThus, b=27k +13 for some integer k.\n\nThus, substituting back into equation a=(148 -28b)/27\n\n= (148 -28*(27k +13))/27\n\n= (148 -28*27k -28*13)/27\n\nCompute 28*13=364, so:\n\n= (148 -364 -28*27k)/27\n\n= (-216 -28*27k)/27\n\n= (-216)/27 -28k\n\n= -8 -28k\n\nThus, a= -8 -28k, and b=27k +13.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are parametrized by integer k:\n\na= -8 -28k,\n\nb=13 +27k.\n\nSo now, substitute into one of the original equations to see if there exists an integer k such that both a and b satisfy the first equation.\n\nLet me check equation1:49a +21b =76.\n\nSubstitute a and b:\n\n49*(-8 -28k) +21*(13 +27k)=?\n\nCalculate term by term:\n\n49*(-8)= -392,\n\n49*(-28k)= -1372k,\n\n21*13=273,\n\n21*27k=567k,\n\nThus total:\n\n-392 -1372k +273 +567k = (-392+273) + (-1372k +567k)\n\n= -119 -805k\n\nSet equal to76:\n\n-119 -805k =76 \u2192 -805k =76 +119=195 \u2192k= -195/805\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: -39/161\n\nWhich is not integer. So no solution.\n\nAlternatively, check equation2:\n\n76a +49b =224\n\nSubstitute a and b:\n\n76*(-8 -28k) +49*(13 +27k)=?\n\n76*(-8)= -608,\n\n76*(-28k)= -2128k,\n\n49*13=637,\n\n49*27k=1323k,\n\nTotal:\n\n-608 -2128k +637 +1323k = (-608+637)+ (-2128k +1323k)\n\n=29 -805k\n\nSet equal to224:\n\n29 -805k =224 \u2192 -805k =224 -29=195 \u2192k= -195/805 same as before.\n\nSo no integer k satisfies this. \n\nTherefore, there are no integer solutions for a and b. \n\nHence the answer is that there are no integer solutions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows real numbers? But the question specifically asks for integers. \n\nTherefore, the system has no solution in integers. \n\nHence the final answer is that there are no integers a and b satisfying the equations, so the answer is no solution. \n\nBut since the user asks to put the final answer in boxed, maybe they want to state \"no solution\" in boxed, or perhaps I miscalculated?\n\nWait let me recheck all steps once more.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if there is any possible integer solution.\n\nSuppose a and b are integers. Let me try small integer values.\n\nFrom equation1:49a +21b =76. Let's see possible a and b.\n\nWe can write this as 7*(7a +3b)=76. Since 76 is not divisible by7 (7*10=70, 7*11=77), so LHS is divisible by7 but RHS is 76 not divisible by7, which is impossible. \n\nWait, this is a key point. 49a +21b =7*(7a +3b)=76. Since 7 divides the left-hand side but 76 is not divisible by7, this equation has no solution over integers.\n\nTherefore, the first equation is impossible to satisfy with integers a and b, so the system has no solution. \n\nTherefore, this is a quicker way to see it. \n\nSince 7 divides 49a +21b, but 76 is not divisible by7. 76 divided by7 is 10 with remainder6. Hence, the first equation is impossible. Therefore, no solution exists. \n\nSo the conclusion is correct, no integer solution. \n\nTherefore, the answer is there is no solution, so the boxed answer is \\boxed{\\text{No solution}}.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects to write in terms of a and b but since there is no solution, maybe present that. But sometimes, in some contexts, maybe fractions are considered, but the question specifies integers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, but with the given numbers, there is no solution. \n\nHence the final answer is no solution, boxed as instructed.\n",
