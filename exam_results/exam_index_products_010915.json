The problem states: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" It's not entirely clear what is being asked exactly.\n\nWe have keys: k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, and k12. They are numbers apparently computed by some formula? But it says \"CHECK:\" then lists:\n\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo the keys: \nk7 = 76, k8 = 224, k9 = 467, k11 = 1155, and k12 = 2683.\nAlso earlier: \"OBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\". Not sure what is provided.\n\nUser says: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" The hypothesis: sometimes the index appears in the formula. And it's proposed that maybe k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). So we want to compute f(n), maybe as (k_n - g(n))/n, but then question is: given keys numbers and indices maybe they are from a sequence? Let me check what possible pattern.\n\nMaybe \"k7\" means key with index 7 equals some product of factors? Possibly it's the series like k2, k3, etc. I see that for k8 we have f(8)=28 because k8/8=224/8 = 28; and for k11, f(11) is 1155/11 = 105. For k12, they computed k8*12 -5 = 2683, but then dividing by 12 gives a non integer quotient 223.58.\n\nMaybe there's pattern: Possibly if we try to guess something like \"k_n = (something) * n + (something else)\", and f(n)=? Maybe the hypothesis is that for some indices (like 7,9, etc.) k_n might not follow this linear formula with integer quotient but for others it does.\n\nWait, let me re-read carefully: \"CHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\n\nSo the pattern might be: For some indices, when you divide by n, you get an integer f(n), and for others not. They are asking \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Perhaps f(2)? f(3)? But we have keys for 7,8,9,11,12; maybe also k5? Possibly the pattern is that when you divide k_n by n sometimes yields an integer (like for n=8 and n=11). So for those indices, f(n) = k_n / n. So then:\nFor k8: f(8)=224/8=28.\nFor k11: f(11)=1155/11=105.\n\nWhat about others? They give approximations for k7 and k9 that are not integer divisions. But maybe we need to compute f(n) as floor division or something?\n\nMaybe the pattern is \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\", where f(n) can be computed by some product of previous keys? Possibly the idea: sometimes k_n involves a multiplication with an index (like 12 appears in formula for k12). For instance, k12 = k8 * 12 - 5. So maybe there is pattern like that.\n\nWait \"OBSERVED:\" line: \"- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\". That suggests that the product of keys at indices 2 and 3 equals k5? Let's check: Possibly k2=? But we don't know these values, but maybe they are computed from a sequence. For example, if we assume Fibonacci-like or something? Not sure.\n\nWe have keys for n=7,8,9,11,12. And given that, perhaps the pattern is: f(n)=? It might be that k_n / n yields a number sometimes. So I can list them:\nn: key (if available) and then f(n) = k_n/n if it divides evenly.\n\nWe have:\n\nFor n=7: k7 = 76, so 76/7 is not integer, so maybe the linear formula doesn't hold.\nFor n=8: k8 = 224, and 224/8=28 exactly. So f(8)=28.\nFor n=9: k9 = 467, but 467/9 \u2248 51.888... not integer.\nFor n=11: k11 =1155, and 1155/11=105 exactly so f(11)=105.\nFor n=12: k12=2683, and 2683/12 is not integer (223.58333). But note that they computed using another pattern: k8\u00d712-5 gives 224*12 - 5 = 2688 -5 = 2683; so maybe then f(n) doesn't apply? Wait, the hypothesis was \"sometimes the index itself appears in the formula\", and we see for n=12 it's not a simple linear factor but instead a product with k8.\n\nThe user is asking: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Perhaps they want to extract the multiplier part when expressed as k_n = f(n)*n + remainder. But then what about remainder g(n)? The question might be ambiguous.\n\nMaybe it's like: if you try writing k_n in the form of a linear function in n, k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then what is f(n) for each key? We have computed:\nFor k7: f(7)= floor division maybe 10 with remainder? Actually, let me check: If we assume that pattern k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) for some function of n where f(n) and g(n) are constant or follow a pattern. Then for the keys that yield an integer quotient when divided by their index, like k8=224 so f(8)=28 exactly, and k11=1155 gives f(11)=105 exactly. For k7: 76/7 = 10 remainder 6? Actually 7*10 =70, then remainder 6, so maybe f(7) might be 10 if we assume integer division rounding down. But the check says \"not clean\" for k7. And for k9: 467/9 gives quotient 51 remainder 8 because 9*51=459, remainder 8, but not whole? Possibly we want to compute f(n)=k_n div n (i.e. integer division) and g(n)= remainder.\n\nSo maybe the answer is:\nFor each key:\n- k5: unknown? Not provided.\n- k7: 76 = 10*7 + 6 so f(7)=10, g(7)=6.\n- k8: 224 = 28*8 + 0, so f(8)=28, g(8)=0.\n- k9: 467 = 51*9 + 8, so f(9)=51, g(9)=8.\n- k11:1155=105*11+0, so f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\n- k12:2683; if we try to do integer division 2683/12 = 223 remainder 7 (because 223*12=2676 and remainder is 7) but then they mention another pattern: k8\u00d712 -5. But maybe that's not the representation as f(n)*n + g(n). Instead, note that for n=12, if we force it into the form, it would be f(12)=223, g(12)=7, because 223*12=2676 then plus remainder 7 equals 2683.\n\nSo answer: \nk7: f(7) = 10,\nk8: f(8) = 28,\nk9: f(9) = 51,\nk11: f(11)=105,\nk12: f(12)=223, if we take integer division. But then check: k12=2683 does not appear to be a multiple of 12 exactly.\n\nI also note that the \"observed\" line says \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\". So maybe there's pattern with index multiplication. Possibly they want us to calculate f(n) as derived from a division by n, and then see if it relates to previous keys.\n\nMaybe we can also attempt to guess f(5)? But we don't know k5 value? It says \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\", so perhaps k2 and k3 are known? For instance, maybe the sequence is like: k1, k2, ... If k5 equals product of k2 and k3, then what are k2 and k3? Possibly they follow a pattern: if we assume that for some indices the multiplication factor f(n) = ? Maybe it's part of a recurrence.\n\nI need to re-read the text: \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\" maybe implies there is some product structure with index. We have: \n- Observed: k5 equals the product of k2 and k3? That might be a coincidence if we assume indices are added or multiplied in a pattern.\n- Also, k12 equals (k8\u00d712 - 5). So that suggests that sometimes the index is used as a multiplier to one of the keys, then subtracting something.\n\nMaybe f(n) is computed as floor(k_n/n)? But maybe it's not about integer division; maybe we are supposed to extract the \"coefficient\" in front of n when representing k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). And from the checks, for some indices (8 and 11), this quotient is an integer. For others (7,9,12) it is not.\n\nMaybe the pattern: \nk7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 \u2248 10.857 so f(7) might be approximately 10.86? But then k8 gives exactly 28; k9 gives approx 51.89; k11=105; k12 ~223.58? Wait, check: they did:\nk7 = 76 \u2192 76/7 \u2248 10.8571, \nk8 =224 \u2192 224/8=28,\nk9=467 \u2192 467/9\u224851.8889,\nk11=1155\u21921155/11=105,\nk12=2683\u21922683/12=223.5833.\nMaybe f(n) for k_n is not simply integer division; maybe it's exactly k_n/n if that quotient is an integer, and otherwise it's just the decimal value.\n\nBut then they check: \"but k8\u00d712-5=2683\", so that means for k12 there is a different representation than simple linear form. So perhaps the answer is: f(7)=76/7, f(8)=28, f(9)=467/9, f(11)=105, and f(12)=? But then we see inconsistency.\n\nLet me check the pattern: For k8 and k11, it works perfectly as linear function with integer multiplier. For k7 and k9, maybe not.\nMaybe we can try to identify a potential sequence formula for these keys. Possibly they are something like: \nk2, k3, etc. The product relation: k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. And then k8=28*8. So perhaps the pattern is that sometimes f(n) might be computed as f(n)=? Possibly it's related to factorial or binomial coefficients? For instance, 7, 224, etc.\n\nMaybe we can guess: k8=224 = 7 * 32, but not sure.\n\nI note:\nk7=76\nk8=224\nk9=467\nk11=1155\nk12=2683\n\nMaybe these are the numbers of a known sequence? They look like they might be \"prime\" or something? \n- 76 is composite (2^2*19), but not sure.\n- 224=7*32, interestingly that's 28*8 as computed,\n- 467 is prime maybe? Actually 467 factors: it is prime I believe. \n- 1155 = 3 * 5 *7*11? Because 1155= 3*385=3*5*77 =3*5*7*11, yes.\n- 2683 is also composite? Let me check: 2683 mod ? Possibly 2683= 19*141.21 no.\n\nI suspect that the sequence might be \"index product\" meaning each k_n might be something like (something) * n + (something else). And they are trying to see if f(n)=k_n/n sometimes is an integer, and in those cases maybe it's a pattern: 28 for n=8 and 105 for n=11. Then what's the relation? Perhaps f(2)? f(3)? And then k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 means that  (f(2)*2 + g(2)) * (f(3)*3+g(3)) equals something like f(5)*5+g(5). That might lead to a relation between the functions.\n\nThe hypothesis: sometimes the index appears in the formula. They've checked for n=7,8,9,11,12. And they found that dividing k_n by n gives:\nk7/n = 76/7 \u2248 10.8571,\nk8/n = 28 (exact),\nk9/n = 467/9 \u2248 51.8889,\nk11/n = 105 (exact),\nk12/n = 2683/12 \u2248 223.5833.\n\nMaybe we can look at the differences: \nFor n=7, f(7)= maybe 10.8571, for n=8, f(8)=28, then for n=9, f(9)=51.8889. The difference between these approximate values is not obvious.\nBetween n=8 and n=11, f(8)=28 and f(11)=105; the ratio 105/28 = 3.75? Not sure.\n\nMaybe we can compute each quotient exactly:\nk7/n = 76/7 = 10 + 6/7 = 10.857142857...\nk8/n = 224/8 = 28 exactly.\nk9/n = 467/9, remainder: 9*51=459, so it's 51 + 8/9 \u2248 51.888888889.\nk11/n = 1155/11 =105 exactly.\nk12/n = 2683/12, remainder: 12*223=2676, remainder 7, so it's 223 + 7/12 \u2248223.5833333.\n\nMaybe these fractions are significant. For instance, 76/7 can be simplified? No, it is irreducible.\n467/9 also is irreducible? Likely yes.\n2683/12 simplifies if numerator divisible by something? Possibly not.\n\nGiven the data, maybe answer: \nFor k7, f(7)=10 with remainder 6 (if using integer division) or exactly 76/7 in rational form.\nFor k8, f(8)=28 exactly.\nFor k9, f(9)=51 with remainder 8.\nFor k11, f(11)=105 exactly.\nFor k12, if you try to force linear representation, you get f(12)=223 with remainder 7.\n\nBut the question says \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" and then shows a check: \"k_n = ? \u00d7 n + ?\". It might be that the answer is simply:\n- f(7) = 76/7 \u2248 10.857,\n- f(8) = 28,\n- f(9) = 467/9 \u2248 51.889,\n- f(11) = 105,\n- f(12) = 2683/12 \u2248223.583.\n\nBut then what is the role of \"k5=k2\u00d7k3\"? Possibly there's another pattern: maybe if you compute k5/n for n=5, it would be something like (k2 * k3)/5. If we had values for k2 and k3, we could compute f(5) = k5/5.\n\nMaybe the answer is that only sometimes does the index appear as a multiplier (i.e., when k_n/n is an integer). In those cases, f(n) equals that integer.\nThus: \nf(7)=10.857142857...,\nf(8)=28,\nf(9)=51.888888889,\nf(11)=105.\n\nAnd then note the anomaly for n=12 where instead of k_n/n, we have k8\u00d712-5, which gives 2683.\nSo answer: \nFor each key:\nk7 = (10 + 6/7) * 7, so f(7)=76/7,\nk8 = 28*8, so f(8)=28,\nk9 = (51 + 8/9)*9, so f(9)=467/9,\nk11 = 105*11, so f(11)=105,\nk12 = (223 + 7/12)*12, so f(12)=2683/12.\n\nI could also express them as fractions:\nf(7) = 76/7,\nf(8) = 28,\nf(9) = 467/9,\nf(11) = 105,\nf(12) = 2683/12.\nThat might be the intended answer.\n\nBut perhaps they want f(n) to be computed exactly: \nFor k7, since 76/7 is not an integer, maybe we consider f(7)=\u230a76/7\u230b = 10 and g(7)=6.\nSimilarly for k9, f(9)=51 and g(9)=8;\nand for k12, f(12)=223 and g(12)=7.\n\nThe problem statement \"Calculate f(n)\" is ambiguous. However, the checks given (\"? \u00d7 n + ?\") suggest that they want to represent each key as a product plus remainder. So I'll provide both interpretations: exact rational quotient and integer division.\n\nI lean towards providing the answers in the form:\nk7 = (76/7)*7, so f(7)=76/7 \u2248 10.8571; if using division with remainder, then quotient is 10 and remainder 6.\nSimilarly, k8 = 28*8, so f(8)=28 exactly;\nk9 = (467/9)*9, so f(9)=467/9 \u224851.8889; integer division gives quotient 51, remainder 8;\nk11 = 105*11, so f(11)=105 exactly;\nand k12 = (2683/12)*12, so f(12)=2683/12 \u2248223.5833; integer division yields quotient 223, remainder 7.\n\nI need to decide which interpretation is more likely intended by the question \"Calculate f(n)\" in a problem that says \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\". Possibly they want to see if k_n/n sometimes gives an integer value (which happens for n=8 and n=11) and sometimes not, so maybe answer: \nFor n=7, f(7)=10.8571; n=8, f(8)=28; n=9, f(9)=51.8889; n=11, f(11)=105; n=12, f(12)=223.5833.\n\nMaybe also include the observation that when k_n can be written as an integer times n (i.e., with no remainder), then that integer is a candidate for f(n). In our case, k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 =105\u00d711 are such cases.\n\nI'll provide the answer in clear bullet points.\n\nThus my final answer:\n\nFor each key:\n- For k7=76: When written as (f(7))*7 + g(7), f(7) = 76/7 \u2248 10.8571, and if you take integer division then f(7)=10 with remainder 6.\n- For k8=224: It equals 28\u00d78 exactly, so f(8)=28.\n- For k9=467: It can be written as (f(9))*9 + g(9) where f(9)=467/9 \u2248 51.8889; with integer division, quotient is 51 and remainder 8.\n- For k11=1155: It equals 105\u00d711 exactly, so f(11)=105.\n- For k12=2683: Written as (f(12))*12 + g(12), we have f(12) = 2683/12 \u2248223.5833; using integer division, quotient is 223 with remainder 7.\n\nI could also note that for n=8 and n=11, the form k_n = f(n)*n holds exactly, suggesting a special role of these indices in the pattern.\n\nI'll now produce my answer accordingly in plain text.</think>One acceptable way to \u201cread\u201d the pattern was to try writing each key number k\u2099 in the form\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n)\n\nand then ask: when is f(n) an integer? (In other words, can we \u201cabsorb\u201d the index n into a multiplier?) One may check that for some keys this works out exactly while for others it does not.\n\nFor example, suppose you have\n\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2087 = 76. Dividing by 7 gives\n\u2003\u200376/7 \u2248 10.8571\u2003\u2003or, if you use integer division, 10 with a remainder of 6.\nSo one may write\n\u2003\u200376 = (76/7)\u00b77 + 0\u2003\u2003(or equivalently 76 = 10\u00b77 + 6).\n\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2088 = 224. Here 224/8 = 28 exactly so that\n\u2003\u2003224 = 28\u00b78 + 0.\nThus f(8) = 28.\n\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2089 = 467. Dividing by 9 gives\n\u2003\u2003467/9 \u2248 51.8889, i.e. 9\u00d751 = 459 with a remainder of 8.\nSo one may write\n\u2003\u2003467 = (467/9)\u00b79 + 0\u2003\u2003(or 467 = 51\u00b79 + 8).\n\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 1155. Since 1155/11 = 105 exactly,\n\u2003\u20031155 = 105\u00b711 + 0.\nThus f(11) = 105.\n\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2081\u2082 is given (or can be checked) to equal 2683. Dividing by 12 gives\n\u2003\u20032683/12 \u2248 223.5833, that is 12\u00d7223 = 2676 with a remainder of 7.\nSo one may write\n\u2003\u20032683 = (2683/12)\u00b712 + 0\u2003\u2003(or 2683 = 223\u00b712 + 7).\n\nAn alternative way to state the answer is as follows:\n\n\u2003For each key we have\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2087 = 76\u2003\u2003= (76\u20447)\u00b77\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003or, using integer division, 10\u00d77 + 6.\n\u2003\u2003k\u2088 = 224\u2003\u2003= 28\u00d78\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003so f(8) = 28.\n\u2003\u2003k\u2089 = 467\u2003\u2003= (467\u20449)\u00b79\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003or, using integer division, 51\u00d79 + 8.\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 1155 = 105\u00d711\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003so f(11) = 105.\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 2683 = (2683\u204412)\u00b712 or, by integer division, 223\u00d712 + 7.\n\nNotice that for k\u2088 and k\u2081\u2081 the number factors exactly as an integer times n. In our \u201cpattern\u2010analysis\u201d this is what one may call a special case where the index appears as a multiplier (that is, f(n) is an integer).\n\nAny answer equivalent to the above \u2013 stating for each key either\n\n\u2003f(7)=76\u20447 (\u224810.8571),\u2003f(8)=28,\u2003f(9)=467\u20449 (\u224851.8889),\u2003f(11)=105,\u2003f(12)=2683\u204412 (\u2248223.5833)\n\nor else giving the quotient\u2013remainder form \u2013 is correct.\n\nTo summarize, one acceptable answer is:\n\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2087 = 76 = (76\u20447)\u00b77\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(or 10\u00d77 + 6)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2088 = 224 = 28\u00d78\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(so f(8)=28)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2089 = 467 = (467\u20449)\u00b79\u2003\u2003\u2003(or 51\u00d79 + 8)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 1155 = 105\u00d711\u2003\u2003\u2003(so f(11)=105)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 2683 = (2683\u204412)\u00b712\u2003\u2003(or 223\u00d712 + 7)\n\nThis is one acceptable \u201csolution\u201d to the problem.",
