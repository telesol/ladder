  "response": "<think>We are asked: \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\" and provided some observations:\n\n- The observed product pattern:\n   - \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\"\n   - \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\"\n\nThen it's stated: \"HYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\" Then check:\n1. \"k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\"\n2. \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\"\n3. \"k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\"\n4. \"k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\"\n5. \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\n\nSo it seems they are trying to see if for some keys, there is a pattern: k_n = f(n)* n + g(n) where the multiplication factor times index plus something equals the key value.\n\nFrom these examples:\nFor k8, we have k8 = 28 * 8 + ? But note: they already computed that f(8) is integer: from k8, if we write k8 = f(8)*8 + g(8), then they say \"k8=224/8=28\", so f(8)=? It says: \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28\" which is computed as integer. So it appears that for k8, maybe f(8) is 28 and g(8)=0? Wait check the text:\n\"2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\" I need to re-read carefully.\n\nIt says: \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" and then it writes \"224/8 = 28 = k8/8\". Possibly this means that when you divide key value by index, for n=8 we get an integer? So maybe f(8) is the factor such that k8 divided by 8 equals an integer? It says \"k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ?\" then \"224/8 = 28\", so perhaps it means that when you subtract something and divide by index, you get a clean number. Wait re-read: They have a check list:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo for some indices, when you do \"key value divided by index\", it gives an integer f(n) and then g(n)=0 perhaps? But check: k11: \"1155/11=105\" that is integer. For n=7: 76/7 \u2260 integer; for n=9: 467/9 not integer; for n=12: 2683/12 is not integer but the product formula says that k8\u00d712-5 = 2683, so then what is f(12)? Possibly f(12) would be something like (k8 \u00d7 12 - 5)/? Wait let's try to re-read the pattern \"k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)\". And they provided examples: for k11 and k8. For k8, if we suppose it is in form: k8 = f(8)*8 + g(8), then from example 2, they have that k8/8=224/8? Wait \"k8= ? \u00d7 8+ ?\" but then \"224/8=28\", so possibly the value of k8 divided by 8 equals 28. So f(8)=28 and g(8)=0.\n\nSimilarly for k11: if k11 = f(11)*11 + g(11), they got 1155/11=105, so then presumably f(11)=105 and g(11)=0? But then wait: The text \"k11 = ? \u00d7 11+ ? \u2192 1155/11=105 (integer!)\" So that suggests maybe the pattern is k_n equals a multiple of n. For instance:\n- k2, k3, etc may not fit though.\nThe examples given are specific keys with indexes: k8 and k11 have integer results when dividing by their index.\n\nFor k12, if we try: \"k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12=223.58...\". So that doesn't yield an integer. But they say \"but k8\u00d712-5=2683\" so maybe there's a relation: for n=12, f(12) equals (k8*? - ?)/n? I'm trying to parse the statement: \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\" So they observed that k12 seems to equal k8 * 12 minus 5.\n\nWe have keys with indices:\nk7=76, k8=224, k9=467, k10=? unknown? k11=1155, k12=2683. And also they mention \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" but note: \"indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no\". Possibly k5 is not equal to product of keys with indices 2 and 3.\n\nWe are asked: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Given hypothesis that k_n = f(n)*n + g(n). But what does the pattern say exactly?\n\nI need more context. Let's try to extract the given keys:\n\nWe see examples:\n- k8 = 224, then maybe k8/8=28, so f(8)=28 and g(8) = 0.\n- k11 = 1155, then 1155/11=105, so f(11)=105 and g(11)=0.\n- k7 = 76, then 76/7 is not integer: 76/7 \u2248 10.857. So maybe that's of form f(7)*7 + g(7). If we guess f(n) might be a sequence? But the question \"Calculate f(n)\" suggests that for each key index, if we write it as f(n)*n + g(n), then f(n) equals something like: f(n)= (k_n - g(n)) / n. And they observed some values come out integer in some cases.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that sometimes the product is with index itself? The hypothesis \"Sometimes the INDEX appears in the formula\" implies that in many keys k_n, maybe you can factor n from a part of the key's value f(n)*n + g(n). And they want to know what f(n) equals for each key.\n\nGiven the pattern: They mention:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\nWait maybe I need to consider the possibility that these keys come from a known puzzle like \"Index Product Pattern\" which might be about keys of some cryptographic scheme or sequence. There's an index n and key value k_n such that for certain indices, k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), where f(n) is sometimes the product of previous terms.\n\nWait maybe these keys are from a famous puzzle \"The Index Product Pattern\" where each key is computed using previous keys? I recall something like: k1=?? maybe. But we only have some examples: k5 = k2 * k3, and k12 = k8*12 - 5, etc.\n\nLet me try to denote the given keys:\nWe are not given values for all keys explicitly except a few indices:\n- k7 = 76\n- k8 = 224\n- k9 = 467\n- k10 is unknown?\n- k11 = 1155\n- k12 = 2683\n\nWait, also \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" but then it says \"(indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\" that line is confusing: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\". Possibly means that you expect k5 to equal k2*k3 if the pattern were consistent with indices adding up to 5. But apparently it doesn't work. But then they check k12 with a formula: \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\", which suggests that maybe there is a product of key from index something and the index number, but with some adjustment.\n\nLet's re-read the original text carefully:\n\n\"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\"\n\n\"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" It seems that they already calculated f(8)=28, f(11)=105, etc.\n\nMaybe we need to derive a general formula: k_n = (k_2 * something)? Possibly the pattern is:\nFor certain indices n, maybe f(n) equals something like product of two smaller keys? For instance, k5 was expected to be k2 * k3, but that didn't hold. However, for k12 it's k8*12 - 5.\n\nWait \"k8\u00d712-5\" is a specific relation: It says k12 = (k8)*12 - 5. That means if we set n=12 then apparently f(12) should be k8? Wait let\u2019s try to match the pattern: We hypothesize that sometimes k_n = f(n) * n + g(n). For n=8, we got f(8)=28 and g(8)=0 because 224/8=28 exactly. For n=11, we got f(11)=105 and g(11)=0 because 1155/11=105 exactly.\n\nFor n=12, if it were of the form k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then dividing by n gives: (2683)/12 = 223.583... That is not an integer, so maybe we try to express it as something like: f(12) * 12 - 5 = 2683, which means f(12)=? Solve: f(12)*12 = 2683+5 = 2688, then f(12)=2688/12=224. So for n=12, maybe we have an expression k_12 = 224 * 12 - 5, so f(12) would be 224 and g(12)=-5.\n\nNow what about k7? 76/7 is not integer, but maybe it fits the form: Let k7 = f(7)*7 + g(7). We want to find integers f(7), g(7) such that f(7)*7 + g(7)=76. Possibly choose f(7)=10 and then g(7)=6? But 10*7+6=70+6=76, so that works with f(7)=10 and g(7)=6.\nFor k9: 467/9 is not integer. We want to express 467 as 51*9 + something? 51*9 =459, remainder 8, so k9 = 51\u00d79+8, hence f(9)=51 and g(9)=8.\n\nNow what about k5? They said \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" but then they mention (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no). It might be that for n=5 the pattern does not hold. But we need to compute f(n) for each key. Let's assume keys: k2, k3, maybe unknown as well.\n\nMaybe we have a table:\nn : k_n\nk1 = ?\nk2 = ?\nk3 = ?\nk4 = ?\nk5 = ? (maybe 76? But wait, they gave k7=76)\nWait re-read the check list. They listed: \nk7 = 76, k8 = 224, k9 = 467, k11=1155, and k12=2683.\nWhat are the keys for indices 2,3,4, etc? The observation \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" suggests that maybe k2 and k3 are defined. Possibly we assume some sequence: Let\u2019s denote f(n) is the factor when you divide k_n by n if possible.\n\nObservations:\n- For n=8, we had an integer result.\n- For n=11, integer result.\n- For n=12, not directly integer but can be expressed as 224*12 - 5.\nFor n=7: 76 = 10\u00d77 + 6.\nFor n=9: 467 = 51\u00d79+8.\n\nMaybe we want to find f(2), f(3), f(4), f(5), f(6) and so on. But we only have explicit values for some keys (k7, k8, k9, k11, k12). And also the observation \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\". That suggests that if we let k2 = A and k3 = B then k5 should be equal to A * B. But they mention \"(indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\" which might indicate that it's not matching because maybe expected index sum: 2+3=5 so product of keys at indices 2 and 3 equals key at index 5, but then that didn't work out \"no\". So maybe the pattern is more complicated.\n\nThe hypothesis \"Sometimes the INDEX appears in the formula\" suggests that for some n, k_n might be computed as f(n)*n + g(n) with one of those being a multiple or difference of another key. For example, k12 = k8*12 - 5 shows that f(12)=k8? Because then if we divide by 12: (k8*12 - 5)/12 = k8 - 5/12 which is not an integer unless k8=28 gives 28-5/12 is not an integer. Wait recalc: If k8=224, then 224*12 = 2688 and subtracting 5 gives 2683. So f(12) would be 2688/12=224 which interestingly equals k8/8? Because we had k8=28*8 so maybe f(12)=224 is like 7 times larger than 28.\nWait check: For n=11, they got f(11)=105 and that came from dividing 1155 by 11. And what's k8/8? That was 28. And 28*3=84, not 105 though.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that sometimes f(n) equals some combination of previous keys' factors or numbers. Let\u2019s try to list the computed ones:\n\nFor n=7: k7 = 76; if we want to express it as f(7)*7 + g(7), one natural factorization is 10*7 +6 (since 76 mod 7 gives remainder 6). So maybe f(7)=10, g(7)=6.\nFor n=8: k8 = 224; then 28*8+0 works. So f(8)=28, g(8)=0.\nFor n=9: k9 = 467; then 51*9+8 gives 459+8=467. So f(9)=51, g(9)=8.\nFor n=11: k11=1155; 105*11=1155 exactly so f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\nFor n=12: k12=2683; if we try to express it as f(n)*n + g(n), then possible candidate is f(12)=224 and g(12)=-5 because 224*12 = 2688 and subtracting 5 gives 2683. But why choose that? Possibly because they noticed k12 equals k8\u00d712 - 5, and since k8/8=28, then maybe f(12)=28*8? Wait no, let's compute: If we want to express k12 in the form f(n)*n + g(n), one might try using the pattern from n=8: f(8)=28. Then maybe for n=12, f(12) = something like f(8)*something? 28*8 =224, and indeed 224*12 -5 gives 2683. So maybe there is a recurrence.\n\nMaybe we guess that f(n) might be computed from earlier keys: For n=7, f(7)=10; for n=8, f(8)=28; then the difference is 18, but not sure.\nFor n=9, f(9)=51 which is 23 more than 28. For n=11, f(11)=105. The ratio of k11 to 11 is 105.\n\nI suspect that the question \"Calculate f(n) for each key\" expects an answer along the lines: \nf(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and f(12)=224.\nBut what about other indices? The checks only list k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. So maybe our answer should be something like:\nFor n=5: f(5) = 6 (if we assume that k5 equals 10*5 +1?) Wait no.\n\nLet's re-read the text carefully to see if there are any clues for other keys: \"OBSERVED: - k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" so presumably k2 and k3 have been computed, but their values are not given explicitly in the check list. It might be that f(2) and f(3) are such that when multiplied they give something like an expression for k5.\n\nMaybe we can assume some initial keys: Possibly k1=?? Maybe k2=? The pattern \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" suggests a multiplicative relationship sometimes.\nAlso, the check list has \"indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no\". That might mean that if you take indices 2 and 3, their sum is 5, but the product of f(2) and f(3) does not equal k5. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to compute f(n) from the formula: \nk_n = (the key at some earlier index) multiplied by n plus an adjustment.\n\nWe have examples:\nn=8: k8 = 28*8 + 0.\nn=12: k12 = 224*12 - 5.\nMaybe there is a pattern where f(n+? ) equals something like f(8)*something. Notice that 224 is 8 times 28, and indeed 224/28=8. And also 105/28 is not an integer though.\n\nWait maybe we check: k11 = 1155; if we try to factor by 11, we get 105 exactly.\nk9 gives f(9)=51, which is 27+24, not sure.\nMaybe the pattern is that sometimes the key can be written as a multiple of n plus an offset, where the multiplier (f(n)) is itself computed from previous keys. For example:\nFor n=12: f(12)= k8*? maybe 28*8 =224.\nFor n=11: f(11)=? Possibly it comes from earlier ones: Maybe f(11)= f(7)+ f(4) or something like that?\nBut we don't have enough information.\n\nLet's re-read the check list lines:\n\"1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\" So they attempted to see if k7 divided by 7 is an integer, and it isn't.\n\"2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713\" They found that for n=8, the division gives exactly 28.\n\"3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\"\n\"4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!) \u2713\"\n\"5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\" So they noticed that if you take k8*12 and subtract 5, you get k12.\n\nSo the ones with a clean division are n=8 and n=11; for n=7 and n=9 the quotient is not an integer. And then for n=12, it's almost integer except we can express it as (k8)*12 -5.\n\nMaybe the answer expects: f(7) = 10, remainder 6; f(8)=28, remainder 0; f(9)=51, remainder 8; f(11)=105, remainder 0; and for n=12, if we force it into the form f(12)*12 + g(12), then f(12)=224, g(12)=-5 (since 224*12 - 5 =2683).\n\nThus \"f(n)\" would be:\n- f(7) = floor(76/7)? But that doesn't match because 76/7 is not an integer.\nMaybe the intended representation is to write each key as a product of n and some factor plus a remainder, where the factor might sometimes coincide with one of the keys divided by its index. For example:\nFor n=7: k7 = 10\u00d77 + 6, so f(7)=10.\nFor n=8: k8 = 28\u00d78 + 0, so f(8)=28.\nFor n=9: k9 = 51\u00d79 + 8, so f(9)=51.\nFor n=11: k11 = 105\u00d711 + 0, so f(11)=105.\nFor n=12: Express k12 as 224\u00d712 -5, so if we want it in the form \"f(n)*n + g(n)\", then f(12) should be 224 and g(12)=-5.\n\nThus answer:\nf(7) = 10\nf(8) = 28\nf(9) = 51\nf(11) = 105\nf(12) = 224\n\nBut the question says \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly meaning for every n, find f(n)= (k_n - g(n)) / n if that fits. But we only have examples where it's integer.\n\nMaybe the answer should be a table:\nn:   k_n:      representation\n7: 76 = 10\u00d77 + 6, so f(7) = 10.\n8: 224 = 28\u00d78 + 0, so f(8)=28.\n9: 467 = 51\u00d79 + 8, so f(9)=51.\n11:1155=105\u00d711+0, so f(11)=105.\n12:2683 cannot be written as an integer times 12 plus a remainder? But they do it as 224\u00d712 -5, so if we force the form \"f(n)*n + g(n)\", then f(12) = 224.\n\nBut wait, k12=2683 is also equal to (k8*12)-5 because k8=224. That might be a clue: maybe sometimes f(n)=k_(n-4)? Because for n=12, that would be k8? Let's check n=11: then k7 would be 76? But 76 does not relate obviously to 105.\n\nMaybe the pattern is not consistent enough to guess further keys. \n\nGiven the text \"Calculate f(n) for each key\", I'll assume they mean \"Identify which keys can be expressed as a multiple of their index (i.e., with g(n)=0)\" and then report those values f(n).\n\nFrom our list, k8 and k11 are such that k8/8=28 and k11/11=105. Also for n=12, if we adjust by -5, then the multiplier becomes 224.\n\nThe question might be: \"How do you get f(7), f(8), f(9), f(11)?\" The answer is simply by dividing k_n by n and ignoring the remainder if any. For those that divide evenly, f(n)=k_n / n; for others, maybe choose the nearest integer? But then 76/7 \u224810.857 so not exactly an integer.\n\nMaybe they want to know: \"k8 = (k8/8)*8\" and \"k11 = (k11/11)*11\". And then \"k12 can be written as k8*12 - 5\". \n\nI suspect the intended answer is:\nf(7) = 10, f(8) = 28, f(9) = 51, f(11)=105, and f(12) = 224 (with an adjustment term of -5). \nAlternatively, they might want: f(n) is defined by the relation k_n = f(n)*n + r(n), where r(n) is some remainder. For n=8 and n=11, r(n)=0, so f(8)=28 and f(11)=105; for n=12, writing it as 224*12 - 5, we see that if you want to keep the form f(n)*n + r(n), then f(12) = 224 with r(12)=-5.\n\nI might also mention: \"For k7 and k9, the quotient is not an integer.\"\n\nThus answer:\nf(7)=10 (with remainder 6),\nf(8)=28 (exact),\nf(9)=51 (with remainder 8),\nf(11)=105 (exact),\nf(12)=224 (if expressed as f(12)*12 -5, so with remainder -5).\n\nI need to check consistency: \nFor k7=76, if we divide by 7, quotient is 10 with remainder 6. \nk8=224 divided by 8 gives 28 exactly.\nk9=467 divided by 9 gives 51 remainder 8 (because 51*9 =459, plus 8 =467).\nk11=1155/11 gives 105 exactly.\nFor k12=2683, if we try to see if it divides evenly: 2683 /12 =224.41666..., but notice that 224*12=2688, and subtracting 5 gives 2683, so f(12)=224 with a correction of -5.\n\nThus final answer: \nf(7) = 10; \nf(8) = 28; \nf(9) = 51; \nf(11) = 105; \nand for k12, writing it as 2683=224*12-5, we have f(12)=224.\n\nI think that's the expected answer. I'll now produce a final answer in plain text.</think>One acceptable way to \u201cfactor\u2010out\u201d an index is to write each key k\u2099 in the form\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + r(n)\n\nwhere f(n) is the \u201ccoefficient\u201d (which sometimes comes out as an integer) and r(n) is a remainder. In our example the keys we were given are:\n\n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2087 = 76  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2088 = 224  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2089 = 467  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 1155  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 2683\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens when we try to write each one in the form above.\n\n1. For n = 7:\n\u2003Divide 76 by 7. One finds\n\u2003\u200376 \u00f7 7 \u2248 10.857,\nso if we take f(7) = 10 then\n\u2003\u200310\u00b77 = 70\u2003and\u2003r(7) = 76 \u2013 70 = 6.\nThus, k\u2087 = 10\u00b77 + 6.\n\n2. For n = 8:\n\u2003Divide 224 by 8:\n\u2003\u2003224 \u00f7 8 = 28 exactly,\nso we may take f(8) = 28 and r(8) = 0.\nThat is, k\u2088 = 28\u00b78 + 0.\n\n3. For n = 9:\n\u2003Divide 467 by 9:\n\u2003\u2003467 \u00f7 9 \u2248 51.888\u2026 \nbut if we take f(9) = 51 then\n\u2003\u200351\u00b79 = 459\u2003and\u2003r(9) = 467 \u2013 459 = 8.\nThus, k\u2089 = 51\u00b79 + 8.\n\n4. For n = 11:\n\u2003Divide 1155 by 11:\n\u2003\u20031155 \u00f7 11 = 105 exactly,\nso we have f(11) = 105 and r(11)=0.\nThat is, k\u2081\u2081 = 105\u00b711 + 0.\n\n5. For n = 12:\n\u2003If you try to divide 2683 by 12 you get\n\u2003\u20032683 \u00f7 12 \u2248 223.583\u2026 \nwhich is not an integer. However, notice that if we use the key k\u2088 (whose \u201ccoefficient\u201d was f(8)=28) then\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = (f(8)*12) \u2013 5 = (28\u00b712) \u2013 5.\nSince 28\u00b712 = 336, subtracting 5 gives 331; that does not match 2683. \nBut here is what was observed in the problem statement: they noticed that\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = k\u2088\u00d712 \u2013 5,\nand since we already had k\u2088 = 224 (that is, if you \u201cabsorb\u201d an extra factor then you might write 224 instead of 28) you can think of it as writing\n\u2003\u20032683 = 224\u00b712 \u2013 5.\nIn other words, one may take f(12) = 224 with a remainder r(12)= \u20135.\n\nTo summarize, one acceptable answer is to say that when writing\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + r(n),\n\nwe have found:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003For n = 7:\u2003f(7) = 10\u2003(with remainder 6)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003For n = 8:\u2003f(8) = 28\u2003(exactly, since 224 = 28\u00b78)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003For n = 9:\u2003f(9) = 51\u2003(with remainder 8)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003For n = 11: f(11)=105 (exactly, since 1155 = 105\u00b711)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003For n = 12: one may write 2683 = 224\u00b712 \u2013 5 so that f(12) = 224 (with \u201cremainder\u201d \u20135)\n\nAny answer equivalent to the above is correct.",
