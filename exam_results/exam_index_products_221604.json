The text suggests that there's a pattern of product indices sometimes. It states \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\" That means maybe for particular n, k_n is expressed as (f(n) * n + g(n)). \n\nWe are asked: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nObservations:\n- It mentions check for various indices: k7, k8, k9, k11, and k12.\n- For index 5, they mention observed \"k5 = k2 * k3\", so that might be a product formula rather than a linear combination? Possibly the pattern is different. But then it says: sometimes the INDEX appears in the formula.\n\nI see we have these observations:\n\"CHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\"\n\nObservations:\n- For index 2, maybe pattern: It's not given but we have \"k8\" and \"k11\" are written as product of f(n)*n with integer results.\nWe see that for index 8, if we assume form: k8 = f(8) * 8 + g(8), then from the check, they say k8/8 equals 28 (because \"224/8=28\"), so maybe f(8)=28 and g(8)=0? Let's check: k8 = 28*8 = 224. Yes.\n- For index 11, similarly, if we assume k11 = f(11)*11 + g(11) then k11/11 equals 105, which is integer so f(11) = 105 and g(11)=0 maybe. But the check said \"1155/11=105\" so indeed f(11) must be 105 (and g(11)=0).\n- For index 12: They gave: k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but then they say \"but k8\u00d712-5=2683\". So maybe they are representing k12 as \"k8*12 - 5\" so then f(12)=? That is not of the form f(n)*n + g(n) with integer quotient unless we see it differently. Let's try: If k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5, and k8=224 then k12=2683, which would correspond to: f(12)*12 + g(12)=2683. And if you set f(12) equal to something? Solve for f(12)? Let's denote f(12) = something integer? \nWe have 2683 mod 12 is what remainder? 12*223=2676, remainder 7. So k12=12\u00d7223 + 7, i.e. f(12)=223 and g(12)=7. But note that then product form: k8*12 -5 = (28 * 12) * 12 - 5? Wait no: Let's recalc: k8*12-5 equals (224)*12 -5=2688-5=2683, correct.\nSo if we consider representation of k12 as f(12)*12 + g(12), then it would be 223*12 +7. So f(12)=223 and g(12)=7. But the pattern is that for some indices n, k_n can be represented in the form f(n) * n + g(n). And we want to compute f(n) for each key.\n\nMaybe the original keys are \"k2, k3, k5, etc.\" They have been computed? Possibly the sequence of keys \"k_n\" is defined by a recurrence relation or pattern. The problem statement is not very clear.\n\nLet's re-read the entire message:\n```\nINDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n```\nI see that they are dividing the keys by their index to check if there is an integer factor, i.e., f(n) = k_n / n maybe for some indices. For indices 7 and 9, the division doesn't yield an integer result. But for indices 8 and 11, it does: k8/8=28, k11/11=105, so apparently f(8)=28 and f(11)=105.\n\nFor index 12, if we use that pattern with \"k_n = f(n)*n\", then we would get f(12) as integer quotient of k12 divided by 12. But k12/12=2683/12 is not an integer (223.58...), so they are considering a different representation: maybe \"f(12)= ? times 12\" and then add some constant to match the given formula? They note that if we use k8, then k12 = k8*12 -5. That implies k12= 28*12*12 -5??? Let's check: Actually, they say \"k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\", which means f(12)= (k8)? Actually, let's re-read: \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\". We already know that k8=224. So k8 \u00d7 12 equals 224\u00d712=2688, then subtracting 5 gives 2683, which is indeed k12. So can we represent k12 as f(12) * 12 + g(12)? Well, if we compare with k12 = k8*12 -5, then notice that k8 = 28, so k8\u00d712-5=28\u00d712^2? That doesn't match the form f(n)*n. Instead, let's set: k12 = (k8) * 12 -5. But if we assume a pattern of k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then for n=12, we can try to express that in terms of known function values? For example, maybe f(12)= something like f(8)? Not sure.\n\nMaybe the hypothesis is that sometimes the index appears as multiplier: for some keys you get a product of an integer and the key's index. And they are asking \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nIt might be that the formula is: k_n = (f(n)) * n + g(n), where f(n) may be expressed in terms of previous keys or indices. The text indicates observed: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" but then also \"k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5\", and then they check for other keys. So maybe we want to compute f(7)= ? because when dividing k7 by 7, you get a non-integer quotient (10.86), so there's remainder possibly.\n\nLet me denote: For index n, if k_n is divisible by n, then we can set g(n)=0 and f(n)=k_n/n. But if not, maybe we want to represent it in the form f(n)*n + remainder, where f(n) might be approximated by floor(k_n/n) or something.\n\nGiven the observed ones:\nFor k7: 76/7 = about 10.857... The nearest integer is 11? If I try writing 76 as 11\u00d77=77, then remainder would be -1; if I use 10, then remainder is 6 (since 10\u00d77=70 and plus 6 equals 76). So k7 = 10*7 + 6. But f(7)=? maybe we want the integer part? For index 9: k9=467. Dividing by 9 gives 51.888... The nearest multiples: 51*9=459, remainder 8; or 52*9=468, remainder -1. So it seems more natural to use quotient = 51 and remainder = 8. For index 11: k11=1155 exactly divisible by 11 gives 105 with no remainder. For index 12: k12=2683. Dividing by 12 yields 223 remainder something: 223*12=2676, remainder 7.\n\nSo it seems that for each n, if we write k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then:\n- f(7)=10 (if we take the quotient as integer division) and g(7)=76 - 70=6.\n- f(8)=28 exactly, g(8)=0\n- f(9)=51 exactly? Check: 51*9=459, remainder 467-459=8, so that fits. But wait check: earlier they said \"k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\" which implies not an integer quotient. So f(9)=51 and g(9)=8.\n- f(11)=105 exactly, remainder 0.\n- f(12)=223 and remainder 7.\n\nAlso check index 5: k5= ? The observed said \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" but then they wrote \"indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no\". So maybe that doesn't fit the form k_n=f(n)*n + g(n). But let's see if we can guess f(5) if we had a value for k5. They mention \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\", so maybe k5 is given by product of keys with indices 2 and 3, but they don't specify k2 and k3? Perhaps earlier in analysis, k2= ? and k3=? \nI see the notation: \"5\u00d7? no\" which is ambiguous.\n\nMaybe I can assume that k_n are some known sequence. Possibly these keys might be related to something like factorial or combinatorial numbers.\n\nLet's try to deduce what could be f(n). The hypothesis is that sometimes the index appears in the formula, i.e., the linear combination representation uses \"n\" as a multiplier. They want us to compute f(n) for each key from the given keys? \n\nIt says: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So maybe we have keys k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, and k12 (and maybe others). But the provided text only shows checks for indices 7, 8, 9, 11, 12. And then \"k8 = 28\u00d78\" and \"k11=105\u00d711\". Also observed: \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" but not in form f(n)*n+g(n).\n\nSo maybe the answer is to present a table:\n\nFor n=7, k7=76, so if we write 76 = 10*7 + 6, then f(7)=10.\nFor n=8, k8=224, so 224 = 28*8 + 0, so f(8)=28.\nFor n=9, k9=467, so 467 = 51*9 + 8, so f(9)=51.\nFor n=11, k11=1155, so 1155 = 105*11 + 0, so f(11)=105.\nFor n=12, k12=2683, and also equals k8\u00d712 - 5. If we try to write that as f(12)*12+g(12), then since k8=28, maybe f(12) is 223 (because 223*12=2676, remainder 7). But wait: The text \"k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5\" might be a hint for computing f(12) if it could be represented in a similar pattern as the others. So likely f(12)=? Let's try to see if there is a relationship between f(n) and n. For n=7, f(7)=10; for n=8, f(8)=28; for n=9, f(9)=51; for n=11, f(11)=105; for n=12, f(12)=223 (if we take the quotient from k12/12). But note: 223 is not an integer multiple of f(8)? Actually 28 is f(8), 105 is f(11), and they mention \"k8\u00d712-5\" which equals 224*12 -5=2683. If I try to express that as f(12)*12 + g(12) then we get f(12)=223 remainder 7.\n\nMaybe the answer is: \nf(2) = ? (not given)\nf(3) = ? (not given)\nf(4) = ? (not given, maybe can be derived from pattern?)\nBut they only explicitly show check for indices 7,8,9,11,12. So likely answer: f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and f(12)=223.\n\nI wonder if there is a more general formula? It might be that f(n) = (some quadratic function of n)? Look at differences:\nFor n=7: f(7)=10. For n=8: f(8)=28. For n=9: f(9)=51.\nDifferences: 28-10=18, and 51-28=23; not constant differences.\n\nn=11: f(11)=105, difference from f(9) would be 105 - 51 =54 over gap of 2 steps. \nn=12: f(12)=223, which is a huge jump compared to 105. That seems odd.\nWait re-read: k12/12 = 2683/12 = 223.583... so maybe not.\n\nLet's recalc carefully:\nk8=224 means f(8) = 224/8 = 28 exactly.\nk11=1155 means f(11)=1155/11=105 exactly.\nFor k7, we have \"76/7 =10.86\" that is not an integer so maybe they are just checking divisibility? \nMaybe the intended pattern for some keys: sometimes the index divides the key evenly (like 8 and 11), other times it does not (like 7,9,12) but you can write k_n in the form f(n)*n + r. And then f(n) is approximately floor(k_n/n)? For n=7, floor(76/7)=10; for n=9, floor(467/9)=51; for n=12, floor(2683/12)=223.\nSo answer: \nf(7)=10, g(7)=6\nf(8)=28, g(8)=0\nf(9)=51, g(9)=8\nf(11)=105, g(11)=0\nf(12)=223, remainder 7.\n\nMaybe they want just f(n) values: \nFor n=2: unknown, for n=3: unknown, for n=4: unknown, for n=5: unknown (maybe can be deduced from k5 = k2*k3), but not given explicitly. Possibly the answer is to express that in general k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) where f(n)= floor(k_n/n) and g(n) is remainder.\n\nI must provide an explanation:\nWe have keys: \nk7=76 which can be written as 10\u00d77+6, so f(7)=10.\nk8=224 = 28\u00d78+0, so f(8)=28.\nk9=467 = 51\u00d79+8, so f(9)=51.\nk11=1155 =105\u00d711+0, so f(11)=105.\nAdditionally, k12=2683 can be expressed in two ways: directly as 223\u00d712+7 (since 223*12=2676 and remainder is 7) or using the relationship with k8: k12=k8\u00d712-5. Both representations show that sometimes f(n) takes the form of an integer multiple.\n\nI suspect the intended answer: \nf(2)=?; f(3)=?; f(4)=?; f(5)=? (if defined by product rule); f(6)=? etc. But we only have examples for indices 7,8,9,11,12.\n\nMaybe I can mention that the pattern indicates that when n divides k_n exactly, then g(n)=0 and f(n) equals k_n/n; when not divisible, then f(n) is the quotient of integer division of k_n by n, with remainder g(n).\n\nThus: \nk7=76 = 10\u00d77+6 so f(7)=10.\nk8=224=28\u00d78+0 so f(8)=28.\nk9=467=51\u00d79+8 so f(9)=51.\nk11=1155=105\u00d711+0 so f(11)=105.\nk12=2683=223\u00d712+7, so f(12)=223.\n\nI can also check if there is any pattern between the f-values and indices. Maybe f(n) roughly equals n^2 - something? For 8: 8^2=64, but f(8)=28 is less than that; for 11: 11^2=121, but f(11)=105 which is close but not equal; for 7: 7^2=49, but f(7)=10 is far off.\n\nMaybe there's a recurrence? \nGiven k5 = k2\u00d7k3, maybe f(5) can be computed if we know f(2), f(3). Let's denote k2 and k3. Perhaps they are defined earlier in the sequence. We don't have values for them though.\n\nI might answer: \"The pattern suggests that when writing k_n as k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), the function f takes on the following values for the provided keys:\nFor n=7, f(7)=10;\nfor n=8, f(8)=28;\nfor n=9, f(9)=51;\nfor n=11, f(11)=105;\nand for n=12, we note that k12 can also be written as k8\u00d712 -5 = 28\u00d712^2? That doesn't match. Let me recalc: k8=224; then k8\u00d712=2688; subtracting 5 gives 2683 which is k12.\nIf instead one writes it in the form f(12)*12 + remainder, we get f(12)=223 and remainder 7.\"\n\nI might also mention that sometimes g(n) is not zero (for n=7,9,12).\n\nPerhaps I'll answer: \nf(2), f(3), etc. But since they only want \"each key\", probably a list.\n\nMaybe the intended answer: \nk5 = k2*k3 implies k5 divided by 5 gives an integer if and only if k2*k3 is divisible by 5, which it might be given that k2 and k3 have factors relating to 5. Similarly for other keys, we get:\nf(7)=10,\nf(8)=28,\nf(9)=51,\nf(11)=105,\nand f(12) can be expressed as either 223 or in terms of f(8).\n\nThus my answer: \n\nFor k7=76, writing it as 10*7 + 6 gives f(7)=10.\nFor k8=224, we have 28*8 + 0 so f(8)=28.\nFor k9=467, we get 51*9 + 8 so f(9)=51.\nFor k11=1155, we have 105*11+0 so f(11)=105.\nFor k12=2683, notice that it can be written as 223*12+7, hence f(12)=223.\n\nI must check: 223*12 = 2676; plus 7 equals 2683.\n\nThus answer. \n\nI will now produce a final answer with explanation.</think>One acceptable way to \u201cexplain\u201d the pattern is to show that in many cases the key k\u2099 can be written in the form\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = f(n)\u00b7n + g(n)\n\nwhere sometimes g(n) happens to be zero (so n divides k\u2099 exactly) and sometimes not. For example, from the work we have:\n\n\u2022\u2003For n = 7 we are given k\u2087 = 76. Dividing by 7 gives\n\u2003\u200376 = 10\u00d77 + 6,\nso one may take f(7) = 10 (with a \u201cremainder\u201d g(7) = 6).\n\n\u2022\u2003For n = 8 we have k\u2088 = 224, and since\n\u2003\u2003224 = 28\u00d78 + 0,\nwe set f(8) = 28.\n\n\u2022\u2003For n = 9 we are told k\u2089 = 467. Writing it as a product plus remainder we get\n\u2003\u2003467 = 51\u00d79 + 8,\nso one may take f(9) = 51.\n\n\u2022\u2003For n = 11 the key is k\u2081\u2081 = 1155 and indeed\n\u2003\u20031155 = 105\u00d711 + 0,\nso here f(11) = 105.\n\n\u2022\u2003Finally, for n = 12 we have k\u2081\u2082 = 2683. (It also happens that one may show k\u2081\u2082 can be written as k\u2088\u00d712 \u2013 5; since k\u2088 = 224 this gives 224\u00d712 \u2013 5 = 2688 \u2013 5 = 2683.) If we write k\u2081\u2082 in the form f(12)\u00b712 + g(12) we find\n\u2003\u20032683 = 223\u00d712 + 7,\nso we may take f(12) = 223.\n\nAny answer that shows these same values is correct. (Note that sometimes one has a nonzero remainder, as for n = 7, 9 and 12; in other cases the key is exactly divisible by its index\u2014as with n = 8 and 11.)",
