  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence where each term is a linear combination of the two previous terms, like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}. They also mentioned trying a version with a constant term, like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c. The given values are k7 = 76 and k8 = 224, and we need to see if there are integers a and b (and maybe c) that satisfy these equations. \n\nFirst, let me focus on the main question without the constant. The problem gives me two equations based on k7 and k8:\n\n1. 76 = 49a + 21b\n2. 224 = 76a + 49b\n\nHmm, so I need to solve this system of equations for a and b. Let me write them down again:\n\nEquation 1: 49a + 21b = 76  \nEquation 2: 76a + 49b = 224\n\nI can try to solve this using substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination because the coefficients are a bit messy. Maybe multiply the first equation by 49 and the second equation by 21 to eliminate b? Let's see:\n\nMultiply Equation 1 by 49:  \n49*(49a) + 49*(21b) = 49*76  \nWhich is: 2401a + 1029b = 3724\n\nMultiply Equation 2 by 21:  \n21*(76a) + 21*(49b) = 21*224  \nWhich is: 1596a + 1029b = 4704\n\nNow subtract the first new equation from the second new equation to eliminate b:\n\n(1596a + 1029b) - (2401a + 1029b) = 4704 - 3724  \n1596a - 2401a = 980  \n-805a = 980  \nSo a = 980 / (-805)  \nHmm, simplifying that fraction. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 5:  \n980 \u00f75 = 196, 805 \u00f75 = 161  \nSo a = -196/161. Wait, that's still a fraction. Maybe simplify further? 196 and 161 have a common factor? Let's see, 161 is 23*7, 196 is 28*7. So 7 is a common factor.  \nDivide numerator and denominator by 7:  \n-196/161 = -28/23. So a is -28/23.\n\nHmm, that's not an integer. The problem said \"Can you find integer a, b?\" So if a is a fraction, then maybe there are no integer solutions? But let me check my calculations again because fractions might be okay if we didn't require integers, but the problem specifically asks for integer a and b.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me verify the steps again.\n\nStarting with:\n\nEquation 1: 49a +21b =76  \nEquation 2:76a +49b =224\n\nI wanted to eliminate b by multiplying Equation1 by 49 and Equation2 by 21. Let me recalculate:\n\nFirst equation multiplied by 49:  \n49*(49a) = 49^2 a = 2401a  \n49*(21b) = 49*21b = 1029b  \n49*76 = 3724. That seems right.\n\nSecond equation multiplied by 21:  \n21*(76a) = 21*76a. Let's compute 21*76: 20*76=1520, 1*76=76, so total 1596. So 1596a  \n21*49b = 1029b  \n21*224 = 21*(200 +24) = 4200 + 504 = 4704. That's correct.\n\nSubtracting the first multiplied equation from the second:  \n1596a + 1029b - (2401a +1029b) =4704 -3724  \nSo (1596a -2401a) + (1029b -1029b) = 980  \n-805a =980  \nThus a= -980/805. Let me compute that again: 980 divided by 805. Let's see, 805*1 =805, subtract that from 980: 175 left. So 980/805 = (805 +175)/805 =1 + 175/805. Hmm, but with the negative sign, it's - (1 + 175/805). Not integer.\n\nHmm, maybe I should try another method? Let me try substitution instead.\n\nFrom Equation1: 49a +21b =76. Let's solve for a:\n\n49a =76 -21b  \na = (76 -21b)/49\n\nNow plug this into Equation2:\n\n76a +49b =224  \n76*( (76 -21b)/49 ) +49b =224\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst term:76*(76 -21b)/49  \nLet me compute 76/49 first. That's 76 divided by 49. Hmm, maybe keep it as fractions.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n[76*(76 -21b) ] /49 +49b =224\n\nMultiply all terms by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n76*(76 -21b) + 49*49b =224*49\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nFirst term:76*76 -76*21b  \n76*76 is 5776, 76*21 is 1596, so first term is 5776 -1596b  \nSecond term:49*49b =2401b  \nThird term:224*49. Let's compute that: 224*50 =11200, minus 224 gives 11200-224=10976.\n\nSo putting together:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b =10976\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-1596b +2401b) =805b  \nSo equation becomes: 5776 +805b =10976  \nSubtract 5776: 805b =10976 -5776  \nCalculate 10976 -5776: that's 5200.  \nWait 10976 -5776: 10976 -5000=5976, then -776 gives 5976-776=5200. So 805b=5200  \nThus b=5200/805. Let me simplify that fraction.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 5200/5=1040, 805/5=161  \nSo b=1040/161. Hmm, 1040 divided by 161. Let me see if they have common factors. 161 is 7*23, 1040 divided by 7? 7*148=1036, so 1040-1036=4. Not divisible by7. Divided by23? 23*45=1035, 1040-1035=5. So no common factors. So b is 1040/161 \u22486.46. Not integer.\n\nHmm, so neither a nor b are integers here. That suggests that there are no integer solutions for a and b in the recurrence relation k_n =a k_{n-1} +b k_{n-2}. But maybe I made a mistake in the equations? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"for k7 =76: 76 =a\u00d749 +b\u00d721\" and \"for k8=224: 224 =a\u00d776 +b\u00d749\". So assuming that the previous terms are k6=21 and k5=49? Wait hold on, perhaps I need to confirm the order here. Wait, if k7 is 76, then k6 would be the term before it, so if the recurrence is k_n =a k_{n-1} +b k_{n-2}, then:\n\nk7 = a*k6 + b*k5  \nk8 =a*k7 +b*k6\n\nBut in the problem, they wrote:\n\nFor k7 =76: 76 = a\u00d749 +b\u00d721  \nWait, so they substituted k6=49 and k5=21?\n\nSimilarly for k8: 224= a\u00d776 +b\u00d749, so k7=76 and k6=49. \n\nTherefore, the prior terms are k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224. \n\nWait, but if that's the case, then the user is correct in setting up the equations. So the equations are set up properly, but solving them gives fractional a and b, so no integer solutions. \n\nHmm, so maybe the answer is that there are no integer a and b. But the problem also says \"Also try: k_n =a\u00d7k_{n-1} +b\u00d7k_{n-2}+c\" so maybe with a constant term, there could be integer solutions?\n\nLet me try that. So now we need to see if there are integers a, b, c such that:\n\nFor k7=76: 76 = a*k6 + b*k5 +c =a*49 +b*21 +c  \nFor k8=224:224= a*k7 +b*k6 +c =a*76 +b*49 +c\n\nSo now we have two equations with three variables, so we need another equation? Wait, but we don't have more terms given. Wait, the problem is only providing k7 and k8. Maybe we can assume that the recurrence starts earlier? Hmm, but without more data points, maybe we can set c to be a constant and see if possible?\n\nAlternatively, since we have two equations and three unknowns, maybe we can set one variable as a parameter, but the problem is asking if such integers a, b, c exist. Let me see.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\n1) 49a +21b +c =76  \n2)76a +49b +c =224\n\nLet me subtract equation1 from equation2 to eliminate c:\n\n(76a +49b +c) - (49a +21b +c) =224 -76  \n76a -49a +49b -21b +c -c =148  \n27a +28b =148\n\nSo now, we have 27a +28b =148. Let's see if this equation has integer solutions for a and b.\n\nWe can write this as 27a =148 -28b. So 27 divides (148 -28b). Let me see if there are integers a and b that satisfy this.\n\nAlternatively, solving for a:\n\na = (148 -28b)/27\n\nWe need (148 -28b) divisible by 27. Let me see for integer b such that 148 -28b \u22610 mod27\n\nLet me compute modulo27:\n\n148 mod27: 27*5=135, 148-135=13 \u2192 148\u226113 mod27  \n28 mod27\u22611 mod27. So 28b mod27\u2261b mod27  \nThus, 148 -28b \u226113 -b mod27 \u22610 mod27  \nSo 13 -b \u22610 mod27 \u2192 -b \u2261-13 mod27 \u2192 b\u226113 mod27  \nTherefore, b=13 +27k for some integer k.\n\nSo possible values of b are 13, 13-27= -14, 13+27=40, etc. Let me test these to see if a becomes integer.\n\nLet me try b=13:\n\nThen a=(148 -28*13)/27  \n28*13=364  \n148-364= -216  \na= -216/27= -8. So a= -8. That works! So a=-8 and b=13. Then c can be found from equation1:\n\nFrom equation1:49*(-8) +21*(13) +c=76  \nCompute 49*(-8)= -392  \n21*13=273  \nSo -392 +273 +c=76 \u2192 (-119) +c=76 \u2192 c=76+119=195\n\nSo c=195. Let me check equation2 to confirm:\n\n76*(-8) +49*(13)+195  \n76*(-8)= -608  \n49*13=637  \n-608 +637 =29  \n29 +195=224. Perfect, that matches.\n\nSo with a=-8, b=13, c=195, the equations are satisfied. \n\nBut the problem mentions \"if there's a recurrence, we can predict k15, k16!\" So perhaps this is a valid linear recurrence with constant term. But the question was first about the Fibonacci-like without constant. Since the first part (without c) didn't have integer solutions, but with c there is. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem is expecting us to consider both possibilities. The user says \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} +b\u00d7k_{n-2} +c\". So the main question was whether there exists a and b (without c). Since that didn't work, but with c it does. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that there are no integer a and b for the Fibonacci-like recurrence without a constant term, but there is a solution with a constant term: a=-8, b=13, c=195. \n\nHowever, the problem might be expecting only the first part? Let me check again the initial problem statement:\n\n\"Does the sequence follow a recurrence like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\n\nTEST: Can we find a, b such that k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\n\nFor k7 = 76:\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n224 = 76a + 49b\n\nSolve system:\nFrom first: 76 = 49a + 21b\nFrom second: 224 = 76a + 49b\n\nCan you find integer a, b?\n\nAlso try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} +b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c\"\n\nThe main question is whether there exists such a and b (without c). Since we found that with the constant term it works, but without, it doesn't. Therefore, the answer is no for the Fibonacci-like recurrence (without constant) but yes with a constant.\n\nHowever, maybe the problem is expecting to consider that even without the constant, but allowing non-integer coefficients? But the question specifically says \"Can you find integer a, b?\" so the answer would be no for the first part, yes for the second part with c.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the sequence does not follow the Fibonacci-like recurrence with integer a and b, but does follow a linear recurrence with a constant term. \n\nBut the problem might be just asking the first part? Let me see the exact wording:\n\n\"Does the sequence follow a recurrence like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\n\nTEST: Can we find a, b such that k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7n-2}?\n\n[...]\n\nCan you find integer a, b?\"\n\nSo the answer to the first question is no, but the second part with the constant term is yes. Since the user also says \"Also try: ... with c\", so the problem is expecting to check both? Since the user is asking to write the answer in boxed, maybe the first part is the main question, so the answer is \"No\", but since the instructions say \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", perhaps we need to see if the problem wants the existence or the coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated? Let me recheck the equations for a and b without c.\n\nThe two equations are:\n\n49a +21b =76  \n76a +49b =224\n\nLet me try to solve them again. Let me write them as:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b =76  \nEquation2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me use elimination. Multiply equation1 by 49 and equation2 by21 to eliminate b:\n\nEquation1*49: 49*49a +49*21b =76*49  \nEquation2*21: 76*21a +49*21b =224*21  \n\nSubtract equation1*49 - equation2*21:\n\n(49*49a -76*21a) + (49*21b -49*21b)=76*49 -224*21\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\nFor a terms:\n\n49*49a -76*21a = (49\u00b2 -76*21)a. Let me compute 49\u00b2=2401, 76*21=1596. So 2401 -1596=805. So 805a\n\nFor the constants:76*49 -224*21. 76*49=3724, 224*21=4704. 3724-4704= -980\n\nThus 805a = -980 \u2192 a= -980 /805. Simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: -196 /161. Hmm, 196 is 14\u00b2, 161=23*7. Doesn't simplify further. So a= -196/161 \u2248-1.217.\n\nThen plugging back into equation1:49*(-196/161) +21b=76\n\nCompute 49*(-196)/161: note that 49/161= 7/23 (since 161=23*7). So 7/23 * (-196)= 7*(-196)/23= -1372/23\n\nThus equation1 becomes: -1372/23 +21b =76  \n21b=76 +1372/23  \nConvert 76 to 76*23/23=1748/23  \nThus 21b=(1748+1372)/23=3120/23  \nThus b= (3120/23)/21= 3120/(23*21)=3120/483. Simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 1040/161 \u22486.46. Which matches previous result. \n\nSo fractional, so no integer solutions. \n\nThus the answer is that with the constant term, there is a solution (a=-8,b=13,c=195), but without constant, there isn't. Since the question first asks about the Fibonacci-like (without c), the answer is no. But since the user also mentions to try with c, maybe they want us to state that with c it works, so the answer is yes with c? But the question is phrased as first part, then also try. Maybe the problem expects the first part's answer as boxed no, but since the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", perhaps the question is to find a,b,c? The exact problem is a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the context of a competition where the answer is whether the recurrence exists with integer coefficients, so the answer is no, but with a constant, but since the first part is the question, the answer is \"No\", but in boxed form, maybe \\boxed{\\text{No}} but instructions say \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". Alternatively, maybe the problem is from an exam where you have to write the values of a,b if possible, but since they are not integers, but with c, there are, so the problem might expect the answer for the constant term? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the terms, maybe the prior terms are different. Wait, the problem says \"for k7=76: 76=a\u00d749 +b\u00d721\". So k6 is 49, k5 is21. So prior terms are k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224. Let me check if with the found coefficients a=-8, b=13, c=195, does the previous term work? Let's see, for example, to compute k6: If the recurrence is k_n = -8k_{n-1} +13k_{n-2} +195,\n\nThen for k7: -8*k6 +13*k5 +195 = -8*49 +13*21 +195= -392 +273 +195= ( -392 +273)= -119 +195=76 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k8: -8*76 +13*49 +195= -608 +637 +195= ( -608 +637)=29 +195=224 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhat about k6? Let's see, if we go back, perhaps k4 is needed? The recurrence would require k4 to compute k5. But since we don't have k4, but if the recurrence holds for all n\u2265 some number, then perhaps starting from k5 onwards. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the recurrence starts at n\u22657, but then k5 and k6 are initial terms. Alternatively, maybe it's consistent with prior terms?\n\nSuppose we assume the recurrence holds for all terms, then to compute k5: \n\nk5= -8*k4 +13*k3 +195. But without knowing k4 and k3, we can't check. But maybe the problem is only concerned with the given terms, so the existence of such a recurrence that works for k7 and k8 is sufficient. \n\nTherefore, the problem's first question (without c) has no solution, but with c it does. Since the user mentions \"Also try...\" maybe the intended answer is that with the constant term, there is a solution, so the coefficients are a=-8, b=13, c=195, but the question is whether the sequence follows a recurrence like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} +b\u00d7k_{n-2}, so the answer is no, but with c yes. However, since the problem asks specifically for the first part (Fibonacci-like), the answer is no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in another way: perhaps the user made an error in the setup? For instance, if k6 is 21 and k5 is something else? But the equations were given by the user as 49 and 21 for k6 and k5. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from a source where the answer is the constants a,b,c, so the user expects to write those boxed. Since the question was \"Can you find integer a, b?\" the answer is no, but with c yes. But the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". Maybe the problem expects us to write that there are no integers a and b, so boxed \"No\". But instructions might prefer the coefficients if they exist. Since with c they exist, but the question was first without c, maybe the answer is that there are no such integers a and b, so boxed \"No\".\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo and the terms are different, but given the information provided, the answer is that without c, no solution exists, with c, there is. Since the first part is the main question, the answer is no. \n\nBut the user might have expected the solver to present the coefficients with c, so perhaps the problem is to find a,b,c? Since it's possible, then the answer would be those numbers. The problem says \"Can you find integer a,b...\", so the answer is no for that, but with c you can, so perhaps the problem wants the triplet (a,b,c). Since the problem is a bit ambiguous, but given the way it's presented, maybe the boxed answer is \"No\", but I need to check the exact question again.\n\nThe exact question presented is: \"Does the sequence follow a recurrence like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}? TEST: Can we find a, b such that k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}? [...] Can you find integer a, b?\"\n\nThus, the answer is no, so boxed \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the values of a and b even if they are fractions? But the question specifies \"integer a, b\". So since they are not integers, the answer is No. \n\nThus, the final answer is \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in solving? Let me see another approach. Suppose there are integers a and b such that:\n\nFor n=7: 76 = a*49 + b*21  \nFor n=8: 224 = a*76 + b*49\n\nLet me write equations:\n\n1) 49a +21b =76  \n2)76a +49b=224\n\nLet me try to solve for a and b.\n\nFrom equation1: 49a =76 -21b \u21d2 a=(76-21b)/49\n\nPlug into equation2:\n\n76*(76-21b)/49 +49b=224  \nMultiply all terms by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n76*(76 -21b) +49\u00b2 b =224*49  \nCompute each term:\n\n76*76 = 5776  \n76*(-21b)= -1596b  \n49\u00b2b=2401b  \n224*49=224*50 -224=11200-224=10976\n\nThus:\n\n5776 -1596b +2401b =10976  \nCombine like terms:\n\n(2401b -1596b)=805b  \nSo 5776 +805b =10976  \n805b=10976-5776=5200  \nThus b=5200/805. Simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 1040/161. Which is the same as before, so 1040 divided by 161 is not integer. Hence, no integer solution. So indeed no solution for integers a and b. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n\nBut the user also mentions \"Also try [...] with c\". Maybe the problem is from somewhere where the answer is the triplet a=-8, b=13, c=195. But the question specifically asks first for a and b without c. Since the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", perhaps they expect the answer for the first part (no) so boxed No, but maybe in the problem's context, they want the coefficients with c. Since the problem says \"Can you find integer a,b...\", the answer is no, but with c you can, but since the question is about the recurrence without c, the answer is No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants the values of a and b with c, but the problem didn't ask for that. Since the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", and given the problem's phrasing, I think the answer is \\boxed{\\text{No}}.\n</think>\n\nThe problem asks whether the sequence follows a recurrence relation of the form \\( k_n = a \\times k_{n-1} + b \\times k_{n-2} \\) with integer coefficients \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). \n\nGiven the equations:\n1. \\( 49a + 21b = 76 \\)\n2. \\( 76a + 49b = 224 \\)\n\nWe solved these equations and found that there are no integer solutions for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). The solutions for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are fractional, which means such integer coefficients do not exist for the given recurrence relation without a constant term.\n\nHowever, when considering a recurrence relation with a constant term \\( c \\), we found that \\( a = -8 \\), \\( b = 13 \\), and \\( c = 195 \\) satisfy the equations. But since the problem specifically asks for the recurrence without a constant term, the answer remains that there are no such integer coefficients \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\text{No}}\\).",
