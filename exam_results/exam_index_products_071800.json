The pattern is \"Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula\", and then check if k_n can be expressed as f(n)*n + g(n) for some functions f(n) and g(n). And they show that for n=8, k8 = 28\u00d78; i.e., 224 = 28*8. For n=11, k11 = 105 \u00d7 11; 1155=105*11.\n\nWe are asked: \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" So we have a list of keys? Possibly the keys with indices: maybe from 2 to something, or maybe more keys exist in a pattern. But the problem only gives explicit formulas for k2,k3? Actually check: The statement is: OBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\nSo that indicates maybe there's an interesting relationship when sum of indices equals key index? Because 2+3=5. That is observed for k5.\n\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nWait: It says \"observed: ... k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5\" But note that the sum of indices here would be 8? Actually, let's check: if we assume a pattern like: maybe for key with index n, it is sometimes equal to something times (n) plus or minus something. And the text \"CHECK:\" shows several values for keys: k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7=10.86 (not clean), k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8=28, k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 ~51.89, k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u21921155/11=105, k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u21922683/12=223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683.\n\nSo the keys in question: There are keys for n=2? They mention k2 and k3 (for product rule) but don't show their actual values?\nWe need to deduce pattern.\n\nGiven that f(n) * n + g(n) = k_n. For some cases, we see clean divisions:\nFor k8, 224/8 = 28 exactly so f(8)=28 and then g(8)=0.\nFor k11, 1155/11 = 105 exactly so f(11)=105 and then presumably g(11)=0.\n\nMaybe there's a pattern: maybe keys are defined as the product of two other keys plus some constant times n? Not sure.\n\nThe observed formulas:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3. This might be seen as k2 * k3 equals (f(2)*2 + g(2))*(f(3)*3 + g(3)) but then expressed as f(5)*5+g(5)? That doesn't look like it.\n\nWait, maybe the keys are known numbers? Let's see: They mention \"k8 = 28\u00d78\" so k8=224. k11=105*11=1155. k12=2683? And check given formula: k12= k8 \u00d7 12 -5 so that equals 224 *12 -5 = 2688-5=2683. So that's consistent.\n\nAlso they mention k7 is computed by dividing 76 by 7 and get a non integer result, k9 gives 467/9 not an integer, k5? They don't give explicit value for k5? They say \"k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3\" but no numerical values.\nMaybe we need to list f(n) for keys which are computed as f(n)*n + g(n) with integer quotient. So far, observed keys that yield an integer result when divided by n: For n=8 and n=11, the division gives integer results.\n\nWhat is k2? Not provided explicitly. But maybe we can deduce from \"k5 = k2 * k3\". Possibly there's a recurrence relation? The problem statement looks like it might be related to keys in a puzzle that are given by some pattern, perhaps something known as \"Index Product Pattern Analysis\"? Perhaps these keys correspond to the series of numbers generated by some recurrence.\n\nMaybe the full sequence is: k1=... what?\n\nLet\u2019s re-read the user's message:\n\nINDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nOBSERVED:\n- k5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (indices 2,3 \u2192 product 5\u00d7? no)\n- k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (index 12 appears in formula!)\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\n\nCHECK:\n1. k7 = ? \u00d7 7 + ? \u2192 76/7 = 10.86 (not clean)\n2. k8 = ? \u00d7 8 + ? \u2192 224/8 = 28 = k8/8 \u2713 (28 is integer!)\n3. k9 = ? \u00d7 9 + ? \u2192 467/9 = 51.89 (not clean)\n4. k11 = ? \u00d7 11 + ? \u2192 1155/11 = 105 (integer!)\n5. k12 = ? \u00d7 12 + ? \u2192 2683/12 = 223.58... but k8\u00d712-5=2683\n\nSo k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\n\nIs there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)?\n\nCalculate f(n) for each key.\n\nIt appears the keys are of the form: k2, k3, k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12,...\n\nWe have two formulas:\n- k5 = k2 * k3. Possibly that means that if you multiply key at index 2 and key at index 3 (which are presumably f(2)*2+g(2) and f(3)*3+g(3)), their product equals the value of key with index sum=2+3? Because 5 is equal to sum of indices? Similarly, for k12 = k8 * 12 - 5, notice that 8 + ? Not sure.\n\nMaybe there's a connection: The sum of indices in the first formula is 2+3=5; second one: 8*12-5 gives index 12. But then why subtract 5?\n\nIt says \"sometimes the INDEX itself appears in the formula.\" For k8, we see that it divides evenly by 8 giving f(8)=28. For k11, it's 105.\n\nMaybe there is a pattern: Possibly f(n) = (k_n / n) when k_n/n is integer, and g(n) might be 0 in those cases. But then for keys where it doesn't divide evenly, maybe the formula includes an additional term: k_n = f(n)*n + something.\n\nWait let me re-read \"CHECK:\" lines:\n\n1. For k7, they try to express it as (? \u00d7 7 + ?). They compute 76/7 = 10.86 which is not integer.\n2. For k8, they get 224/8=28 (so f(8)=28, g(8) appears to be 0).\n3. For k9, 467/9=51.89, so that doesn't work cleanly as an integer multiple of 9; maybe it's 52 - something? Actually, if we try rounding: 9*52 =468, so maybe f(9)=52 and then subtract 1 gives 468-1 =467. So maybe k9= 52\u00d79 - 1.\n4. For k11, they get exactly 1155/11=105, so f(11)=105, g(11)=0.\n5. For k12, 2683/12 is not integer but then note that 224*12-5 gives 2683, which implies k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5. And since k8 =28\u00d78=224, then k12 becomes 28\u00d78\u00d712 -5 = (28\u00d796)-5=2688-5=2683.\n\nSo the pattern might be: sometimes k_n has a factor of n when f(n) is integer. For example, k8 and k11 are pure multiples of their index; but for others like k7 and k9, there's an extra term that adjusts it. So maybe f(n) for each key is defined by taking the nearest integer to (k_n)/n such that k_n = f(n)* n + g(n). And then calculate f(2), f(3), etc.\n\nWe have explicit keys: k5, k7, k8, k9, k11, k12. But what are their numeric values? They provided some: \nk7=76, k8=224, k9=467, k11=1155, k12=2683. Also given: k5 is equal to k2 \u00d7 k3, but we don't know the actual numbers for k2 and k3.\n\nMaybe there's an underlying sequence. Possibly these keys come from a known puzzle \"Index Product\" or something? The observed pattern might be similar to that of some sequences like Ulam spiral?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects: f(n)= (k_n - g(n))/n. But we don't know g(n) explicitly.\n\nWait let's parse: They are trying to see if k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) holds for each key n, and then ask \"Calculate f(n) for each key.\" Possibly the answer is a list of pairs (n, f(n)) for the keys we have. We have for:\n- k7: 76 divided by 7 gives quotient = 10 remainder 6, so f(7)=10? But that would be if we force integer division with floor maybe?\n- k8: exactly 28.\n- k9: 467/9=51 remainder 8, so maybe f(9)=52? Because 52*9=468, which is 1 more than 467. So f(9)=52 if we round up to nearest integer that gives a multiple of 9?\n- k11: exactly 105.\n- k12: not an exact division; however, they show it equals 2683 = 28\u00d712 -5? But wait, check: k8=224, and then k8\u00d712 -5= 2688-5=2683. So maybe in the case of k12, f(12) would be what integer times 12 plus something? Let's try to express 2683 as a multiple of 12 plus remainder: 2683 /12 =223 remainder (2683-223*12). 223*12=2676, remainder 7. So it could also be expressed as 223\u00d712 +7; so maybe f(12)=223 and g(12)=7? But the check says \"k8\u00d712 -5\" which is 224*12 - 5 =2683, but then that doesn't match the form k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) if we choose f(n)= ? Wait let's recalc: If we assume k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), and for n=8, we got f(8)=28 and g(8)=0. For n=11, f(11)=105, g(11)=0. For n=12, if we want to represent 2683 in that form, then f(12) must be such that 12 divides 2683 minus some constant. We can find integer quotient: floor division of 2683/12 is 223 remainder 7, so one representation is k_12 = 223\u00d712 +7, with g(12)=7. But the check \"k8\u00d712 -5\" suggests that maybe they intended to use f(8) and then subtract something. Possibly the pattern is not uniform.\n\nI wonder if the question implies: We are trying to determine a function f(n) such that k_n = n*f(n)+g(n). And for some keys, it divides evenly; for others, there's an extra offset which might be coming from previous keys.\n\nLet me try to re-read user message. They mention \"INDEX PRODUCT PATTERN ANALYSIS\". Possibly this is about the \"Key Pattern\" in some cryptographic or puzzle challenge where each key k_n equals a product of previous keys plus something. And then the hypothesis: sometimes the index itself appears in the formula, i.e., n might be a factor.\n\nWe have examples:\nk5 = k2 \u00d7 k3 (here, indices 2 and 3 add up to 5 maybe)\nk12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5 (here, index 12 is multiplied by k8 then adjusted)\n\nThen the checks: they try to see if you can write keys in the form f(n)*n + g(n). For some keys it works nicely. They list for n=7, k7=76, so 76/7 = 10.86 (not an integer). For n=8, 224/8=28 exactly, so f(8)=28. For n=9, 467/9=51.89, not integer; for n=11, 1155/11=105, integer; and for n=12, 2683/12 is not an integer but note that it equals k8\u00d712-5.\n\nSo then they state: \"So k8 = 28\u00d78 and k11 = 105\u00d711\".\n\nThen question: \"Is there a pattern where k_n = f(n) \u00d7 n + g(n)? Calculate f(n) for each key.\"\n\nMaybe the intended answer is: f(2)=? (if we can compute from other information), f(3)=?, etc. But we don't have explicit values for some keys.\n\nPerhaps there's a known sequence? Let me try to guess: maybe these keys correspond to something like:\nk1 = ?\nk2 = ? \nk3 = ?\nMaybe the recurrence relation is something like k_n = (sum of previous two keys) * n or something?\n\nLet\u2019s check: For n=5, they observed that k5 equals product of k2 and k3. That suggests maybe for some indices, k_n equals product of two earlier keys.\n\nFor n=12, they observed k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5. So if we assume pattern \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\", then for n=12, one possibility is that g(12) might come from a previous key value, like minus 5. And note that 5 equals k2 maybe? Because earlier they had product of indices: 2 and 3 sum to 5.\nMaybe there's a relation where g(n) = something like - (k_{n-7}) for n=12 if n-7 =5? That is too contrived.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the keys are defined by: \nFor prime indices n, k_n = (sum of digits or product of digits?) times n?\nNo.\n\nLet's re-read the \"Check\" parts carefully:\n\nk7 = 76. If we try to express 76 as f(7)*7 + g(7), then f(7) must be an integer and remainder is less than 7 in absolute value if that\u2019s how they are defined? Possibly g(n) could be any number, not necessarily small.\n\nFor k8: 224/8 =28 exactly. So f(8)=28.\nFor k9: 467 divided by 9 equals 51 remainder 8 because 9*52=468 which is 1 too many. But 51*9 =459 and remainder 8, but 8 is not less than 9? Actually remainder in division algorithm can be anything if we allow negative g(n). For standard Euclidean division, the remainder should satisfy 0 <= r < divisor. So maybe they want to choose f(9) such that k9 = f(9)*9 + r with 0<=r<9. Let's check possible choices: 467/9=51 remainder 8 (because 9*51=459, plus 8=467). That fits the condition 0 <= r < 9 if we take f(9)=51 and g(9)=8, but then f(7) would be 76/7 is not an integer. The nearest multiples: 11*7=77 (remainder -1) or 10*7=70 (remainder 6). Which one fits the remainder condition? Standard division algorithm requires remainder to be nonnegative and less than divisor. For n=7, dividing 76 by 7 gives quotient 10 and remainder 6 because 10*7 =70, remainder 6; 6 is between 0 and 6. So for k7, we get f(7)=10 and g(7)=6.\nFor k8: 224/8=28 exactly, so f(8)=28 and g(8)=0.\nFor k9: 467 divided by 9 gives quotient 51 remainder 8 because 51*9=459, remainder=8; but 8 is less than 9? Yes, that's valid if we take floor division. But then check: 10 *7 +6 =70+6=76 works. For k11: 1155/11 gives quotient 105 exactly and remainder 0.\nFor k12: 2683 divided by 12: quotient would be 223 remainder 7 because 223*12=2676, remainder=7; that fits the condition 0<=7<12 if we use floor division. But they also observed that it equals k8\u00d712 -5 =224*12-5=2688-5=2683, which is consistent with f(12)=224? That would be weird because then 224*12 would be 2688, but then subtract 5 gives 2683. So maybe the representation they want is not the division algorithm remainder, but rather a decomposition where sometimes the multiplier for n in k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) comes from one of the previous keys.\n\nLet's check: For k11, they wrote \"k11 = 105\u00d711\". For k8, they have that too. And then they also mention k12 can be written as \"224\u00d712 -5\" but that doesn't match the pattern f(12)*12 + g(12) because if we try to put it in the form f(n)*n + g(n), then for n=12, you might set f(12)=224 and g(12)=-5. That is a valid representation if there's no restriction on g(n). So maybe that's what they want.\n\nMaybe the pattern: sometimes g(n)=0, sometimes it equals a previous key's index offset (like -5 for n=12, which might be k2 or something).\n\nLet's try to deduce more:\nWe have:\nk7 = ? = 76.\nk8 = 224.\nk9 = 467.\nk11 = 1155.\nk12 = 2683.\n\nNow if we assume k_n = f(n)*n + g(n), then for n=7: 76/7 is not integer, so f(7) = floor(76/7)=10 and remainder g(7)=6 (if using division algorithm).\nFor n=8: exactly, f(8)=224/8=28.\nFor n=9: floor(467/9)=51, remainder 467 - 51*9 =467-459=8, so f(9)=51, g(9)=8.\nFor n=11: 1155/11=105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\nFor n=12: as computed, f(12)=223 if we take floor division, with remainder 7; but also the representation \"224\u00d712 -5\" gives f(12)=224 and g(12)=-5.\n\nWhich one is intended? The text \"CHECK:\" lists:\n1. k7 = ? -> they compute 76/7=10.86 (so not integer)\n2. k8: 224/8=28 exactly, so that's f(8)=28.\n3. k9: 467/9=51.89 (so not integer)\n4. k11: 1155/11 =105 exactly, so f(11)=105.\n5. k12: 2683/12 is 223.58... but then they note that \"k8\u00d712 -5\" equals 2683. So it seems the intended representation for k12 is using k8 (which we know is 28\u00d78) and then multiplying by 12 and subtracting 5, which gives 224*12-5=2683. That suggests that maybe f(12)=k8=224, not 223.\n\nSo maybe the rule \"k_n = f(n)*n + g(n)\" should be interpreted as: sometimes f(n) is given by another key's value, such as k8 appears in the representation for k12. So perhaps there is a recurrence that connects keys of different indices.\n\nMaybe we have to list:\nFor n=2, maybe f(2)=? and k2 might equal something like 13 (for instance). For n=3, maybe f(3) equals ? such that k5 = k2*k3. But then what is f(5)? It would be from the formula k5= f(5)*5 + g(5) if it can be expressed in that form.\nGiven we have 76 for k7 and 224 for k8, maybe these keys come from a known sequence like \"A073108\" or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer expected is simply: \nf(2)=? (not provided)\nf(3)=?\nf(5) = ? \nf(7)=10,\nf(8)=28,\nf(9)=51,\nf(11)=105,\nf(12)=224.\n\nBut then what about k5? We know k5 = k2*k3. If we assume that k2 and k3 are in the form f(2)*2 + g(2) and f(3)*3+g(3), maybe their product equals something like (something)*5 + something. But without values for k2, k3, it's hard.\n\nMaybe I can try to guess: if k8 = 28*8, then possibly f(8)=28. And k11=105 so f(11)=105. And k12 represented as 224\u00d712 -5 suggests that maybe f(12) is taken from a previous key (k8 was 28, but here 224 appears which is k8*8). So perhaps the rule is: sometimes f(n) equals k_(n-...)? \n\nLet's try to see pattern: For n=7, if we express it as \"something * 7 + something\", what would that something be? Possibly using previous keys. But we only have one candidate for a clean multiple, which is when n divides k_n exactly.\n\nI suspect the intended answer is simply: f(2)=?, f(3)=?, f(5)=?, f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, f(12)=224. And then note that for some keys, k_n = n * f(n) exactly, and for others there is an offset.\n\nLet me try to see if the numbers 76, 224, 467, 1155, 2683 have any relation? \n- 76: prime factors are 2^2 *19. \n- 224= 28*8 = 7*32.\n- 467 is prime? 467 mod small primes: not divisible by 7 because 7*66=462, remainder 5; it's probably prime. \n- 1155= 3*5*7*11? Actually 1155 factors as 3 * 5 * 7 * 11.\n- 2683 factors? 2683 mod 7 = 7*383.285... not sure.\n\nMaybe these are terms from a known sequence: \n76, 224, 467, 1155, 2683,...\n\nI recall a puzzle called \"The Locksmith's Problem\" or something where keys are numbers that follow such patterns. Alternatively, maybe it's related to a famous riddle \"The Three Keys\" but not sure.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question might be: Given a set of keys represented by numbers with a structure k_n = f(n)*n + g(n) and some examples provided (k7=76, etc.), determine what f(2), f(3), ... are. Possibly the answer expected is:\n\nFor key 7: Write 76 as 10*7+6 so f(7)=10.\nFor key 8: 224 = 28*8 + 0, so f(8) = 28.\nFor key 9: 467 = 52*9 -1? Let's check: 52*9=468, 468-1=467, so that would give f(9)=52 and g(9)=-1. But wait, if we try quotient division normally, 47*9=423, remainder 44; not consistent. Possibly they use the nearest integer such that the product is closest to k_n? For 76 divided by 7 gives 10.857, so maybe f(7)=11 would give 77 which is off by 1. For 467/9 =51.888..., so maybe f(9)=52 giving 468, off by -1. And for 2683/12=223.5833, rounding up gives 224*12=2688, off by -5, but that matches the given representation \"k8\u00d712 -5\" which uses k8 = 28? Wait, if we use f(12)=224 then that doesn't match because 224 is not equal to k8. Let me recalc: They said k12 can be written as \"k8\u00d712 -5\", and since k8=224, that means k12=224*12-5 =2688-5=2683. So in this representation, f(12)=224, g(12)=-5.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: sometimes f(n) is just an integer that makes the product n*f(n) close to k_n, but not necessarily with remainder < n; it might be an arbitrary decomposition where g(n) can be any number. So then we have:\n\nk7 = 76 = 10*7 +6   so f(7)=10.\nk8 = 224 = 28*8 +0   so f(8)=28.\nk9 = 467, if written as something times 9 plus remainder: possibilities: 51*9=459, remainder 8; or 52*9=468, remainder -1. Which one is chosen? The text \"467/9 =51.89\" suggests that the division yields a quotient of 51 with a remainder of 8 if we use integer division rounding down. So then f(9)=51.\nk11 =1155 =105*11 +0 so f(11)=105.\nk12: they explicitly give representation \"224\u00d712 -5\", so f(12)=224.\n\nSo the answer would be: \nf(7) = 10, f(8) = 28, f(9) = 51, f(11) = 105, and f(12) = 224.\nBut then what about f(2), f(3), f(5)? Possibly they are given by similar decompositions:\nMaybe k2 is something like (something)*2 + remainder, etc. But the problem text provided only checks for keys 7,8,9,11,12.\n\nMaybe the full sequence of keys is known and we are asked: \"Find all keys that follow the pattern k_n = n * f(n) with some offset\" and then list them.\n\nI might re-read the question as given in the prompt: It says \"Check:\" followed by lines:\n1. 76/7 =10.86...\n2. 224/8=28\n3. 467/9=51.89\n4. 1155/11=105\n5. 2683/12=223.58... but then note that 2683 can be written as (k8)*12 - 5.\n\nSo it seems the pattern is: for some keys, when you divide by n, you get an integer; for others, you don't, and sometimes they are related to another key's value.\n\nThe puzzle might be about \"Which keys open which locks?\" And the answer is something like:\nKey 7: f(7)=10 (with offset 6)\nKey 8: f(8)=28 (offset 0)\nKey 9: f(9)=51 (offset 8)\nKey 11: f(11)=105 (offset 0)\nKey 12: f(12) can be taken as either 223 with offset 7 or 224 with offset -5, but the latter is chosen because it equals k8\u00d712 - 5.\n\nI suspect that the answer expected is just a statement like: \"The keys satisfy k_n = n * f(n) + g(n), where f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105 and f(12)=224. Notice that sometimes the offset g(n) is 0 (as for keys 8 and 11), while in other cases it is nonzero; moreover, one can express k_12 as k_8 \u00d7 12 - 5.\"\n\nI wonder if there's a known puzzle: \"The Locksmith's Keys\" where you have to match keys with locks by noticing that the lock number divides the key number in a particular way. There might be a pattern like f(n) = (n choose something) or maybe Fibonacci numbers.\n\nLet me see if 10,28,51,105,224 are familiar numbers: They resemble binomial coefficients? 10 is C(5,2)? Not sure.\n28 is the 7th triangular number. 51 is not triangular; 105 is triangular (105 = T20, actually T20=210/2 no, 105 is triangular because 14*15/2=105). And 224 is also triangular? Triangular numbers: 1,3,6,10,15,... 28 is T7, 36 is T8, 45 T9, 55 T10, 66 T11, 78 T12, 91 T13, 105 T14, 120 T15, 136 T16 (no), let's check: Triangular numbers sequence: 1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55,66,78,91,105,120,136,... So 28 is T7, 105 is T14. And 224? Not triangular because (sqrt(8*224+1)-1)/2 = (sqrt(1793)-1)/2 which is not integer. \nMaybe they are centered hexagonal numbers? Centered hexagonal numbers: 1,7,19,37,61,... no.\nMaybe they are the differences of cubes? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(n) corresponds to some known sequence: For n=8, f(8)=28; for n=11, f(11)=105. Notice that 28 and 105 are binomial coefficients from Pascal's triangle: 28 = C(8,2)? Actually, C(8,2)=28; 105 = C(15,?) no, 105 = C(15,2) is 105? Let me check: C(15,2)=105. And for n=7, f(7)=10 which equals C(5,2) maybe? For n=9, f(9)=51 which is not a common binomial coefficient though.\nFor n=12, f(12)=224 equals C(16,?) 224 = C(16,?) no, C(16,2)=120, C(16,3)=560, so not that.\n\nWait: maybe it's something like f(n) = (n-1 choose 2) + some constant. For n=7, (6 choose 2)=15, but 10 is less.\nMaybe f(n)=? \nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is: k_n = n * (something) and sometimes that something equals another key's value.\n\nThe fact that k12 can be written as k8\u00d712 - 5 suggests a relation between keys. Possibly the answer is to identify which keys are master keys that open multiple locks. The puzzle might be \"Which key opens which lock?\" And the answer: Key 7 does not fit perfectly (offset 6), key 8 fits exactly, key 9 nearly fits (offset 8), key 11 fits exactly, and key 12 can be represented in two ways.\n\nMaybe the final answer is: The keys are numbered by k = n f(n) + g(n), where f(7)=10, f(8)=28, f(9)=51, f(11)=105, and f(12)=224 (with corresponding offsets g(7)=6, g(8)=0, g(9)=8, g(11)=0, and g(12)=-5). In particular, key 12 has the special property that it can be expressed as k8\u00d712 - 5.\n\nThis is quite ambiguous. Possibly I should answer: \n\nObserving the given keys:\n\nFor k7 = 76, dividing by 7 gives approximately 10.857, so one can write 76 = 10\u00d77 + 6.\nFor k8 = 224, we have 224/8 = 28 exactly.\nFor k9 = 467, division yields 51 with a remainder of 8 (since 51\u00d79=459).\nFor k11 = 1155, division gives exactly 105.\nFor k12 = 2683, dividing by 12 yields about 223.583; however, noting that k8 is 224, we can write 2683 as 224\u00d712 - 5.\n\nThus, the pattern for keys is: \nk7 = 10\u00d77 + 6,\nk8 = 28\u00d78 + 0,\nk9 = 51\u00d79 + 8,\nk11 = 105\u00d711 + 0,\nand k12 can be written as 224\u00d712 - 5 (or equivalently 223\u00d712 + ?).\n\nSo, the answer: \nKey 7's multiplier is 10, key 8's is 28, key 9's is 51, key 11's is 105, and key 12's can be taken as 224 if we use k8. \n\nI might conclude: The keys that perfectly divide (with zero remainder) are keys 8 and 11. Key 7 leaves a remainder of 6; key 9 leaves a remainder of 8; and key 12, though not exact on division by 12, can be related to key 8 as k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5.\n\nMaybe the final answer: The keys follow the rule k_n = n \u00d7 f(n) + g(n). In our examples, we have:\nf(7)=10, g(7)=6;\nf(8)=28, g(8)=0;\nf(9)=51, g(9)=8;\nf(11)=105, g(11)=0;\nand k12 can be expressed as 224\u00d712 - 5 (using f(12)=224 and an offset of -5) or equivalently 223\u00d712 + ?.\nSince the problem specifically highlights that k12 = k8 \u00d7 12 - 5, it suggests a connection between keys 8 and 12.\n\nThus I'll answer: \n\nWhen dividing the key numbers by their respective indices n, we get:\n76/7 \u2248 10.86, so k7 can be written as 10\u00d77 + 6.\n224/8 = 28 exactly, so k8 = 28\u00d78.\n467/9 \u2248 51.89, so k9 = 51\u00d79 + 8.\n1155/11 = 105 exactly, so k11 = 105\u00d711.\n2683/12 \u2248 223.58, but since k8=224 we have k12 = 224\u00d712 - 5.\n\nThis pattern suggests that not all keys are \"perfect\" (i.e., with zero offset) and some key values can be re-expressed in terms of others; in this case, the 12th key is related to the 8th key by k12 = k8\u00d712 - 5.\n\nI'll now produce an answer that summarizes these observations.</think>One acceptable answer was to show that if we write each key number in the form\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2099 = n\u00b7f(n) + g(n)\n\nthen one may check that\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2087 = 76 = 7\u00b710 + 6,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2088 = 224 = 8\u00b728 + 0,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2089 = 467 = 9\u00b751 + 8,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022\u2003k\u2081\u2081 = 1155 = 11\u00b7105 + 0,\n\nand, although\n\u2003\u20032683 \u00f7 12 \u2248 223.58,\none may also note that since k\u2088 = 224 we have\n\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = 224\u00d712 \u2013 5 = 2688 \u2013 5 = 2683.\n\nIn other words, when you \u201cdivide\u201d each key by its index n you get approximately f(n) with a small offset g(n); in the cases of keys 7 and 9 the division is not exact (g(7)=6 and g(9)=8), while for keys 8 and 11 it is exact (g(8)=0 and g(11)=0). Moreover, key 12 has the special property that it may be written in terms of key 8:\n\u2003\u2003k\u2081\u2082 = k\u2088\u00d712 \u2013 5.\n\nAny answer which shows these facts is correct.",
