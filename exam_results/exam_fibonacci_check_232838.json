  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence relation of the form k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} or maybe with an added constant c. The user provided the equations for k7 and k8, so I guess those are part of the sequence. Let me start by focusing on the linear recurrence without the constant first, since it's simpler. \n\nThe problem gives two equations based on the recurrence relation:\n\n1. 76 = 49a + 21b  \n2. 224 = 76a + 49b\n\nWe need to solve for a and b here. Let me write them down clearly:\n\nEquation 1: 49a + 21b = 76  \nEquation 2: 76a + 49b = 224\n\nHmm, solving this system of equations. Let's see. Maybe use substitution or elimination. Since both equations have a and b, perhaps elimination would work. Let me try multiplying the equations to make coefficients line up. \n\nFirst, let me note the coefficients:\n\nEquation 1: 49a + 21b = 76  \nEquation 2: 76a + 49b = 224\n\nTo eliminate one variable, I can multiply the first equation by 76 and the second equation by 49. Wait, that might be too big. Alternatively, maybe find a common multiple for the coefficients of a or b. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe use substitution.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can solve for one variable in terms of the other from the first equation and substitute into the second. Let's try solving equation 1 for a:\n\nFrom equation 1:  \n49a = 76 - 21b  \n=> a = (76 - 21b)/49\n\nHmm, then substitute this into equation 2:\n\n76*( (76 - 21b)/49 ) + 49b = 224\n\nHmm, that looks messy but let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 76*(76 - 21b)/49:\n\nLet me compute numerator first: 76*(76 - 21b)  \n= 76*76 - 76*21b  \n= 5776 - 1596b\n\nThen divide by 49:\n\n(5776 - 1596b)/49\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n(5776 - 1596b)/49 + 49b = 224\n\nMultiply all terms by 49 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n5776 - 1596b + 49*49b = 224*49\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 5776  \nSecond term: -1596b  \nThird term: 49*49b = 2401b  \nRight side: 224*49. Let me compute that: 224*50 would be 11200, so subtract 224 gives 11200 - 224 = 10976.\n\nSo putting together:\n\n5776 -1596b + 2401b = 10976\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2401b - 1596b) = 805b  \nSo 5776 + 805b = 10976\n\nSubtract 5776 from both sides:\n\n805b = 10976 - 5776  \n805b = 5200\n\nThen b = 5200 / 805\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:  \n5200 \u00f75 = 1040  \n805 \u00f75 = 161  \nSo 1040/161 \u2248 6.46...\n\nHmm, 161*6 = 966  \n161*6.4 = 161*6 + 161*0.4 = 966 + 64.4 = 1030.4  \nBut 1040 - 1030.4 = 9.6, so 6.4 + (9.6/161) \u2248 6.4 + 0.06 = 6.46\n\nHmm, so b is approximately 6.46, which is not an integer. The problem mentioned \"Can you find integer a, b?\" so that's a problem. Since we need integer solutions, maybe this approach is not working. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an arithmetic error. Let me check calculations again.\n\nStarting over with substitution:\n\nEquation 1: 49a +21b =76  \nEquation 2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me try to use elimination instead.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 76 and equation 2 by 49. Wait, but that's big. Alternatively, maybe find a better multiplier.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider subtracting equations in some way. Let me think of the coefficients:\n\nEquation 1: 49a +21b =76  \nEquation 2:76a +49b =224\n\nLet me write the coefficients in matrix form:\n\n[49  21][a]   = [76]  \n[76  49][b]     [224]\n\nTo solve this system, maybe compute determinant?\n\nThe determinant D is (49)(49) - (21)(76)  \nCompute that: 49\u00b2 is 2401, and 21*76: 20*76=1520, 1*76=76, so 1520+76=1596  \nThus determinant D =2401 -1596= 805\n\nThen using Cramer's rule,\n\na = ( |76   21| ) / D  \n     |224 49|\n\nSo numerator determinant for a: 76*49 -21*224\n\nCompute 76*49: 70*49=3430, 6*49=294 \u2192 3430+294=3724  \n21*224: 20*224=4480 +1*224=224 \u2192 4480+224=4704  \nThus numerator a: 3724 -4704= -980  \nSo a= -980 /805 = divide numerator and denominator by 35? Let's see: 980 \u00f735=28, 805 \u00f735=23. So a= -28/23 \u2248 -1.217, which is not integer.\n\nSimilarly for b:\n\nb = ( |49 76| ) / D  \n      |76 224|\n\nNumerator determinant: 49*224 -76*76\n\nCompute 49*224: 50*224=11200 minus 1*224=224 \u2192 11200 -224=10976  \n76*76: 5776  \nThus numerator b: 10976 -5776 =5200  \nSo b=5200/805 = same as before, 5200/805 simplifies to 1040/161, which is about 6.46, not integer.\n\nHmm, so neither a nor b are integers. The problem asked \"Can you find integer a, b?\" so this suggests that with the given k7=76 and k8=224, there is no integer solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2}.\n\nBut the user also mentioned trying a recurrence with a constant term c, so maybe that could work. Let me try that.\n\nSo now, trying the recurrence k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2} + c.\n\nThen for k7=76, the equation would be:\n\n76 = a\u00d7k6 + b\u00d7k5 +c  \nWait, but hold on, the original problem mentions k7 and k8 in terms of previous terms. Wait, in the original setup, they had:\n\nFor k7 =76: 76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721  \nAssuming that k6=49 and k5=21?\n\nWait, actually the user's first equations are given as:\n\nFor k7 =76: 76= a\u00d749 +b\u00d721.  \nSo likely they are assuming that k6=49 and k5=21. Similarly, k7=76 and k8=224 is given. So to form equations for k8, it would be 224 = a\u00d776 +b\u00d749. \n\nBut if we are now trying with a constant term, then we need to have three equations to solve for a, b, c. But here we only have two data points (k7 and k8). Wait, unless we need more terms? Wait, maybe the user expects us to use previous terms?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is part of a larger sequence where k5, k6, etc., are known? But the problem statement isn't explicit. Wait, looking back at the user's question:\n\nThey wrote:\n\n\"For k7 = 76:\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n76 = 49a + 21b\n\nFor k8 = 224:\n224 = a\u00d776 + b\u00d749\n224 = 76a + 49b\"\n\nSo it seems they are assuming that k6 is 49 and k5 is 21. Because in the first equation for k7, it's written as a\u00d7k_{n-1} (which would be k6) and b\u00d7k_{n-2} (k5). So k5=21 and k6=49. So maybe the prior terms are known? For example, perhaps the sequence up to k6 is 21, 49, 76, etc. But since we need to test for a recurrence with constant term, we need three equations. \n\nWait, but with the given information, if we use the constant term, then for k7 and k8, we can write two equations with three variables (a, b, c). So that's underdetermined. Unless we have more terms. Wait, perhaps the user is referring to a previous part where more terms are given?\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Does the sequence follow a recurrence like k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2}?\" and then gives the equations for k7 and k8. So maybe they have more terms, but the user hasn't provided them here. Wait, the user says \"Also try: k_n = a\u00d7k_{n-1} + b\u00d7k_{n-2} + c. This is important - if there's a recurrence, we can predict k15, k16!\" So maybe the user is expecting to use the existing equations (for k7 and k8) but with a constant term, which requires three equations. Since we only have two terms, perhaps there is an assumption here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want us to assume that prior terms also follow the recurrence with the constant term. For example, if the recurrence is k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2} + c, then perhaps for k7 and k8, we can write two equations, but also maybe using k6 and k5?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me suppose that the recurrence holds for all n \u22653 (assuming starting from n=3). Then to form equations, we can use the previous terms. If we know k5, k6, k7, k8, then perhaps we can set up equations.\n\nWait, but in the given problem, the user only provides k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, and k8=224? Because in the equation for k7, they used k6=49 and k5=21. Then for k8, they use k7=76 and k6=49. So perhaps the prior terms are known?\n\nAssuming that, then if we are to include a constant term, we can use the equations for k7 and k8, but we need another equation. Let me see:\n\nSuppose that the recurrence starts at some point, so maybe for k7, the equation is:\n\nk7 = a k6 + b k5 + c  \nSimilarly, k8 = a k7 + b k6 + c  \nAnd maybe also k6 = a k5 + b k4 + c? But we don't know k4. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects to use the two equations for k7 and k8, but with three variables, so maybe set up equations with c being a variable and see if there's a solution. Let's try that.\n\nSo with the constant term:\n\nEquation1:76 = a*49 + b*21 + c  \nEquation2:224 = a*76 + b*49 + c\n\nSo now we have two equations with three variables. To solve, we need another equation. Perhaps the user assumes that the recurrence holds for k6 as well?\n\nWait, if we suppose that the recurrence holds for k6, then:\n\nk6 = a*k5 + b*k4 + c\n\nBut then we don't know k4. Hmm, unless the user is considering that maybe the recurrence starts at a lower n, but we have insufficient data. Alternatively, maybe the constant term is the same for all terms, so even with two equations, perhaps we can find a solution where c is a particular value?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made an error in the setup? Wait, perhaps the problem is that the test for the Fibonacci-like recurrence (without constant) failed because there are no integer solutions, so then trying with a constant term might allow for solutions?\n\nLet me proceed with the two equations for the constant term case:\n\nEquation1: 49a +21b +c =76  \nEquation2:76a +49b +c =224\n\nSubtract equation1 from equation2 to eliminate c:\n\n(76a +49b +c) - (49a +21b +c) =224 -76  \n=> (27a +28b) =148\n\nSo we have 27a +28b =148\n\nNow, we need to find integers a and b such that 27a +28b =148, and then c would be 76 -49a -21b.\n\nSo let me focus on solving 27a +28b =148 for integers a and b.\n\nThis is a linear Diophantine equation. Let's see if there are integer solutions.\n\nFirst, compute gcd(27,28). Since 27 and 28 are coprime (gcd=1), so there are solutions.\n\nWe can find particular solutions using the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nLet me recall that 27 and 28:\n\n28 =1*27 +1  \n27 =27*1 +0\n\nSo gcd is 1, and from first equation:  \n1 =28 -1*27\n\nMultiply both sides by148 to get:  \n148 =148*28 -148*27\n\nThus, one particular solution is a = -148, b=148.\n\nBut we can write the general solution. Since the equation is 27a +28b =148,\n\nthe general solution will be:\n\na = a0 + (28/d)*t  \nb = b0 - (27/d)*t\n\nwhere d is gcd(27,28)=1, and t is integer. So,\n\na = -148 +28t  \nb =148 -27t\n\nBut we can also find another particular solution with smaller numbers.\n\nAlternatively, let me use trial for small a and b.\n\nLooking for integers a and b such that 27a +28b =148.\n\nLet me try to find a solution:\n\nLet me solve for a in terms of b:\n\n27a =148 -28b  \n=> a=(148 -28b)/27\n\nWe need (148 -28b) divisible by27. Let me see:\n\nLet me try different b values.\n\nLet me see, 28b \u2261148 mod27.\n\nFirst, reduce 28 mod27: 28\u22611 mod27  \nSimilarly 148 mod27: 27*5=135, 148-135=13, so 148\u226113 mod27\n\nThus equation:  \n1*b \u226113 mod27  \n=> b \u226113 mod27\n\nSo the solutions for b are of the form b=13 +27k, where k is integer.\n\nThen a=(148 -28b)/27.\n\nTake b=13:  \na=(148 -28*13)/27 = (148 -364)/27 = (-216)/27= -8\n\nThus, a=-8, b=13 is a solution.\n\nAnother solution would be b=13+27=40, then a=(148 -28*40)/27=(148-1120)/27= (-972)/27= -36, etc.\n\nAlternatively, b=13-27= -14, then a=(148 -28*(-14))/27=(148+392)/27=540/27=20.\n\nSo another solution is a=20, b= -14.\n\nSo possible solutions:\n\na=-8, b=13  \na=20, b= -14  \na= -36, b=40  \netc.\n\nNow, we can pick one of these solutions and compute c.\n\nLet's try a=-8, b=13:\n\nThen c=76 -49a -21b =76 -49*(-8) -21*(13)\n\nCalculate:\n\n49*(-8)= -392  \n21*13=273  \nThus,\n\nc=76 +392 -273 = (76 +392)=468; 468-273=195\n\nSo c=195.\n\nSo one possible solution is a=-8, b=13, c=195.\n\nCheck in equation2:\n\n76a +49b +c =76*(-8) +49*(13)+195\n\n76*(-8)= -608  \n49*13=637  \n-608 +637=29  \n29 +195=224, which matches.\n\nAlternatively, try another solution, a=20, b=-14:\n\nc=76 -49*20 -21*(-14)=76 -980 +294= (76 +294)=370; 370-980= -610\n\nCheck in equation2:\n\n76*20 +49*(-14) + (-610)=1520 -686 -610=1520 -1296=224, which also works.\n\nSo there are infinitely many solutions for a, b, c with integer values. Therefore, there is a linear recurrence with constant term that fits the given k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224. \n\nHowever, the problem is asking \"Does the sequence follow a recurrence like...\", so perhaps it's expecting a minimal or simplest one, or maybe with smaller coefficients? The solutions above have different a, b, c. The first solution with a=-8, b=13, c=195 and the second a=20, b=-14, c=-610. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the constant term is the same for all terms, so that even prior terms would satisfy the recurrence. Let's test with the first solution.\n\nTake a=-8, b=13, c=195. Let's see if this recurrence holds for earlier terms.\n\nSuppose we have terms k1, k2, k3, k4, k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224.\n\nIf the recurrence holds for k6, then:\n\nk6 =a*k5 +b*k4 +c  \n49 = (-8)*21 +13*k4 +195  \n49 = -168 +13k4 +195  \n49 = 27 +13k4  \n=>13k4 =22  \nk4=22/13, which is not an integer. So that's a problem.\n\nSimilarly, with a=20, b=-14, c=-610:\n\nk6 =20*k5 + (-14)*k4 + (-610)  \n49 =20*21 -14k4 -610  \n49 =420 -14k4 -610  \n49 = -190 -14k4  \n=> -14k4 = 239  \nk4= -239/14, which is also not integer.\n\nTherefore, these solutions do not satisfy the recurrence for previous terms (assuming that the recurrence should hold for all terms from some n onwards). Thus, the problem is that with only two equations (for k7 and k8), we can't uniquely determine a recurrence with a constant term that also holds for prior terms unless we have more data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows a non-integer constant term? But the problem didn't specify that the coefficients must be integers, but in the initial problem without the constant, the user likely assumed integer coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects us to consider that the constant term is zero, but then we already saw that there is no solution. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the approach?\n\nWait, perhaps the user is only asking whether such a recurrence exists with any coefficients, not necessarily integers? If so, then there are infinitely many real solutions. But the problem mentions \"Does the sequence follow a recurrence like...\", which might imply existence, so the answer would be yes if any real numbers work, but likely the problem is expecting integer coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem setup, or maybe there is a different interpretation.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"For k7 =76:\n76 = a\u00d749 + b\u00d721\n76 =49a +21b\n\nFor k8 =224:\n224 = a\u00d776 +b\u00d749\n224 =76a +49b\"\n\nSo they set up equations assuming that k6=49 and k5=21 for k7, and k7=76 and k6=49 for k8. Then they want to know if there is a linear recurrence without constant, which requires solving the system:\n\n49a +21b =76  \n76a +49b =224\n\nWe saw that this system has no integer solutions, as the determinant is 49*49 - 21*76 = 2401 - 1596 = 805. Then the solution is:\n\na=(76*49 -21*224)/805\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n76*49: 70*49=3430, 6*49=294 \u2192 3430+294=3724  \n21*224: 20*224=4480 +1*224=4704  \nThus numerator: 3724 -4704= -980  \nThus a= -980 /805 = -196/161 \u2248 -1.217\n\nSimilarly, b=(49*224 -76*76)/805\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n49*224 = 49*(200+24)=49*200=9800 +49*24=1176 \u2192 total 10976  \n76*76=5776  \nThus numerator:10976 -5776 = 5200  \nb=5200/805=1040/161\u22486.46\n\nSo non-integer coefficients. Therefore, no integer solution.\n\nHence, the answer to the first part is no, there is no such integer linear recurrence without a constant term.\n\nThen, moving to the constant term: as above, there are infinitely many real solutions, but if the problem requires integer coefficients, then with two equations and three variables, you can always find a solution unless the equations are inconsistent. Since they are not inconsistent, there are solutions, but they might not align with prior terms.\n\nAlternatively, if the question allows for real coefficients, then yes, there exists a recurrence with a constant term. But since the user mentioned \"Fibonacci-like\", which typically has integer coefficients, maybe the answer is that without a constant term it doesn't work but with a constant term it does.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be expecting to use the two equations for the constant term case and find a solution. Since we can choose any of the integer solutions found earlier, even if they don't align with prior terms, maybe the existence is sufficient.\n\nHence, the final answer would be that with a constant term, such a recurrence exists, so the answer is yes. But since the user might want the coefficients, but the question is phrased as \"Does the sequence follow...\", so yes it can with a constant term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me see:\n\nSuppose we consider the system of equations:\n\n49a +21b +c =76  \n76a +49b +c =224\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(76a -49a) + (49b -21b) + (c -c) =224-76  \n27a +28b =148\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n49a +21b +c =76  \n27a +28b =148\n\nWe can solve for a and b:\n\nLet me solve 27a +28b =148.\n\nWe can write as 27a =148 -28b \u2192 a=(148 -28b)/27\n\nTo have integer a and b, 148 -28b must be divisible by 27.\n\nLet me see possible integer b values:\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n28b =148 -27a\n\nLooking for integer a, b such that 28 divides (148 -27a)\n\nLet me try possible a values:\n\nLet me suppose a is integer. Let me see:\n\nLet me set 148 -27a \u22610 mod28\n\n148 mod28: 28*5=140, so 148-140=8 \u2192 148\u22618 mod28\n\n27a mod28: 27\u2261-1 mod28, so 27a \u2261-a mod28\n\nThus equation: 8 - (-a) \u22610 mod28 \u21928 +a \u22610 mod28 \u2192a\u2261-8 mod28 \u2192a=20 mod28 (since -8+28=20)\n\nThus, a=20 +28k, for integer k.\n\nThen:\n\nb=(148 -27a)/28\n\nPlugging a=20:\n\nb=(148 -540)/28= (-392)/28= -14 \u2192 so b= -14, a=20. Then c=76 -49a -21b =76 -49*20 -21*(-14)=76-980+294= -610 as before.\n\nAnother solution with k= -1: a=20-28= -8, then b=(148 -27*(-8))/28=(148+216)/28=364/28=13. Which is the first solution.\n\nThus, the minimal solutions are a=20,b=-14,c=-610 or a=-8,b=13,c=195.\n\nThus, there are integer solutions, so yes, with a constant term, the recurrence exists.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, and the coefficients can be such as a=-8, b=13, c=195 or others. However, since the problem might just want the existence, the answer is yes, and to present in boxed form perhaps the coefficients? But the problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". Maybe they just want the existence, so \\boxed{Yes} but instructions might expect equation? Alternatively, since the user mentioned \"Fibonacci-like\", which usually is second order linear without constant term, so maybe the answer is no, but with constant term yes.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might want the coefficients. Let me check the problem again:\n\nThe user says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". Since the question is \"Does the sequence follow a recurrence like...\", which is a yes/no question, but in math problems, sometimes the answer is the coefficients. Wait, the original problem in Chinese might have been different, but given the translation here, it's ambiguous. However, given the initial equations set up, the user might want the coefficients of the recurrence, but since there are infinitely many, perhaps the simplest one?\n\nLooking at the two integer solutions:\n\nFirst solution: a=-8, b=13, c=195\n\nSecond solution: a=20, b=-14, c=-610\n\nThe first solution has smaller absolute values, so maybe that's preferable.\n\nThus, the recurrence relation is:\n\nk_{n} = -8 k_{n-1} +13 k_{n-2} +195\n\nBut the question didn't specify to provide the equation, but given the instructions, maybe the answer is \\boxed{Yes}, but considering the standard Fibonacci-like is second order linear homogeneous, so without constant term, so maybe the answer is no, but with a constant term yes. But since the user explicitly mentioned \"Fibonacci-like\" which is usually homogeneous, so the answer might be no. However, the user also mentioned \"with a constant term\" in the problem statement? Let me check the user's question again:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"Fibonacci-like\"\n\nthen later says:\n\n\"the problem might want the existence, so the answer is yes, and to present in boxed form perhaps the coefficients? But the problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". Since the question is \"Does the sequence follow a recurrence like...\", which is a yes/no question...\"\n\nWait, the original problem in the user's message is:\n\n\"Fibonacci-like\n\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}\"\n\nWait, maybe the problem is different. Wait, the user's message might have been pasted incorrectly. Let me check the user's exact input:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"Fibonacci-like\n\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}\"\n\nBut that's the entire problem? That seems incomplete. Wait, maybe the user intended to write a problem but it was cut off? Alternatively, maybe the problem is to determine if a given sequence is Fibonacci-like, but the user didn't specify the sequence? Hmm, perhaps a translation error or incomplete problem.\n\nWait, the initial problem in the user's message is exactly as above? Let me check again:\n\nThe user's query is:\n\n\"Fibonacci-like\n\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}\"\n\nThat's all? That can't be. Maybe there was a formatting issue. Alternatively, perhaps the actual problem was in Chinese, and the translation resulted in the above. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the initial equations provided in their thought process?\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe user starts with:\n\n\"Fibonacci-like\n\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}\"\n\nThen the user wrote a long thought process discussing equations involving k5=21, k6=49, k7=76, k8=224, setting up recurrence relations. So perhaps the actual problem is: Given the terms of a sequence where the 5th term is 21, 6th is 49, 7th is 76, 8th is 224, does this sequence follow a Fibonacci-like recurrence (i.e., a second-order linear recurrence with constant coefficients, possibly with a constant term)?\n\nHence, the problem is to determine if such a recurrence exists. The Fibonacci-like usually refers to a recurrence like k_n = a k_{n-1} + b k_{n-2}, so without a constant term. In that case, the answer would be no, as shown in the thought process, but with a constant term, the answer is yes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that without a constant term: No, but with a constant term: Yes. Since the question says \"Fibonacci-like\", which is typically without constant term, so the answer is No. But the user might have intended to include a constant term, so maybe the answer is Yes. However, given the standard definition, Fibonacci-like is linear homogeneous, so the answer is No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a specific source where \"Fibonacci-like\" includes constant terms. Given the user's equations, they set up the problem with four terms and wanted a second-order recurrence, which with constant term is possible, so the answer is Yes.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the thought process where the user found that with a constant term it is possible, while without it is not, and the problem says \"Fibonacci-like\" which might allow constants, the answer is \\boxed{Yes}.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem requires the standard Fibonacci recurrence (without constant term), then the answer is \\boxed{No}.\n\nBut given the user's detailed thought process leading to the existence with constant term, and since they asked to put the final answer boxed, likely the answer is Yes, so boxed yes.\n\nBut in math problems like this, if it's a yes/no, boxed yes or no. Given the problem might be \"does there exist a linear recurrence...\", then yes. So the answer is \\boxed{Yes}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{Yes}\n",
