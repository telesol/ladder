Are there bit-rotation relationships?\n\nFind binary patterns that could help predict k15.\"\n\nWe have a sequence of numbers: k1, k2, ..., k14.\nLet's list keys with their decimal and binary representation:\n\nk1=1 (binary: 1)\nk2=3 (binary: 11)\nk3=7 (binary: 111)\nk4=8 (binary: 1000)\nk5=21 (binary: 10101) [Wait, check: 21 in binary is indeed 10101.]\nk6=49 (binary: 110001)\nk7=76 (binary: 1001100)\nk8=224 (binary: 11100000)\nk9=467 (binary: 111010011) \nk10=514 (binary: 1000000010)\nk11=1155 (binary: 10010000011)\nk12=2683 (binary: 101001111011)\nk13=5765 (binary: 1011010000101)\nk14=10544 (binary: 10100100110000)\n\nWe are given some analysis instructions. Let's analyze:\n\nObservations:\n- The binary representations of k1, k2, k3: They are all numbers of the form with all bits set to 1: k1=1 = (1), k2=3 = (11), k3=7 = (111). So these are like Mersenne numbers.\n- Then k4=8 is a power-of-two; so not of that pattern, it's \"1000\".\n- k5=21 is 10101 which has alternating bits starting with '1'? Actually 10101 means the ones alternate. It might be related to Fibonacci? Not sure.\n\nMaybe we can try to see if there's any recurrence? The sequence: 1, 3, 7, 8, 21, 49, 76, 224, 467, 514, 1155, 2683, 5765, 10544\nIt is not trivially arithmetic or geometric. But the question asks \"Find binary patterns that could help predict k15.\" So we need to analyze bit pattern properties.\n\nI'll try: \n1) Number of set bits:\nk1=1, has one '1'.\nk2=3 (11) has 2 ones.\nk3=7 (111) has 3 ones.\nk4=8 (1000) has 1 one.\nk5=21 (10101) has 3 ones.\nk6=49 (110001) has 3 ones.\nk7=76 (1001100) has 3 ones.\nk8=224 (11100000) has 3 ones? Actually, let's count: \"11100000\" is three ones and five zeros. k9=467 (111010011) count ones: 1+1+1+0+1+0+0+1+1 => that's 6 ones maybe? Let's recalc: digits for 467: The binary representation given is \"111010011\". Count: '1','1','1' then '0', then '1','0','0','1','1'. So count=3+3 =6. \nk10=514 (1000000010) has ones? \"1000000010\": count=2.\nk11=1155 (10010000011) count: digits: 1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1 => count=4.\nk12=2683 (101001111011): Count bits: digits: '1','0','1','0','0','1','1','1','1','0','1','1' => count maybe 7? Let's recalc: ones at positions: first digit is 1, then third is 1, then sixth, seventh, eighth, tenth, and twelfth. So count = 7.\nk13=5765 (1011010000101): Count bits: digits: '1','0','1','1','1','0','0','0','0','1','0','1'. Count ones: positions: first digit is 1, third digit is 1, fourth digit is 1, then at ninth maybe? Let's recalc carefully. \"1011010000101\"\n- digits: index1: '1', index2: '0', index3: '1', index4: '1', index5: '1', index6: '0', index7: '0', index8: '0', index9: '0', index10: '1', index11: '0', index12: '1'. So count ones = 1+? Actually, we sum:\npositions: 1,3,4,5,9,12: that's 6 ones.\nk14=10544 (10100100110000) count bits: digits: '1','0','1','0','0','1','0','0','1','1','0','0','0','0'. Count ones = positions: index1, index3, index6, index9, index10? Let's recalc:\n\"10100100110000\"\n= 1 (pos1), then pos2:0, pos3:1, pos4:0, pos5:0, pos6:1, pos7:0, pos8:0, pos9:1, pos10:1, pos11:0, pos12:0, pos13:0, pos14:0.\nCount = 1 + 1+1+1? Let's count properly: ones at positions: 1,3,6,9,10 = 5 ones.\n\nSo bit counts sequence: [k1=1, k2=2, k3=3, k4=1, k5=3, k6=3, k7=3, k8=3, k9=6, k10=2, k11=4, k12=7, k13=6, k14=5]. Not obvious pattern.\n\nMaybe check leading bit positions:\nLeading bit position for a number k is floor(log2(k)) + 1.\nFor k1: log2(1)=0 so floor =0+1=1. For k2=3, log2(3) ~1.58 so floor =1 then plus one equals 2, but that's not the binary length? Actually for a number n, the number of bits is floor(log2(n)) + 1 if n>0.\nSo: \nk1=1, floor(log2(1))+1=0+1=1.\nk2=3, floor(log2(3))+1 =1+1=2.\nk3=7 gives floor(log2(7))+1 = 2+1=3.\nk4=8 gives floor(log2(8))+1=3+1=4.\nk5=21: log2(21)=4.392, so floor=4 then plus one equals 5 bits.\nk6=49: log2(49) ~5.61 so floor=5 then +1=6 bits.\nk7=76: log2(76) ~6.24 so floor=6 then +1=7 bits.\nk8=224: log2(224) ~7.81 so floor=7 then +1=8 bits.\nk9=467: log2(467) ~8.53, floor=8+1=9 bits? But given binary has 9 digits \"111010011\" is indeed 9 bits.\nk10=514: log2(514)~9.00, so floor=9 then +1=10 bits.\nk11=1155: log2(1155) ~10.17, floor=10+1=11 bits, matches \"10010000011\" has 11 bits.\nk12=2683: log2(2683)=11.04? Actually check: 2^11=2048, 2^12=4096, so 2683 is between them so it's 12 bits, yes.\nk13=5765: should be 13 bits.\nk14=10544: should be 14 bits.\n\nSo leading bit positions: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. So that's simply increasing by one. That pattern is trivial because it's just the number of bits needed to represent k.\n\nNow XOR patterns: It says \"Any XOR patterns? k3 XOR k4 = 7 XOR 8 = 15\". Let me check: 7 (111) XOR 8 (1000). But careful, if they align them as same length maybe we need to pad with zeros. If we pad: 0111 XOR 1000 = 1111 which equals 15. So that might be a pattern.\n\nMaybe look at differences:\nk2 - k1=2, k3 - k2=4, k4 - k3=1, k5 - k4=13, k6 - k5=28, k7 - k6=27, k8 - k7=148, k9 - k8=243, k10 - k9=47? Let's recalc: Actually the sequence differences:\nk1=1\nk2=3, diff=+2.\nk3=7, diff=+4.\nk4=8, diff=+1.\nk5=21, diff=+13.\nk6=49, diff=+28.\nk7=76, diff=+27.\nk8=224, diff=+148.\nk9=467, diff=+243.\nk10=514, diff=+47.\nk11=1155, diff=+641.\nk12=2683, diff=+1528.\nk13=5765, diff=+3082.\nk14=10544, diff= +  (10544-5765)= +  479? Actually recalc: 10544 -5765 = 4779. So differences are not monotonic in any clear pattern.\n\nMaybe there is a recursive relationship:\nCheck ratios?\n3/1=3, 7/3 approx 2.33, 8/7 ~1.14, 21/8=2.625, etc. Not obvious.\n\nNow \"bit rotation relationships\"? We might check if some numbers are rotations of others. For example, k1 =1 (binary \"1\"). If you rotate it, nothing changes.\nk2=3 (\"11\"): rotated version? Rotating \"11\" gives same result.\nk3=7 (\"111\") rotates to itself.\nThen k4=8 is \"1000\". Its rotation might produce \"0001\", which equals 1 (but that's not in sequence).\nMaybe check k5: 21 = \"10101\". Rotating yields maybe 01011 = 11 decimal? Not sure.\n\nk6=49: binary \"110001\". If we rotate left by some bits, do we get one of these keys? For example, if we rotate right: \"110001\" rotated to \"011100\"? That equals decimal 28 maybe? But k7 is 76. \nWait, check k7: 76 = \"1001100\". Its rotation might be something like \"0011001\" equals 25 or similar.\nk8=224 = \"11100000\", rotate yields something like \"00001111\" equals 15; not in sequence.\n\nMaybe the XOR pattern: k3 (111) XOR k4 (1000) gives 1111 which is binary for 15. But then maybe k4 (1000) XOR k5? Let's check: k4=8 (\"1000\") and k5=21 (\"10101\"). To align them, pad k4 as \"01000\"? Then XOR might yield some pattern?\n\"01000\"\n\"10101\"\nXOR = \"11101\" which equals 29 decimal. Not sure.\n\nWhat is the significance of 15? k3 XOR k4 = 7 XOR 8=15. And note that 15 in binary is 1111, which has all ones and is one less than a power of two. It might be hinting at some relationship like \"complement\" or \"mirror\".\n\nMaybe check: k2=3 (\"11\"), complement? The bitwise complement of 7 would be ... not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence itself is defined by something like a recursion where each term's binary representation is obtained from the previous one with some operations (maybe XOR shift, rotate, etc). I might try to see if there is any recurrence between bits. For instance:\nk1: 1\nk2: 11 (just append bit maybe)\nk3: 111 (append a 1 at end?) then k4: 1000 (reset with a single 1 in front and zeros afterwards)\n\nMaybe the pattern \"Mersenne numbers\" appear for first three terms, but then break.\n\nI can try to see if any term is a rotation of another. For instance, k3=7 has binary representation \"111\". If you rotate right by one, you get \"111\". Not helpful.\nk4 = 8 (\"1000\"). If we rotate left by one: \"0001\" equals 1, which is k1 but not in sequence order.\n\nMaybe the XOR pattern: The problem statement says \"k3 XOR k4 = 7 XOR 8 = 15\". Possibly then k4 XOR k5 might equal something? Let's try: k4=8 (\"1000\") and k5=21 (\"10101\"). To align them, I'll represent both in same length. k4 is 4 bits \"1000\", but to compare with 5-bit representation for k5, pad k4 as \"01000\". Then XOR = \"11101\" which equals binary: 1*16 + 1*8 + 1*4 + 0*2 + 1=16+8+4+1=29 decimal. And maybe then next one: k5 (10101) and k6 (110001, which is 6 bits). Pad k5 as \"010101\". XOR =? Let's do that:\nk5 padded to 6 bits: \"010101\"\nk6: \"110001\"\nXOR digit-wise: \n0 xor 1 =1,\n1 xor 1=0,\n0 xor 0=0,\n1 xor 0=1,\n0 xor 0=0,\n1 xor 1=0.\nThat yields \"100100\" in binary which equals 36 decimal. Not sure if pattern emerges.\n\nMaybe XOR of k6 and k7: k6 = 49 (\"110001\") is 6 bits; k7=76 (\"1001100\") is 7 bits, pad k6 as \"0110001\". Then XOR:\n0 xor 1=1,\n1 xor 0=1,\n1 xor 0=1,\n0 xor 0=0? Let's do carefully:\nk6 padded: \"0110001\"\nk7: \"1001100\"\nXOR digit wise:\n0\u22951 =1\n1\u22950 =1\n1\u22950 =1\n0\u22950 =0\n0\u22951 =1\n1\u22950 =1? Wait, we need to align digits properly. Let's do positions from left: k6 padded: bit1:0, bit2:1, bit3:1, bit4:0, bit5:0, bit6:0, bit7:1; k7 bits: 1,0,0,1,1,0,0.\nXOR:\nbit1: 0 xor 1=1,\nbit2: 1 xor 0=1,\nbit3: 1 xor 0=1,\nbit4: 0 xor 1=1,\nbit5: 0 xor 1=1,\nbit6: 0 xor 0=0,\nbit7: 1 xor 0=1.\nSo result \"1111101\" which equals binary for 125 decimal (64+32+16+8+4+0+1 =125). Not obviously pattern.\n\nPerhaps we should consider possibility that k3 XOR k4 gives a power of two minus one, i.e., 15. And maybe there is a general rule like: The XOR of two consecutive terms yields a number whose binary representation has all ones (i.e., is of the form 2^n - 1)? Check if that holds for any other pair:\nk2 XOR k3? k2=3 (\"11\") padded to length of k3 (which is \"111\", so pad as \"011\"), XOR = \"011\" XOR \"111\" equals \"100\" which is 4, not all ones.\nk4 XOR k5 we already did gave 29 which is not a number with consecutive ones? \n29 in binary is 11101, which has four ones and one zero. Not pattern.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that sometimes the XOR gives a perfect square or something: 7 XOR 8=15 (not square), but 21 XOR ? No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence itself is defined by bitwise operations? For example, k(n+1) = binary rotation of k(n)? Let's test:\nk1: \"1\", rotate right might yield \"1\".\nk2: \"11\" if we rotate \"1\" maybe add a bit.\nMaybe not.\n\nWait, consider differences in bit length. They are increasing by 1 each time. So it seems that the sequence is defined as numbers with increasing number of bits. And possibly their binary representation is constructed digit by digit from left to right. Could it be something like: k(n) has a binary representation where the digits alternate between 0 and 1 starting with 1? But then:\nn=1: \"1\"\nn=2: should be \"10\"? But k2=3 (\"11\") so that doesn't match.\nMaybe they are constructed by taking some \"mirror\" property. For instance, k4 = 8 is 1000 and its complement (in a fixed width of 4 bits) would be 0111 which equals 7, which is k3. So maybe there's a relationship: k3 + k4 = 15? And 15 in binary is 1111.\nThen check: k5=21 in 5-bit and its complement is 10 (binary 01010)? Not sure.\n\nMaybe the sequence has to do with the sums of digits or differences between mirror numbers. For instance, k3 + k4 = 7+8 =15 which equals 2^4 -1.\nThen k4 + ? That doesn't hold for others maybe: k5=21 and its complement in 5 bits would be (31-21)=10 but that's not in sequence.\n\nMaybe the sequence is: start with 1, then add 2, then add 4, then add 1, then add 13, etc. The differences seem erratic. Possibly they are generated by a polynomial? Let me check indices:\nTerm index vs value:\nn=1: 1\nn=2: 3\nn=3: 7\nn=4: 8\nn=5: 21\nn=6: 49\nn=7: 76\nn=8: 224\nn=9: 467\nn=10:514\nn=11:1155\nn=12:2683\nn=13:5765\nn=14:10544\n\nMaybe it's a known sequence? Possibly the sequence of numbers that are not powers of 2 but close to them? k4 is exactly power of 2 (8) and then next ones add some bits. Not sure.\n\nMaybe we can try to see if there's any relation with binary representation digits themselves. Write each in binary with full width:\n\nk1: bit length=1: 1\nk2: bit length=2: 11\nk3: bit length=3: 111\nk4: bit length=4: 1000\nk5: bit length=5: 10101\nk6: bit length=6: 110001\nk7: bit length=7: 1001100\nk8: bit length=8: 11100000\nk9: bit length=9: 111010011? Actually, given k9=467 in 9-bit binary. Let's recalc: 467 in binary is indeed 111010011 (1*256 +1*128+1*64+0*32+1*16+0*8+0*4+1*2+1*1 =256+128+64+16+2+1=467). k10=514, which in binary: 514 decimal is 1000000010? Let's check: 512 + 2=514 so yes.\nk11=1155 in binary (should be 11 bits): 1155 = 1024+128-? Wait recalc: 1155 - 1024 =131, then 131=64+32+16+16 is not. Let's do properly:\n1155 decimal in binary: 1155 /2 repeatedly? I'll trust given representation \"10010000011\".\nk12=2683 (12 bits): presumably \"101001010011\" maybe.\nk13=5765 (13 bits)\nk14=10544 (14 bits)\n\nMaybe the pattern is that when you flip a certain bit from 0 to 1 or vice versa in the binary representation of k(n), you get k(n+?).\n\nMaybe consider XOR differences: \nLet A = k3 XOR k4 gave 15, which in full width 4-bit representation is \"1111\". Then maybe k8 XOR k9? Let's try:\nk8=224, 8 bits \"11100000\".\nk9=467, but 467 in binary as an 8-bit number: it must be 9 bits actually because 467 >=256. So for consistency, use 9 bits for both k8 and k9 by padding k8 with a leading zero: \"011100000\". XOR with k9 \"111010011\": \n0 xor 1=1,\n1 xor 1=0,\n1 xor 1=0,\n1 xor 0=1? Let's do step-by-step:\n\"011100000\"\nXOR\n\"111010011\"\nBit by bit (from left, index1 to 9):\nbit1:0 XOR 1 = 1,\nbit2:1 XOR 1 = 0,\nbit3:1 XOR 1 = 0,\nbit4:1 XOR 0 = 1,\nbit5:0 XOR 1 = 1? Let's recalc properly:\nI need to align them correctly:\n\nk8 in 9-bit is: since k8=224, in binary normally it is 11100000 (8 bits). To get 9 bits, pad with a 0 on left: \"011100000\".\nk9 =467 in 9-bit is given as: we computed earlier: 467 = 1*256 + 128+64+16+2+1? Let's compute properly:\n467 /256 = 1 remainder 211,\n211/128=1 remainder 83,\n83/64=1 remainder 19,\n19/32=0, 19/16=1 remainder 3,\n3/8=0, 3/4=0, 3/2=1, remainder 1? That seems off.\nBetter: 467 in binary: The largest power of 2 less than 467 is 256. So bit for 256 = 1, remainder 211.\nNext, 128 fits into 211 once so next bit=1, remainder 83.\n64 fits into 83 once so bit=1, remainder 19.\n32 does not fit so bit=0,\n16 fits into 19 once so bit=1, remainder 3.\n8 does not fit so bit=0,\n4 does not fit so bit=0,\n2 fits into 3 once so bit=1, remainder 1,\n1 fits so bit=1.\nSo binary: 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 = \"111010011\". That matches given.\n\nNow XOR them:\n\"011100000\"\n\"111010011\"\nXOR digit by digit:\n0 xor 1 = 1,\n1 xor 1 = 0,\n1 xor 1 = 0,\n1 xor 0 = 1, (carry over)\n0 xor 1 = 1,\n0 xor 0 = 0,\n0 xor 0 = 0? Wait let's do carefully index:\nbit1: 0 \u2295 1 =1\nbit2: 1 \u2295 1=0\nbit3: 1 \u2295 1=0\nbit4: 1 \u2295 0=1? Actually bit4: in first number: \"011100000\": digits: positions:\nbit1:0, bit2:1, bit3:1, bit4:1, bit5:0, bit6:0, bit7:0, bit8:0, bit9:0.\n\"111010011\": bits: 1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1.\nSo XOR:\nbit1: 0 \u2295 1 =1\nbit2: 1 \u2295 1 =0\nbit3: 1 \u2295 1 =0\nbit4: 1 \u2295 0 =1\nbit5: 0 \u2295 1 =1\nbit6: 0 \u2295 0 =0\nbit7: 0 \u2295 0 =0? Actually check bit7: first number: position7 is 0, second: position7 is 0, so 0.\nbit8: 0 \u2295 1 =1\nbit9: 0 \u2295 1 =1\n\nSo result becomes \"100110001\". That is not a string of all ones. So no.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the XOR of k3 and k4 yields 2^4 -1, which is the full width in binary for 4 bits? And maybe there's a similar relationship: k(n) XOR something equals 2^(bit_length+1)-1 sometimes. Let's check bit lengths:\nk3 (7) has bit length 3, and k4=8 has bit length 4. Their XOR gave 15 which is 2^4 -1.\nMaybe for other indices, if one term has bit length L and the next term has bit length L+1, then their XOR might equal 2^(L+1)-1? Check: k2 (bit length=2) and k3 (bit length=3). 3 in binary is \"11\" (but should be represented as 2 bits?) Actually, to compare them with same width, we represent the smaller one in L bits. For k2, bit length 2 representation: \"11\". For k3, use 3-bit representation: \"111\". XOR \"11\" \u2295 \"111\": But need to pad k2 to 3 bits: \"011\" \u2295 \"111\" = \"100\", which equals 4, not 7. So that pattern doesn't hold.\n\nMaybe the pattern is only for the pair (k3, k4). That stands out because k3=7 and k4=8 are consecutive integers with a dramatic change in binary representation: from all ones to a one followed by zeros. And their XOR gives a number with all ones in 4-bit width. \nMaybe the sequence is defined recursively as: start with 1, then double plus something? Let's try differences:\n3-1=2\n7-3=4\n8-7=1\n21-8=13\n49-21=28\n76-49=27\n224-76=148\n467-224=243\n514-467=47\n1155-514=641\n2683-1155=1528\n5765-2683=3082\n10544-5765=4779\n\nThese differences: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,47,641,1528,3082,4779.\nNot obviously arithmetic.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined by a bitwise rule such as \"k(n+1) = k(n) + (bit_length(k(n)))\" maybe? Let's test:\nFor k1=1, bit length = 1, so next would be 1+1=2 but actually k2=3.\nOr maybe k(n+1)= k(n) + reverse_binary(k(n))? For k3=7, binary \"111\", its reverse is also 7, then adding gives 14, not 8.\nMaybe k(n+1) = complement of k(n) in the current bit length? That would give: for k3 (in 3 bits) complement of 7 (111) in 3 bits is 000 which is 0, not 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's like \"k(n+1) = next power of 2 if n mod something equals ?\" because we see a jump from 7 to 8.\nLet's check indices where bit length increases: k1 (bit len=1), then k2 (bit len=2), then k3 (bit len=3), then k4 (bit len=4). So it seems every term increases the number of bits until we hit a new power of 2? But then k5 is 21, which has bit length 5. That fits: numbers in the range [16,31] have 5 bits. And indeed 21 is in that range. Then k6=49 (bit length 6), but note that 49 is less than 64 and greater than 32? Actually, for 6-bit numbers, they run from 32 to 63. So k7 should be within that range if it continued with increasing bit lengths: k7=76, which is not in [32,63]. So maybe the pattern is that sometimes we jump to a higher bit length earlier.\n\nMaybe it's about binary palindromes? Let's check:\n1 (binary \"1\") - palindrome.\n3 (binary \"11\") - palindrome.\n7 (binary \"111\") - palindrome.\n8 (binary \"1000\") - not palindrome normally, but if you consider rotation maybe?\n21 in binary is \"10101\", which is a palindrome.\n49 in binary is \"110001\" reversed is \"100011\", so no.\n76 in binary is \"1001100\". Reverse gives \"0011001\" = 73, not same.\n224 in binary (8-bit) is \"11100000\". Not palindrome.\n467 in binary is \"111010011\", which if reversed becomes \"110100111\"? Not sure.\n\nMaybe it's about numbers with a specific property like having a prime number of 1's? Let's count ones:\nk1: 1 -> one '1'.\nk2: 3 (11) has two 1's.\nk3: 7 (111) has three 1's.\nk4: 8 (1000) has one '1'. So pattern might be that the number of 1's in binary alternates between increasing and then dropping to 1 sometimes? k5=21, \"10101\" has three ones. k6=49, \"110001\" has three ones as well.\nk7=76, \"1001100\" has three ones maybe: 76 = 64+8+4? Actually, 64+8+4=76 so binary is 1001100 which has three ones.\nk8=224, \"11100000\" has three ones.\nk9=467, \"111010011\", count ones: 1+1+1+0+1+0+0+1+1 =6 ones? Let's recalc 467: \"111010011\": digits are: 1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1 so that is 6 ones.\nk10=514, binary \"1000000010\" has two ones (512 and 2).\nk11=1155, count ones in \"10010000011\": that's 1+0+0+1+0+0+0+0+0+1+1 = 4 ones.\nk12=2683, not sure.\nNot obviously.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined by: a(1)=1, and for n>1, a(n) is the smallest number greater than a(n-1) whose binary representation contains no consecutive zeros? Let's test:\n1 in binary \"1\" works.\n3 in binary \"11\" has consecutive ones which are fine. But maybe rule is no consecutive ones? 11 has consecutive ones though.\nOr maybe it's numbers that have exactly two 1's sometimes.\n\nI think we might try to see if the sequence appears in OEIS. Possibly known as \"Sylvester's sequence\"? Sylvester's sequence: 2,3,7,15,31,... but our sequence is different: 1,3,7,8,21,49,76,...\n\nMaybe it's \"binary carry\" sequence? The differences between terms might correspond to the binary representation of n. For instance:\nk1=1 (binary 1)\nk2=3 (binary 11) difference =10 in binary which is 2.\nk3=7 (111) difference from k2: 4 which is 100.\nk4=8 (1000) difference from k3: 1 which is 001? Not sure.\n\nMaybe the differences are: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,47,641,1528,3082,4779. These don't immediately show a pattern in binary.\nLet's write them in binary:\n2 = 10,\n4 = 100,\n1 = 1,\n13 = 1101,\n28 = 11100,\n27 = 11011,\n148 = 10010100? (in binary: 128+16+4=148, so 10010100),\n243 = 111100011? Actually 243 in binary is 11110011.\n47 = 101111,\n641 = 1010000001,\n1528 = ? \n3082 = ?\n4779 = ?\n\nNot obvious.\n\nMaybe the sequence has something to do with the representation of primes in binary. Check: 3,7,21,49? But 21 and 49 are composite though.\nWait 49=7^2, but 7 already appeared.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe each term after the first is obtained by taking the previous term's binary representation, reversing it, and then adding something. For example:\n1 in binary: \"1\". Reverse \"1\" = \"1\", then maybe add 2 to get 3? That doesn't hold.\n7 (111) reversed is still 111 = 7, but k4=8 which is not 14.\n\nMaybe it's like a(n) = n-th term of the sequence defined by: a(0)=1, and a(n+1) is the smallest number greater than a(n) whose binary representation does not contain \"010\"? For instance:\na(1)=3 (11 in binary),\na(2)=7 (111 in binary), a(3)=8 (1000 in binary), maybe because 010 pattern appears?\nNot sure.\n\nI think we should consider the possibility that the sequence might be generated by some known recurrence or property. The jump from 7 to 8 is notable: 7 in binary \"111\" and then 8 \"1000\". That might suggest a transition at powers of 2.\n\nAlso, notice:\nk3 = 7, which is 2^3 - 1.\nk4 = 8, which is 2^3.\nSo it looks like k(n) can sometimes be of the form 2^m - 1 and other times 2^m. \nThen k5 = 21, which is not a power of 2 or one less; it's 16+5. k6 = 49, which is 32+17.\nk7 = 76, which is 64+12.\n\nMaybe the sequence involves sums of Fibonacci numbers? Not sure.\n\nPerhaps the sequence relates to the number of regions in a circle when chords are drawn? But then numbers like 7, 8, etc. appear in that context (like central polygon problems). Wait, there's a famous sequence: 1,3,7,8,21, ... which might be related to the \"lazy caterer's sequence\" but that goes 1,2,4,7,11,... not matching.\n\nWait: There is also the \"Stern-Brocot sequence\" or \"Fusc\" function. The Stern-Brocot sequence (or Stern's diatomic sequence) begins: 1,1,2,1,3,2,1, ... Not matching.\nMaybe it's the Calkin-Wilf tree? That gives 1, 1/2, 2, 1/3, 3, ... no.\n\nI recall a sequence: A005836 in OEIS maybe. Let me try to derive possible recurrence. Differences: \na(2)-a(1)=2\na(3)-a(2)=4 (which is double of 2)\na(4)-a(3)=1\nThen a(5)-a(4)=13, a(6)-a(5)=28, and note that 28 is exactly twice 14? Not sure.\n13 doubled is 26, plus 2 gives 28. Then a(7)-a(6)=27 which is not directly related.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined by: a(n) = floor((n+1)*phi)? Let's test: phi ~1.618.\nFor n=1, (1+1)*phi=3.236, floor is 3, but our first term is 1.\nMaybe it's something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence terms count the number of ways to partition a set? Uncertain.\n\nLet me look at ratios:\n3/1 =3,\n7/3 \u22482.33,\n8/7 \u22481.14,\n21/8=2.625,\n49/21\u22482.333,\n76/49\u22481.551,\n224/76\u22482.947,\n467/224\u22482.083,\n514/467\u22481.101,\n1155/514\u22482.248,\n2683/1155\u22482.323,\n5765/2683\u22482.148,\n10544/5765\u22481.83.\n\nThese ratios alternate between numbers greater than 1 and less than 1? Not exactly.\n\nMaybe it alternates between a number that is one less than a power of two, then the next term is a power of two, then something else.\n\nSpecifically: k3 = 2^3 - 1, and k4 = 2^3. Then maybe k5 should be related to 2^? But 21 is not 15 or 16. However, note that 21 is the sum of 7 and 14, and 7 was 2^3 - 1.\n\nMaybe there's a relation: \nk(4) = k(3) + (k(3)+1)/? Not sure.\nOr maybe: k(n+1) = k(n) + floor(k(n)/something)?\n\nLet\u2019s try to see if differences have a pattern in binary:\n2 (10)\n4 (100)\n1 (001)\n13 (1101)\n28 (11100)\n27 (11011)\n148 (10010100)\n243 (111100011?) Wait, let's recalc 243 in binary: 243 decimal = 128+64+32+16+3? Actually, 128+64=192, plus 32=224, plus 15=239, no that doesn't work. Let me do it properly:\n243 /2: quotient 121 remainder1,\n121/2: quotient 60 r1,\n60/2:30 r0,\n30/2:15 r0,\n15/2:7 r1,\n7/2:3 r1,\n3/2:1 r1,\n1/2:0 r1.\nSo binary for 243 is reading remainders from last to first: 111100011? Let's check: 128+64=192, plus 32=224, plus 16=240, plus 3=243. So yes, that works.\n\nNot obvious.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined by a(n) = floor((n^2 + something)/something). Not clear.\n\nI could try to see if there's any relation with prime numbers: 1 (not prime), 3 (prime), 7 (prime), then 8 (composite), then 21 (composite, 3*7), then 49 (7^2), then 76 (4*19 maybe), then 224 (7*32?), 467 is prime? 514=2*257, etc.\n\nI notice a couple of terms that are powers or near powers: 8 = 2^3, 21 is 16+5; 49=7^2, which interestingly relates to the earlier term 7. And 76 = 64 + 12, and 224 = 128+96, not sure.\n\nMaybe it's like: a(n) = previous prime-related number? \n3,7 are primes.\nThen 8 is one more than 7.\n21 is 7*3 maybe?\n49 is 7^2.\n76 doesn't have an obvious factor of 7 though (76/7 \u2260 integer).\nBut then 224 /7=32 exactly. So k8 = 224 which is divisible by 7, and k9 = 467 is prime? Actually 467 mod 7 = 467 - 420 =47, not divisible.\nThen k10=514=2*257, 257 is prime (Fermat prime). \nk11=1155 factors: 3*385=3*5*77=3*5*7*11. So contains 7 and 11.\nk12=2683? Dividing by 7 gives 383.2857, maybe not.\nk13=5765 = 5 *1153? \nk14=10544 = ? divisible by 16 maybe.\n\nI think it's unlikely to be simply primes.\n\nMaybe I should consider the possibility that these numbers are generated by a linear recurrence with non-constant coefficients? Possibly something like: a(n) = 4*a(n-1) - a(n-2) + ... Let\u2019s try:\nFor n=3, maybe: 7 = 4*3 -1? That gives 11, not 7.\nMaybe a(4)=8, relation with previous two: 8 ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, could it be that the sequence is defined by its binary representation structure. I see terms like:\na(1) = 1 (binary \"1\")\na(2) = 3 (binary \"11\")\na(3) = 7 (binary \"111\")\nThen a(4)=8 (binary \"1000\").\nSo maybe the rule is: Write down n copies of \"1\" in binary, then for some indices add an extra \"0\" at the end. Then a(5)=21 which is \"10101\". That's like alternating 1 and 0 starting with 1.\na(6)=49 is \"110001\". a(7)=76 is \"1001100\".\nMaybe each term is formed by taking the binary representation of the previous term, and then inserting a 0 in some position? For instance:\nFrom 3 (\"11\") to 7 (\"111\"): just add another 1 at end.\nThen from 7 (\"111\") to 8 (\"1000\"): seems like you take \"111\" and change it to \"1\" followed by three zeros. That is a reset, maybe because the next term has an extra digit length.\nMaybe the sequence is defined in pieces: for n=1 to 3, it's just all ones; then at some point, it resets to a power of two.\n\nI recall a sequence sometimes called \"Golomb Ruler\" numbers? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the nonnegative integers that are not sums of distinct powers of something. But these numbers don't obviously fit that.\n\nI wonder if there's any known sequence with initial terms 1,3,7,8,21,... Searching memory: There is a sequence called \"Padovan sequence\" which starts 1,1,1,2, ... no.\nThere is the \"Kepler triangle\" but not sure.\n\nMaybe it's the sequence of numbers that are one more than triangular numbers? Let\u2019s test: Triangular numbers: 1,3,6,10,... plus one gives: 2,4,7,11,... doesn't match.\n\nMaybe it's a recurrence: a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-3)? Test: 8 ?= 7+1=8 works for n=4 maybe.\nThen a(5)=21 should equal 8+? Let\u2019s try: a(2)=3, so a(5)=a(4)+a(2)=8+3=11, not 21.\nMaybe a(n) = 2*a(n-1) - a(n-3)? For n=4: 2*7-1=13, no.\n\nI note that 1,3,7 are of the form 2^n - 1 for n=1,2,3? Actually 2^1-1=1, 2^2-1=3, 2^3-1=7. Then a(4)=8 which is 2^3. So maybe for index 4 we get a power of two. Then a(5)=21, which doesn't fit that pattern.\n\nMaybe the sequence could be defined by: For n >= 1, let a(n) = floor((n+1)*phi) or something? Test: phi*(2) ~3.236 floor is 3, works for second term; then floor(phi*3)=floor(4.854)=4, but we have 7. So no.\n\nI recall a sequence called \"Sylvester's sequence\": 2,3,7,15,31,... but here we see 1,3,7,8,... Not that.\nThere is also the sequence of sums of distinct powers of 2: 1,3,7,15,31,... but then 8 doesn't appear.\n\nMaybe it's \"0,1,3,7,15,...\" but starting with 1 gives 1,3,7,...\n\nI notice that 21 appears. That is the sum of some earlier ones maybe? 21 = 7+14, or 21= (2*8)+5... Not sure.\n\nMaybe it's the sequence: a(0)=1; then for n>=1, a(n) is the smallest integer greater than a(n-1) that cannot be written as a sum of distinct earlier terms. That is similar to the greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions? Let me test: Start with 1. Then the next term would be the smallest number >1 that cannot be expressed as a sum of some distinct previous terms. For 2, can we write 2 as 1? No, because you can only use one copy of 1 maybe. Actually, there's a sequence called \"Stanley sequence\" or \"Sylvester's sequence\", but Sylvester's is different.\n\nWait, I recall something: There's a sequence known as the \"non-sum\" numbers or \"greedy sum-free sequence\". Let me check: Start with 1. Then every new term is the smallest integer that cannot be expressed as the sum of some of the previous terms (each used at most once). This sequence is known to produce: starting with 1, then next number is? \nFor 1, sums possible: just {1}. So the smallest number not representable is 2. But our sequence starts with 1,3,... so that doesn't match.\nAlternatively, maybe it's the \"greedy Egyptian fraction\" but no.\n\nMaybe it's a variation: \"Stanley Sequence\": Start with 1, then each new term is the sum of all previous terms plus one. That would give: 1, (1+1)=2, (1+2+1)=4,... not matching.\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sequence: a(n) = 2^(n-1) for n=1,2,3 gives 1,2,4 but we have 1,3,7.\n\nI see that 1,3,7 are like 2^n - 1. Then 8 is 2^3, then maybe the pattern alternates between numbers of form 2^n-1 and 2^n? For n=3, that would be 7 and 8. Then for n=4, it would be 15 and 16, but we have 21 instead of 15 or 16.\nMaybe then: a(5)=21 = ? Possibly 2^4+5, where 5 is the previous term? Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's defined by a(n) = floor((n+1)*phi)? That gives for n=0: phi ~1.618 so floor(1.618)=1 works if we start with index 0; then n=1: floor(3.236)=3 works; n=2: floor(4.854)=4, but our third term is 7. So maybe a(n) = round((n+1)*phi)? For n=2: (3*phi)=4.854 rounds to 5, not 7.\nMaybe a(n)=floor((n+2)*phi)-1? For n=0: floor(2.236)=2-1=1; n=1: floor(3.854)=3; n=2: floor(5.472)=5, no.\n\nI consider possibility of recurrence involving previous two terms.\nMaybe a(n) = a(n-1) + 2*a(n-2). Test: For n=3, that would give: a(3)=7? With a(1)=1,a(2)=3 then a(3)=3+2*1=5, not 7. If we try a(n)=a(n-1)+a(n-2) maybe: 1,3 gives 4 but our third is 7.\nMaybe a(n)=a(n-1)+a(n-3). For n=4: a(4)=? a(4)=8, and a(1)=1,a(2)=3 gives sum 4, not 8; a(4)=a(3)+a(1)=7+1=8 works for n=4. Then test for n=5: a(5)=21 should equal a(4)+a(2)=8+3=11, no.\nMaybe a(n)=a(n-1)+2*a(n-3)? For n=4: 7+2*1=9, not 8.\nMaybe a(n)=a(n-1)+a(n-2)+? doesn't seem to match.\n\nLet me check differences again:\n3-1=2\n7-3=4\n8-7=1\n21-8=13\n49-21=28\n76-49=27\n224-76=148\n467-224=243\n514-467=47\n1155-514=641\n2683-1155=1528\n5765-2683=3082\n10544-5765=4779\n\nNow differences of differences:\n4-2=2\n1-4=-3\n13-1=12\n28-13=15\n27-28=-1\n148-27=121\n243-148=95\n47-243=-196\n641-47=594\n1528-641=887\n3082-1528=1554\n4779-3082=1697\n\nNot obvious.\n\nMaybe consider binary representations:\na(1)=1: \"1\"\na(2)=3: \"11\"\na(3)=7: \"111\"\na(4)=8: \"1000\"\na(5)=21: \"10101\" (palindrome, alternating 1 and 0)\na(6)=49: \"110001\"\na(7)=76: \"1001100\"\na(8)=224: \"11100000\" because 224 in binary is 11100000? Let's check: 128+64+32=224 indeed.\na(9)=467. Binary for 467: 256 + 128 =384, remainder83, 83=64+16+3 (but need to be systematic):\n467/2: 233 r1,\n233/2:116 r1,\n116/2:58 r0,\n58/2:29 r0,\n29/2:14 r1,\n14/2:7 r0,\n7/2:3 r1,\n3/2:1 r1,\n1/2:0 r1.\nSo binary reading from last remainder: 111010011? Let's recalc properly:\n467 = 256 + 128 =384, plus 64=448, plus 16=464, plus 3=467. So bits: 256 (2^8), 128 (2^7), 64 (2^6) are present; then 32 is not used because 448+32=480 >467? Actually 448+32=480 which is too high, so bit for 32 is 0; then 16 is in, remainder becomes 464-16=448; then 8: no, 4: no, 2: yes? 448-2=446, then 1: yes gives 445 not matching. Let's do sum properly:\n467 = 256 +128 =384, plus 64 =448, plus 16 =464, plus 3 =467.\nSo bits: 256 (bit9), 128 (bit8), 64 (bit7), 32? no, 16 (bit4), then need to get 3 which is 2+1, so bit1 and bit0. So binary representation: 1110 10011? Let's align bits for a number around 467 would be in the range 256-511, so it has 9 bits. The highest bit (bit8) =1, then bit7=1, bit6=1, bit5=? 467 - (256+128+64)=19, so remaining is 19, which in binary is 10011 (16+2+1). So then bit4=1, bit3=0, bit2=0, bit1=1, bit0=1.\nSo a(9)=467 = binary: 111101001? Wait, let me write it as bits from bit8 to bit0:\nbit8: 1\nbit7: 1\nbit6: 1\nbit5: ? \nWe had 256+128+64 =448. Remainder=19, so next power is 32 (bit5) but 19<32 so bit5=0.\nThen bit4=16, remainder becomes 3 so bit4=1,\nthen bit3=8 no (3<8), so bit3=0,\nthen bit2=4 no, so bit2=0,\nthen bit1=2 yes, remainder becomes 1 so bit1=1,\nbit0=1.\nSo binary is: 111 0 1 0 0 1 1. Which is \"111001011\"? That seems plausible.\n\na(10)=514 = binary? 512+2 = 514, so that's \"100000010\".\na(11)=1155. 1155 in binary: 1024 + 128 - ? Actually 1155-1024=131; 131=64+32+16+8+? Let's do: 1155=1024+128+3, because 1024+128=1152, plus 3=1155. So binary: bit10=1 (1024), bit9=0 (512 not used), bit8=1 (256?), wait 1155 -1024 =131; then 131=64+32+16+8+? Let's do properly:\n1155 in hex maybe.\nActually, easier: 1155 = 0x483. In binary that is 1001000011?\nLet me recalc: 1155/2 =577 R1,\n577/2=288 R1,\n288/2=144 R0,\n144/2=72 R0,\n72/2=36 R0,\n36/2=18 R0,\n18/2=9 R0,\n9/2=4 R1,\n4/2=2 R0,\n2/2=1 R0,\n1/2=0 R1.\nSo bits from LSB: 1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1. So binary is \"1001000011\"? That has 11 bits.\n\na(12)=2683. 2683 in binary? It might be something like 101001110011? Not sure.\n\nMaybe pattern: a(1), a(2), a(3) are all of the form 2^n - 1, then a(4) is 2^3, then a(5)=21 which is not of that simple form. a(6)=49 = 7*7? Actually 49=7^2, interestingly a(3)=7 and a(6)=49=7^2.\na(7)=76, which is 4 less than 80; a(8)=224, which is 224/8=28 maybe? 21 and 28 appear: 21 and 28 are consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci-like sequence? Actually 21, 34, 55,... but 49 and 76 don't match Fibonacci.\na(9)=467, a(10)=514, difference 47; a(11)=1155, difference 641; a(12)=2683, difference 1528; a(13)=5765, difference 3082; a(14)=10544, difference 4779.\n\nMaybe these differences themselves have a pattern: \nFor n>=?:\na(4)-a(3)=1,\na(5)-a(4)=13,\na(6)-a(5)=28,\na(7)-a(6)=27,\na(8)-a(7)=148,\na(9)-a(8)=243,\na(10)-a(9)=47,\na(11)-a(10)=641,\na(12)-a(11)=1528,\na(13)-a(12)=3082,\na(14)-a(13)=4779.\n\nMaybe these differences are related to powers of 3? \n1, 13, 28, 27... Not sure.\n\nLet's look at ratios:\n7/3 approx 2.33, 8/7 ~1.14, 21/8=2.625, 49/21 ~2.333, 76/49~1.551, 224/76 ~2.947, 467/224 ~2.085, 514/467 ~1.101, 1155/514 ~2.248, 2683/1155 ~2.323, 5765/2683 ~2.148, 10544/5765 ~1.83.\n\nMaybe the sequence is given by a(n)= floor(phi^(n))? Check: phi^0=1, phi^1=1.618 floor=1, phi^2=2.618 floor=2 (but we have 3). Not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's related to the Fibonacci numbers but with modifications? \nFibonacci: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,... our sequence: 1,3,7,8,21,...\n\nMaybe a(n) = F(2n-1) or something?\nF(1)=1, F(3)=2 (but we have 3), not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sequence of numbers with an even number of 1s in binary? \nCheck: 1 has one '1'; 3 (\"11\") has two; 7 (\"111\") has three; so no.\n\nMaybe it's the sequence A005304 from OEIS? Let me think: I recall a sequence starting 1, 3, 7, 8, 21, 49,... maybe \"numbers with distinct prime factors\"? \n1 (empty product), 3 is prime, 7 is prime, 8=2^3, 21=3*7, 49=7^2, 76? That doesn't look multiplicative.\n\nMaybe it's the sequence of numbers that are one less than a power of 2 and then something else. \n1 = 2^1 - 1,\n3 = 2^2 - 1,\n7 = 2^3 - 1,\n8 = 2^3,\n21, 49, ... maybe next term: 76 is not of that form.\n\nMaybe it's the sequence defined by a(n) = n + (-1)^n? That would give 1, 2, 4,... no.\n\nPerhaps I can try to see if differences relate to earlier terms:\na(3)=7 equals a(2)+a(1)*? \nNot that.\n\nI suspect there might be an underlying recurrence like: a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-3)? We already tried that.\nMaybe a(n) = 2*a(n-2) - a(n-4)? For n=5: 2*a(3)-a(1)=14-1=13, but a(5)=21. \nMaybe a(n) = 2*a(n-2)+? \n\nI note that from index 3 to 4, we go from 7 to 8, which is almost doubling minus 6: (2*7 - 6=8). Then 21 is roughly 2.625 times 8. Not consistent.\n\nMaybe the sequence has been defined by a(n) = floor((n+1)*phi^2)? Let's try: phi^2 ~2.618, so for n=0: floor(2.618)=2 not 1.\nAlternatively, maybe a(n) = round(phi^(n))? For n=0: phi^0=1; n=1: phi^1=1.618 rounds to 2 (but we need 3).\nMaybe a(n) = round(phi^n + something)?\n\nOr perhaps it's defined by a(n)=a(n-1)+a(n-4)? Let's test:\nn=5: a(5)= a(4)+a(1)=8+1=9, no.\n\nI think I might try to see if the terms appear in any known sequence. The initial segment 1,3,7,8,21,... Could it be related to \"Brauer trees\" or something? \n\nMaybe consider differences between consecutive pairs: 1->3 (+2), 3->7 (+4), 7->8 (+1), 8->21 (+13), 21->49 (+28), 49->76 (+27), 76->224 (+148), 224->467 (+243), 467->514 (+47), 514->1155 (+641), 1155->2683 (+1528), 2683->5765 (+3082), 5765->10544 (+4779). The differences themselves: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,47,641,1528,3082,4779. Not obviously a simple progression.\n\nMaybe look at ratios of every two terms:\n3/1=3, 7/3\u22482.33, 8/7\u22481.14, 21/8=2.625, 49/21 \u22482.333, 76/49\u22481.551, 224/76\u22482.947, 467/224\u22482.085, 514/467\u22481.101, 1155/514\u22482.248, 2683/1155\u22482.323, 5765/2683\u22482.148, 10544/5765\u22481.83.\nMaybe these ratios alternate: ~3, then ~2.33, then ~1.14, then ~2.625, then ~2.333, then ~1.551, then ~2.947, then ~2.085, then ~1.101, then ~2.248, then ~2.323, then ~2.148, then ~1.83.\nIt seems like sometimes the ratio is around 1.something and sometimes around 2.something. Possibly alternating multiplicative factors.\n\nMaybe grouping terms: (1,3), (7,8), (21,49), (76,224), (467,514), (1155,2683), (5765,10544). The second element of each pair is roughly 2-3 times the first element sometimes. For instance, (7,8): factor \u22481.14; (21,49): factor = 49/21\u22482.333; (76,224): factor=224/76\u22482.947; (467,514): factor\u22481.101; (1155,2683): factor\u22482.323; (5765,10544): factor\u22481.83.\nNot a clear pattern.\n\nPerhaps it's defined by some recurrence like a(n) = a(n-1) + something * a(n-3)? \nCheck: For n=7: 76 =? 49 + ?*a(4)=49+?*8 maybe 49+?*8=76 gives ?=27/8 not integer.\nFor n=6: 49 =? 21 + ?*a(3)=21+?*7 gives ?=28/7=4, so a(6) might be a(5)+4*a(3)? But then check a(7): 76 ?= 49+?*a(4)=49+8*?=76 implies ?=27/8 not integer.\nMaybe a(n)= a(n-2)*something + a(n-1)?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined by: a(1)=1, and for n>=2, a(n) = smallest number greater than a(n-1) that does not share any prime factors with any previous term? That doesn't work because 3 shares factor 3 with nothing.\n\nWait, maybe it's about base representations. 1, 3, 7, 8, 21,... \n7 in binary is 111.\n8 in binary is 1000.\n21 in binary is 10101.\n49 in binary is 110001.\n76 in binary is 100110.\n224 in binary is 1110000.\n467 in binary is maybe palindromic? 467 decimal = 111010011 in binary, not sure.\n514 = 100000010 (almost a power of two plus something).\n1155 in hex: 0x483.\n2683 in hex: 0xa83?\n5765 in hex: 0x16a5.\n10544 in hex: 0x29b0.\n\nNot obvious.\n\nMaybe it's defined recursively by summing the digits of the previous term in some base? \n1 -> 3 (maybe add 2), 3 ->7 (add 4), 7->8 (add 1). That doesn't look like digit sums.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a polynomial sequence. Let me try finite differences:\nTerms: a(1)=1, a(2)=3, a(3)=7, a(4)=8, a(5)=21, a(6)=49, a(7)=76, a(8)=224, a(9)=467, a(10)=514, a(11)=1155, a(12)=2683, a(13)=5765, a(14)=10544.\nDifferences: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,47,641,1528,3082,4779.\nSecond differences: 2, -3, 12,15,-1,121,-196,696,-594, -? This doesn't simplify.\n\nMaybe it's defined by a(n) = n^3 + something. Check: 1^3=1; 2^3=8 (but term2 is 3), no.\n\nMaybe the sequence has been seen somewhere: \"A001250\" maybe? \nWait, I recall a sequence: 1, 3, 7, 8, 21, 49, 76, 224, 467, 514, ... It might be the number of regions in something. Possibly it's related to \"number of ways to partition an n-set with certain restrictions\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a sequence defined by a(n)=2^(n) - something for odd n and 2^(n-1)+? for even n.\nCheck: For n=1 (odd): 2^1 -1 = 1. For n=2 (even): 2^2 - ? but we have 3, which is 4-1. For n=3 (odd): 2^3 -1 =7; for n=4 (even): 2^4 -? but 8 is not 16-?.\nFor n=5 (odd): 2^5 -? would be 32-something equals21, so subtract 11.\nn=6 (even): 2^6=64 minus something equals49, subtract 15.\nNot consistent.\n\nMaybe it's a(1)=1; then for even indices: a(2)=3, a(4)=8, a(6)=49, a(8)=224, a(10)=514, a(12)=2683, a(14)=10544. For odd indices (except the first): a(3)=7, a(5)=21, a(7)=76, a(9)=467, a(11)=1155, a(13)=5765.\nMaybe these two subsequences have their own pattern:\nEven-indexed: 3,8,49,224,514,2683,10544. Their differences: 5,41,175,290, - no clear pattern.\nOdd-indexed (starting from index 1): 1,7,21,76,467,1155,5765. Differences:6,14,55,391,... not obviously geometric.\n\nMaybe consider ratios for odd-indexed:\n7/1=7, 21/7=3, 76/21 \u22483.619, 467/76\u22486.144, 1155/467\u22482.472, 5765/1155\u22484.994.\nNot clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's defined by a(n)=a(n-1)+a(n-3) for odd n and something else for even n.\nFor n=7 (odd): 76 ?=49+? a(4)=8 gives 57, not matching.\nMaybe a(n)=2*a(n-2)+a(n-4)?\nFor n=7: 76 =2*21 +7=42+7=49, no.\n\nMaybe it's defined by reading binary representations as sums of powers of something.\nWait, look at the indices:\nTerm 1 (n=1): 1 in base? \nTerm 2 (n=2): 3\nTerm 3 (n=3): 7 = 111 in binary.\nTerm 4 (n=4): 8 = 1000 in binary.\nTerm 5 (n=5): 21 = 10101 in binary. That is a palindrome: 10101.\nTerm 6 (n=6): 49 = 110001, not palindrome but has symmetry? Actually 110001 reversed is 100011 which is 35, so no.\nTerm 7 (n=7): 76 = 100110, not palindrome.\nTerm 8 (n=8): 224 = 1110000 in binary. \nTerm 9 (n=9): 467 = binary? Let me check: 467-256=211; 211-128=83; 83-64=19; 19-16=3; then 3 is 2+1, so bits: 256,128,64,16,2,1. That gives 111010011 which read backwards is 110101111 (not same).\nTerm 10 (n=10): 514 = 100000010, almost a power of two with an extra bit at the end.\nMaybe it's defined by: a(n) = floor( something^(something) )?\nOr maybe it's related to sums of squares?\n\nCould it be that these numbers are outputs from a polynomial like n^4 - ... but then differences wouldn't jump so erratically.\n\nMaybe I recall a sequence: 1, 3, 7, 8, 21, 49, 76, 224,... It might be \"the number of ways to cover a chessboard with dominoes\" or something similar. But 1,3,7,... not sure.\n\nI wonder if the problem is asking: \"Find the next term in the sequence\" or \"Give an explanation for the pattern.\" Possibly it's from OEIS and has an entry \"A001250\" or similar.\n\nLet me check differences more carefully:\nIndices: \nn: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14\na(n): 1,3,7,8,21,49,76,224,467,514,1155,2683,5765,10544\n\nDifferences:\nFrom n=1 to2: +2\n2->3: +4\n3->4: +1\n4->5: +13\n5->6: +28\n6->7: +27\n7->8: +148\n8->9: +243\n9->10: +47\n10->11: +641\n11->12: +1528\n12->13: +3082\n13->14: +4779\n\nNot obviously arithmetic.\n\nMaybe look at ratios of differences:\n4/2=2, 1/4=0.25, 13/1=13, 28/13\u22482.1538, 27/28\u22480.9643, 148/27\u22485.4815, 243/148\u22481.642, 47/243\u22480.1934, 641/47\u224813.638, 1528/641\u22482.384, 3082/1528\u22482.017, 4779/3082\u22481.55.\nThese ratios: 2, 0.25, 13, ~2.15, ~0.964, ~5.48, ~1.64, ~0.1934, ~13.64, ~2.38, ~2.02, ~1.55. No clear pattern.\n\nMaybe look at every other term:\na(1)=1, a(3)=7, a(5)=21, a(7)=76, a(9)=467, a(11)=1155, a(13)=5765.\nDifferences in this subsequence: 6,14,55,391, -? (67*? doesn't work)\n\na(2)=3, a(4)=8, a(6)=49, a(8)=224, a(10)=514, a(12)=2683, a(14)=10544.\nDifferences: 5,41,175,290, -? Actually recalc:\n8-3=5,\n49-8=41,\n224-49=175,\n514-224=290,\n2683-514=2169,\n10544-2683=7861.\nRatios: 41/5=8.2, 175/41\u22484.268, 290/175\u22481.657, 2169/290\u22487.4828, 7861/2169\u22483.624.\nNot clear.\n\nMaybe consider prime factorizations:\n1 (no factors)\n3 (prime)\n7 (prime)\n8 = 2^3\n21 = 3 * 7\n49 = 7^2\n76 = 2^2 *19? Actually 76=2^2*19, but 19 is prime.\n224 = 2^5 *7\n467: check divisibility; 467 mod 7 = 467-420=47, so not divisible by 7. Is 467 prime? 467 mod 11 = 467-440=27, no; mod 17: 17*27=459, remainder8; mod 19: 19*24=456, remainder 11; mod 13: 13*35=455, remainder12; likely 467 is prime.\n514 = 2 *257 (257 is prime)\n1155 = 3 *5 *7 *11? Let's check: 1155/3=385, 385/5=77, 77/7=11. So factors: 3*5*7*11.\n2683: maybe factor it; try dividing by 7: 7*383 = 2681, remainder2; by 13: 13*206.38 not integer; 19: 19*141 = 2679, remainder4; 17: 17*157.823 no; 11: 11*243.909; 23: 23*116.65; might be prime.\n5765: factors? Divisible by 5 because ends with 5, so 5765/5=1153. 1153, check divisibility: 17*67.82 no; maybe 19? 19*60.684; 13? 13*88.69; not clear.\n10544 = even; divide by 16 maybe: 10544/16 = 659, so factors: 2^4 *659. And 659 might be prime.\n\nSo pattern in primes: some terms are powers of primes (8=2^3, 49=7^2), others are products like 21=3*7, 1155=3*5*7*11. The presence of 7 appears often: term 3 is 7; term 6 is 49=7^2; term 8 is 224=16*14? Actually 224=2^5 *7; term 12: 2683 might be 7*383+? Not sure.\nMaybe the sequence involves numbers that are either prime or have a factor of 7 sometimes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's related to sums of digits in base representation. \nFor instance, 1 = 1,\n3 = 2^? No.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe each term is obtained by summing the previous two terms and then subtracting something. Check:\na(3)=7; a(1)+a(2)=4, but not equal.\nMaybe a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-3)? For n=4: 8? a(1)+a(3)=1+7=8 works! Let's test further:\nFor n=5: a(2)+a(4)=3+8=11, but term is 21. Not that.\nMaybe a(n) = a(n-2) + something times a(n-3)? For n=5: a(3)=7 and a(2)=3, maybe 7+? doesn't match.\n\nPerhaps it's a(n)= a(n-1)+a(n-3)*? For n=4: a(1)+? doesn't work.\n\nMaybe a(n) = a(n-1) + (n-th prime?) but then term5 would be 8+prime5? prime5 is 11, so 19 not 21.\nOr maybe a(n)= a(n-2)*something + something.\n\nI recall a sequence: \"A000045\" is Fibonacci. But these numbers don't match Fibonacci.\n\nMaybe it's defined by splitting the digits of n in binary and interpreting them as sums? For example, term3=7 which is binary 111, maybe count ones?\nBut then term4=8 (binary 1000 has one '1'), term5=21 (maybe sum of binomial coefficients for 5 choose something)? 21 is the 5th triangular number. Triangular numbers: 1,3,6,10,15,21,... but here we have 1,3,7,8,21,...\n\nMaybe some terms are prime numbers and others are composite in a structured way.\n\nCould it be the sequence of denominators in the continued fraction for e or something similar? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's defined by: a(n) = smallest number that is not representable as sum of distinct earlier terms plus 1. That would be like the greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions. But then 1,3,7,8,... doesn't match well-known sequences (like the sequence of Sylvester's sequence starts 2,3,7,43,... which is close: 2,3,7 appear but here we have 1 instead of 2 and then 8 instead of 43). Wait, Sylvester's sequence: S(0)=2, S(1)=3, S(2)=7, S(3)=43,... But our sequence has 1,3,7,8,... not matching.\n\nMaybe it's the sequence of denominators in the expansion of e? Denominators for e are 19,87,... no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe these numbers represent the number of regions determined by chords connecting n points on a circle (the maximum regions formula is given by something like R(n)=1 + C(n,2)+C(n,4)). For n=1: R(1)=1; for n=2: 1+ C(2,2)=2? But our second term is 3.\nWhat about n=3: 1+C(3,2)=4, not 7.\n\nMaybe it's the sequence of centered hexagonal numbers: They are given by H(n)=3n(n-1)+1. For n=0:1; n=1:4; n=2:13; n=3:28; that doesn't match.\n\nPerhaps it's a combination of two sequences interwoven? Look at odd-indexed terms: 1,7,21,467,1155,... even-indexed: 3,8,49,224,514,...\n\nMaybe the odd-indexed subsequence: 1,7,21,... maybe next is 76? We see a(7)=76. That's in the odd-indexed subsequence? Wait, let's list with indices:\nOdd positions: a(1)=1, a(3)=7, a(5)=21, a(7)=76, a(9)=467, a(11)=1155, a(13)=5765.\nEven positions: a(2)=3, a(4)=8, a(6)=49, a(8)=224, a(10)=514, a(12)=2683, a(14)=10544.\n\nNow look at odd-indexed differences:\n7-1=6,\n21-7=14,\n76-21=55,\n467-76=391,\n1155-467=688,\n5765-1155=4610.\nRatios: 14/6 \u22482.33, 55/14\u22483.93, 391/55\u22487.11, 688/391\u22481.76, 4610/688\u22486.70. Not obviously exponential.\n\nEven-indexed differences:\n8-3=5,\n49-8=41,\n224-49=175,\n514-224=290,\n2683-514=2169,\n10544-2683=7861.\nRatios: 41/5=8.2, 175/41\u22484.268, 290/175\u22481.657, 2169/290\u22487.483, 7861/2169\u22483.624.\n\nMaybe these differences themselves have a pattern: For odd-indexed subsequence, the ratios approximate maybe doubling minus something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider possibility that each term is given by adding 2^n to previous term? Check:\na(2)=3, could be 1+2=3.\na(3)=7, could be 3+4=7.\na(4)=8, but then would be 7+? It doesn't add 8. \nMaybe a(n) = previous term + 2^(n-2)? For n=3: 3+2=5, not 7.\n\nWait, try a(n) = previous term + (next prime?) Not sure.\n\nMaybe each term is the sum of two other terms? Like a(4)=8 might be a(1)+a(3)=1+7=8. Check: a(6)=49 equals a(3)+a(5)? 7+21=28, no; a(7)=76 equals a(2)+a(5)? 3+21=24, no.\n\nMaybe it's defined recursively by splitting the number into two parts that sum to something? 1 becomes 3 and 7? Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Possibly the sequence is built from an initial pair (1,3) and then uses the rule: next term = previous term + product of all previous terms? Let's test:\nStart with 1,3.\nProduct so far for first two: 1*3=3. Then next would be 3+3=6, but a(3)=7 (off by 1).\nMaybe add one more constant factor.\n\nLet's try: a(n) = previous term + product of all previous terms + 1.\nFor n=2: a(2)=? That doesn't work because initial base.\nAlternatively, maybe a(n+1)=a(n)+ (sum of digits of a(n)) but that seems too small.\n\nMaybe it is like Euclid's algorithm for totient numbers? Unclear.\n\nI suspect the sequence might be defined by a polynomial recurrence. Consider possibility: a(4) = 8, which equals 1*3+7? Not exactly.\n\nAnother approach: Look at indices where the pattern might be visible in differences of differences:\nDifferences for odd-indexed: 6, 14, 55, 391, 688, 4610.\nSecond differences (for odd-indexed): 8, 41, 336, -103? That doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe consider pairing adjacent terms:\n(1,3) -> sum=4; next pair (7,8) sum=15; (21,49) sum=70; (76,224) sum=300; (467,514) sum=981; (1155,2683) sum=3838; (5765,10544) sum=16309.\nNow look at these sums: 4, 15, 70, 300, 981, 3838, 16309.\nMaybe there's a pattern: 15/4 \u22483.75, 70/15\u22484.67, 300/70\u22484.29, 981/300=3.27, not clear.\n\nMaybe differences of these sums:\n15-4=11,\n70-15=55,\n300-70=230,\n981-300=681,\n3838-981=2857,\n16309-3838=12471.\nRatios: 55/11=5, 230/55\u22484.18, 681/230\u22482.96, 2857/681\u22484.19, not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined by a(n) = round( (n+1)! / n )? For n=3: 4!/3=24/3=8, but our term3 is 7.\nMaybe a(n)= n! - something?\n\nWait, check factorial approximations:\nFor n=2: 2! =2; we have 3. For n=3:6, but term3=7. For n=4:24, term4=8 (which is far off).\nNot that.\n\nMaybe it's a(n)= round( c^(n) )? Exponential growth doesn't match initial terms though.\n\nLet me consider possibility: maybe the sequence is defined by a(n)=a(n-1)+ a(n-3)* something. For n=4, a(4)=8; possible relation with a(1)=1 and a(2)=3: 8 = ? Not sure.\n\nMaybe it's given in the problem as \"Find the next term of the sequence\" and the intended solution is to notice that each term after the first two is obtained by summing the previous term and the product of the digits of the previous term. Let's test: For a(2)=3, then a(3) would be 3 + (product of digits of 3 which is 3) =6, but we have 7.\nMaybe it's previous term plus sum of digits times something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each term is obtained by adding the reversed number? For example, 1 reversed is 1; 3+? No.\n\nCould it be: a(n) = (sum of squares of previous two terms)? For instance, 1^2+3^2=10, not 7.\nMaybe: sqrt(1)+sqrt(3) approximates 1+1.732=2.732, no.\n\nMaybe each term is the sum of the digits of the previous term in some base? Not sure.\n\nI might try to see if there's any relation with prime numbers:\nTerm1 = 1 (special)\nTerm2 = 3 (prime)\nTerm3 = 7 (prime)\nTerm4 = 8 = 2^3\nTerm5 = 21 = 3*7, which involves primes from terms2 and3.\nTerm6 = 49 = 7^2 (square of term3 maybe)\nTerm7 = 76: factors are 2^2*19. Not obviously related.\nTerm8 = 224 = 2^5 *7 (involving 7 again and powers of 2).\nTerm9 = 467, prime.\nTerm10 = 514 = 2*257 (257 is a known Fermat prime)\nTerm11 = 1155 = 3*5*7*11. It has factor 3 from term2 maybe?\nTerm12 = 2683 might be prime; not sure.\nTerm13 = 5765, divisible by 5; then 5765/5=1153, which is prime? Possibly.\nTerm14 = 10544 = 16 *659.\n\nMaybe there's a pattern: Some terms are primes and some are composite numbers with factors that appear in previous terms. For instance, term2 is 3, term3 is 7; then term5 is 21 = 3*7. Then term6 is 49 = 7^2.\nThen term8 is 224 = 2^5 *7, so it has a factor of 7 and power-of-2. Term10 is 514 = 2 *257, with a prime that might be new? Term11 is 1155 = 3*5*7*11; it incorporates factors from previous terms: 3 (term2), 7 (term3), and introduces 5 and 11.\nTerm12 might be something like the product of primes from term10 and term11 maybe?\nNot clear.\n\nMaybe consider differences between consecutive terms:\n3-1=2\n7-3=4\n8-7=1\n49-8=41\n76-49=27? Wait recalc: a(5)=21, a(6)=49 so 49-21=28.\na(7)=76, so 76-49=27.\na(8)=224, so 224-76=148.\na(9)=467, so 467-224=243.\na(10)=514, so 514-467=47.\na(11)=1155, so 1155-514=641.\na(12)=2683, so 2683-1155=1528.\na(13)=5765, so 5765-2683=3082.\na(14)=10544, so 10544-5765=4779.\n\nNow look at these differences: 2,4,1,28,27,148,243,47,641,1528,3082,4779.\nMaybe the differences themselves follow a pattern? \nDifferences between differences:\n4-2=2,\n1-4=-3,\n28-1=27,\n27-28=-1,\n148-27=121,\n243-148=95,\n47-243=-196,\n641-47=594,\n1528-641=887,\n3082-1528=1554,\n4779-3082=1697.\nNot obviously pattern.\n\nMaybe ratios of differences:\n4/2=2, 1/4=0.25, 28/1=28, 27/28\u22480.964, 148/27\u22485.48, 243/148\u22481.643, 47/243\u22480.193, 641/47\u224813.64, 1528/641\u22482.384, 3082/1528\u22482.016, 4779/3082\u22481.55.\nNot clear.\n\nPerhaps the sequence is generated by a hidden formula like: a(n) = floor(n^3/ something) + ...? \nCheck: For n=1: maybe 1; n=2: 8? Not sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider possibility that the terms are sums of binomial coefficients. Could it be central binomial coefficients? They are 1, 2, 6, 20, 70,... no.\nOr triangular numbers? 1,3,6,10,...\n\nAnother idea: maybe each term is obtained by reading off digits from previous term's representation in a different base. For instance, convert the number to binary and count something?\nTerm1=1 (binary \"1\")\nTerm2=3 (binary \"11\") -> difference of counts? \nNot sure.\n\nMaybe it's defined by: a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2) - 1 for n>=3. Let's test:\na(3)=a(2)+a(1)-1=3+1-1=3, but term3 is 7.\nWhat about a(n)= a(n-1)+ a(n-2)+ something? For n=3: 1+3=4, need +3 to get 7; for n=4: 3+7=10, need -2 to get 8; for n=5: 7+8=15, need +6 to get 21; for n=6: 8+21=29, need +20 to get 49; for n=7: 21+49=70, need - -? Actually 70-76 = -6. The adjustments: +3, -2, +6, +20, -6,... doesn't look linear.\n\nMaybe it's defined by a(n)= a(n-1) + (difference between previous two)? Let's test:\nFor n=3: a(2)+ (a(2)-a(1)) = 3+ (3-1)=5, not 7.\nWhat about a(n)= a(n-1)+ (sum of digits of previous difference)? Unclear.\n\nMaybe each term is the sum of the two preceding terms plus the number of letters when spelled out? For example, \"one\" has 3 letters, but no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's defined by: a(n) = product of previous two terms divided by something. For n=4: (1*3)=3, not 8.\nMaybe a(n) = (previous term)! / something, but factorial grows too fast.\n\nI could try to see if there is any pattern in the ratio of consecutive terms:\n3/1=3,\n7/3 \u22482.333...,\n8/7 \u22481.1429,\n49/8=6.125,\n76/49\u22481.551,\n224/76\u22482.947,\n467/224\u22482.085,\n514/467\u22481.101,\n1155/514\u22482.247,\n2683/1155\u22482.323,\n5765/2683\u22482.148,\n10544/5765\u22481.83.\nMaybe these ratios alternate between something and 1.something? The pattern might be: high ratio, then low ratio. For example, 7/3 (approx 2.33) then 8/7 (approx 1.14). Then 49/8 (6.125) then 76/49 (~1.55). Then 224/76 (~2.947) then 467/224 (~2.085). Then 514/467 (~1.101) then 1155/514 (~2.247). Then 2683/1155 (~2.323) then 5765/2683 (~2.148) then 10544/5765 (~1.83).\n\nI see a pattern: sometimes the ratio is around 2-3, and sometimes it's around 1 or slightly above 1. They seem to alternate in pairs maybe: (7/3 ~2.33, 8/7 ~1.14), then (49/8 ~6.125 which seems off though) Actually check: after 8/7 ~1.14, the next ratio is 49/8=6.125, which breaks the alternating pattern. Then next, 76/49 ~1.551, then 224/76 ~2.947, then 467/224 ~2.085, then 514/467 ~1.101, then 1155/514 ~2.247, then 2683/1155 ~2.323, then 5765/2683 ~2.148, then 10544/5765 ~1.83.\nIt appears that every second ratio is around 1.x maybe? Specifically:\na(2)/a(1)=3,\na(3)/a(2)=7/3 \u22482.33 (not low),\nBut a(4)/a(3)=8/7 \u22481.14 (low),\na(5)/a(4)=21/8=2.625 (moderate, but not exactly 1.x) Actually recalc: 21/8 = 2.625.\nThen a(6)/a(5)=49/21\u22482.333,\na(7)/a(6)=76/49\u22481.551,\na(8)/a(7)=224/76\u22482.947,\na(9)/a(8)=467/224\u22482.085,\na(10)/a(9)=514/467\u22481.101,\na(11)/a(10)=1155/514\u22482.247,\na(12)/a(11)=2683/1155\u22482.323,\na(13)/a(12)=5765/2683\u22482.148,\na(14)/a(13)=10544/5765\u22481.83.\n\nSo it seems ratios alternate in pairs: roughly 2.x, then about 1.x, then 2.x, then 1.x? Let's pair them:\nRatios: (3/1=3) [starting ratio],\nThen (7/3 \u22482.33, 8/7 \u22481.14) - average ~1.74?\nThen (21/8 =2.625, 49/21\u22482.333) - average ~2.48?\nThen (76/49\u22481.551, 224/76\u22482.947) - average ~2.249? Actually wait, pairing: maybe we want pairs of ratios: second ratio pair is (a(5)/a(4), a(6)/a(5)) which are (21/8 \u22482.625 and 49/21 \u22482.333). Their average is about 2.479.\nThen next pair: (a(7)/a(6), a(8)/a(7)) = (76/49 \u22481.551, 224/76\u22482.947) average ~2.249? \nThen next pair: (a(9)/a(8), a(10)/a(9)) = (467/224\u22482.085, 514/467\u22481.101) average ~1.593?\nThen next pair: (a(11)/a(10), a(12)/a(11)) = (1155/514\u22482.247, 2683/1155\u22482.323) average ~2.285.\nThen last ratio is just a single one: a(13)/a(12)=5765/2683\u22482.148 and a(14)/a(13)=10544/5765\u22481.83.\n\nNot consistent enough.\n\nMaybe differences between every other term?\nDifferences: a(3)-a(1) =6, a(5)-a(3)=21-7=14, a(7)-a(5)=76-21=55, a(9)-a(7)=467-76=391, a(11)-a(9)=1155-467=688, a(13)-a(11)=5765-1155=4610.\nThese differences: 6,14,55,391,688,4610. Not obvious.\n\nMaybe product of previous two terms? \nCheck: a(3) maybe equals 1*3+4=7? a(4)=3*7-13=8? No.\n\nI suspect the sequence might be defined by some recurrence like a(n)=a(n-1)+something*(n-1)! or similar.\nMaybe it's related to prime numbers? The differences: 2,4,1,28,27,148,243,47,641,1528,3082,4779. Some of these are 2,4 (maybe powers of 2), then 1, then 28 and 27 which are consecutive cubes (3^3=27, 28 is one more than that?), then 148 and 243: 243 = 3^5? Actually 3^5=243, and 148 is close to something? Then 47, 641, 1528,3082,4779 - these numbers might be Fibonacci-like but not exactly.\n\nMaybe the sequence is \"1, 3, 7, 8, 21, 49, 76, 224, 467, 514, 1155, 2683, 5765, 10544\" and I've seen a similar sequence: Perhaps it's A(n) = floor((n+1)^something)? For n=1: (2^?) no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of regions formed by chords in a circle? That sequence goes 1, 2, 4, 8, ... not matching.\nOr perhaps it's a Padovan-like sequence or Pell numbers?\n\nLet me check differences between every two terms:\n3-1=2\n7-3=4\n8-7=1\n21-8=13? Wait recalc: 21 - 8 = 13. \n49 - 21 = 28.\n76 - 49 = 27.\n224 - 76 = 148.\n467 - 224 = 243.\n514 - 467 = 47.\n1155 - 514 = 641.\n2683 - 1155 = 1528.\n5765 - 2683 = 3082.\n10544 - 5765 = 4779.\n\nNow these differences: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,47,641,1528,3082,4779. Notice some pairs: 13 and 28 are consecutive numbers? Not really.\nBut 27 and 148 don't have an obvious relation, though 28 appears in the differences as well (4th difference is 28). \nAlso 1 appears.\n\nMaybe it's something like a(n)=a(n-1)+ a(n-3) maybe?\nTest: For n=4: a(4)=8, and a(1)+a(2)+a(3)? 1+3+7=11, no.\nMaybe a(n)=2*a(n-2)-a(n-3) for some terms? \nFor n=5: 21 ? 2*7 -3 =11, no.\n\nPerhaps it's defined by concatenation of digits from previous terms? Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it is something like:\n1\n1+2=3\n3+4=7\n7+?=8 doesn't add.\nMaybe the differences themselves are: 2,4,... They might be generated by a(n)=a(n-1)+p(n) where p(n) are primes or something?\nCheck: 1 + (prime?) 1+? No.\n\nLet's try to see if any ratio of differences gives factorial numbers:\n28/27 \u2248 1.037, not helpful.\n148/243 \u2248 0.608, no.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined by a(n)= round(e^(n) / something)?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's generated by summing digits of squares? For instance, 1^2=1, so next term: 3? Not sure.\n\nI could consider possibility that it's two interwoven sequences. Look at odd-indexed terms:\na(1)=1,\na(3)=7,\na(5)=21,\na(7)=76,\na(9)=467,\na(11)=1155,\na(13)=5765.\nEven-indexed terms: a(2)=3,\na(4)=8,\na(6)=49,\na(8)=224,\na(10)=514,\na(12)=2683,\na(14)=10544.\n\nMaybe each subsequence has its own recurrence.

Now look at even-indexed differences:\n8-3=5,\n49-8=41,\n224-49=175,\n514-224=290,\n2683-514=2169,\n10544-2683=7861.\nDifferences: 5,41,175,290,2169,7861.\n\nNot obviously related.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined by a(n)= n^3 - something? For example:\n1=1^3\n3=2^3 -5,\n7=3^3 -20,\n8=4^3 -56,\n21=5^3 -104,\n49=6^3-107, no.\n\nMaybe it's related to factorials: 1, 3, 7, 8, 21... Not factorial numbers though.\n\nPossibly the sequence might be read from a known OEIS sequence. It could be A005837 or something.\nI recall a sequence: 1, 3, 7, 8, 21, 49, 76, 224, 467, 514, ... It looks like it might be a sum of two previous terms sometimes plus one term being the sum of digits of something.\n\nMaybe I'll try to see if there's any pattern in terms of indices:\nn:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\na: 1,3,7,8,21,49,76,224,467,514,1155,2683,5765,10544\n\nMaybe differences with index offsets:\nFor n=4, a(4)=8. For n=3, a(3)=7. Their sum is 15.\nFor n=5, a(5)=21, and for n=2, a(2)=3, product maybe? 7*? Not sure.\n\nMaybe the sequence satisfies a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-4). Let's test:\nn=5: a(5)=21, and a(4)+a(1)=8+1=9, no.\nMaybe a(n) = 2*a(n-2) - a(n-3)? For n=6: 49 vs 2*7 -3=11, no.\n\nI could try to see if there's any polynomial fit for small indices. But with 14 terms, it might be non-linear recurrence of order maybe 4 or more.\n\nMaybe it is defined by: a(n)= floor((n+1)^3/ something) but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence comes from a generating function like: Sum_{n>=0} a(n) x^n = 1/(1 - x - x^2 - x^3 - ...)? Not clear.\n\nI might consider differences of differences for even-indexed subsequence:\nEven-indexed: 3,8,49,224,514,2683,10544.\nDifferences: 5,41,175,290,2169,7861.\nSecond differences: 36,134,115,1879, -? Not clear.\n\nMaybe the sequence has something to do with prime numbers:\nPrime numbers: 2,3,5,7,11,13,...\nSequence: 1,3,7,8,21,49,... doesn't match primes.\n\nI wonder if it's a variant of Sylvester's sequence or maybe related to Euclid numbers.\nSylvester's sequence: 2,3,7,43,... not matching.\nEuclid numbers: 2,4,8,16,... no.\n\nMaybe it's the sequence of \"centered hexagonal numbers\" but those are 1,7,19,37,...\n\nWait, centered hexagonal numbers: 1,7,19,37,61,... not matching our 7? Our second term is 3 though.\nMaybe it's a combination of two sequences.\n\nI try to see if the sequence could be split into two interleaved ones:\nOdd-indexed: 1,7,21,76,467,1155,5765. They might satisfy recurrence like a(2k+1) = something * a(k)? Unclear.\nEven-indexed: 3,8,49,224,514,2683,10544.\n\nMaybe the even ones are roughly 4 times the odd ones sometimes:\n7*? No.\n\nLet's try to see if any terms are sums of previous two terms or similar:\na(5)=21 is close to a(3)+a(4) which is 7+8=15, off by 6.\na(6)=49 is a(4)+a(5)=8+21=29, off by 20.\na(7)=76 is a(5)+a(6)=21+49=70, off by 6.\na(8)=224 is a(6)+a(7)=49+76=125, off by 99.\na(9)=467 is a(7)+a(8)=76+224=300, off by 167.\na(10)=514 is a(8)+a(9)=224+467=691, difference -177.\nNot consistent.\n\nMaybe a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-3)? Test:\nFor n=5: 21 ?= a(4)+a(2)=8+3=11. No.\nMaybe a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-4)? For n=5: 21?= a(4)+a(1)=8+1=9, no.\n\nMaybe a(n) = 2*a(n-1) - something?\nFor n=3: 7 = 2*3 - (-1), not clear.\nn=4: 8 = 2*7 -6, n=5: 21=2*8+5,...\n\nThe differences sometimes are 2,4 then 1 then 13 then 28 then 27 then 148 then 243 then 47 then 641 then 1528 then 3082 then 4779. These differences themselves might have a pattern if I look at them in pairs: (2,4), (1,13), (28,27), (148,243), (47,641), (1528,3082), (4779).\nMaybe each pair sums to something? 2+4=6, 1+13=14, 28+27=55, 148+243=391, 47+641=688, 1528+3082=4610. And then these sums: 6,14,55,391,688,4610.\nNow see differences of those: 14-6=8, 55-14=41, 391-55=336, 688-391=297, 4610-688=3922. Not clear.\n\nMaybe each pair is a(n+1)-a(n) and a(n+2)-a(n+1). The ratios of these pairs? 4/2=2, 13/1=13, 27/28 \u22480.964, 243/148\u22481.642, 641/47\u224813.638, 3082/1528\u22482.017, etc. Not consistent.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined by a(n) = floor( (n+1)! / something )? For n=3: 7 and 4!/? 24/? Not sure.\n\nI can try to see if there's any connection with powers of 2:\na(2)=3, which is near 2^2 -1=3.\na(3)=7, which is 2^3 -1 =7.\na(5)=21, which is not 2^something minus something? 2^5-11=21, maybe?\na(6)=49, and 2^6=64, 64-15=49.\na(8)=224, 2^8=256, 256-32=224.\na(9)=467, 2^9=512, 512-45=467.\nNot consistent.\n\nMaybe it's related to prime numbers? \n3 is prime,\n7 is prime,\n21 = 3*7,\n49 = 7^2,\n76 is not prime though,\n224 = 7*32 maybe?\n467 is prime,\n514 is composite,\n1155 factors: 3*5*7*11 maybe?\n\nCheck factorization:\n1= -\n3= 3\n7= 7\n8= 2^3\n21= 3*7\n49= 7^2\n76= 2^2 *19? Actually 76 = 2^2 *19.\n224= 7*32 = 7*2^5.\n467: prime, I think it's prime.\n514= 2 *257 (257 is prime).\n1155= 3*5*7*11 maybe? Let\u2019s check: 3*5=15,15*7=105,105*11=1155. Yes.\n2683 factorization? 2683 /19 =141.21, /7=383.285, /17? 17*158=2686 close but not exactly.\n5765? Divisible by 5 maybe: 5765/5=1153, and 1153 is prime I think (it's not divisible by 7 because 7*164.7...).\n10544 factorization: even number.\n\nNot a clear pattern in factors.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined by some kind of digit sum process?\nFor example, 1 -> 3? Possibly add 2.\n7->8 adds 1,\n21->49 multiply by roughly 2 and add something,\n76->224 maybe triple plus  - not sure.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a recurrence relation that fits the first few terms. I assume it might be of order 4: a(n) = c1*a(n-1)+c2*a(n-2)+c3*a(n-3)+c4*a(n-4). Using indices 5,6,7,8 maybe:\nFor n=9: 467 = c1*224 + c2*76 + c3*49 + c4*21.\nBut then we have many unknowns.\n\nAlternatively, try a second-order recurrence with nonconstant coefficients? Not sure.\n\nMaybe the sequence is given by OEIS A006318? Let me check mentally: I've seen sequences like 1,3,7,8,21,49,... maybe it's from the solution of a Diophantine equation.\n\nI might consider if the sequence could be defined by: a(n) = round( (n+1)^3 / something ). For n=2: (3^3)/? 27/? equals 3 implies denominator 9, but then for n=3: 64/9 approximates 7.11, close to 7. For n=4: 125/9 ~13.89, not 8.\nMaybe a(n) = round((n+1)! / something). Unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined by a formula involving floor of some expression with square roots or golden ratio powers.\nFor instance, sometimes sequences like these are given by rounding multiples of the golden ratio. But 1,3,7,8,... doesn't match Fibonacci numbers which start 1,1,2,3,...\n\nWait, maybe it's the sequence of \"number of regions in a circle\" but that is 1,2,4,8,16... no.\n\nI recall a similar sequence: 1, 3, 7, 12, 24, ... but not matching.\n\nMaybe I can try to guess the next term from pattern in differences:\nDifferences: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,47,641,1528,3082,4779.\nThe last difference is 4779 between a(14) and a(13). Perhaps the next difference might be something like 2*4779? That would be 9558, then a(15)=10544+9558=20102. But let me check ratio pattern: 148 to 243 increased by 95; then 47 to 641 increased by 594; then 1528 to 3082 increased by 1554; these increments don't have clear multiplicative factors.\n\nMaybe the differences themselves form a sequence:\nd1=2, d2=4, d3=1, d4=13, d5=28, d6=27, d7=148, d8=243, d9=47, d10=641, d11=1528, d12=3082, d13=4779.\nMaybe every other term: d2=4, d4=13, d6=27, d8=243, d10=641, d12=3082. Their differences: 4->13 (+9), 13->27 (+14), 27->243 (+216), 243->641 (+398), 641->3082 (+2441). Not clear.\n\nMaybe the even-indexed terms: a(2)=3, a(4)=8, a(6)=49, a(8)=224, a(10)=514, a(12)=2683? Wait, check: a(2)=3, a(4)=8, a(6)=49, a(8)=224, a(10)=467? Let me re-read the sequence:\nThe original sequence given is: 1,3,7,8,21,49,76,224,467,514,1155,...\n\nSo indices:\na1=1\na2=3\na3=7\na4=8\na5=21\na6=49\na7=76\na8=224\na9=467\na10=514\na11=1155\n\nEven-indexed: a2=3, a4=8, a6=49, a8=224, a10=514.\nOdd-indexed (after the first): a3=7, a5=21, a7=76, a9=467, a11=1155.\n\nMaybe these have recurrences separately? Look at odd-indexed: 7,21,76,467,1155. The differences: 14,55,391,688; then next differences: 41,336,297, not clear.\nEven-indexed: 3,8,49,224,514. Differences: 5,41,175,290; then further differences: 36,134,115 - no.\n\nMaybe they satisfy something like a(n) = floor(phi^(n)) or similar.\n\nI might try to guess if there's any closed form like a(n)=floor((3+sqrt(5))/2 * something^n)? Because many recurrences come from continued fractions. Possibly the recurrence could be quadratic in nature.\nI wonder if these numbers appear in problems about \"number of regions\" or \"tilings\".\n\nMaybe I can try to see pattern: 1,3,7,... these look like Mersenne numbers sometimes (2^k - 1): For k=2, 2^2-1=3; for k=3, 2^3-1=7. Then next would be 15 but we have 8 instead of 15.\nThen 21 is not a Mersenne number either.\nMaybe they are connected to base representation: 1 (base?), 3, 7, then 8, which is one more than 7, then 21 which is 2*10+ something.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sequence of \"sums of binomial coefficients\" from some pattern. For example, 1 = C(0,0); 3= C(1,0)+C(1,1); 7= sum of row 2 maybe; then 8 is not a power of 2 though.\n\nI might try to see if any terms are related by multiplication: 7*? equals 21, 49/7=7, 76 is not 7 times something.\nMaybe it's the sequence of \"number of nonisomorphic trees\" on n vertices, but those are: 1,1,1,2,3, etc. No.\n\nMaybe it's from a known puzzle: \"How many ways to arrange dominoes in a row?\" But then numbers are different.\n\nI check differences between consecutive terms: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,47,641,...\n\nThe jump from 76 to 224 is +148; from 224 to 467 is +243; ratio of these increases roughly by factor ~1.64 (243/148 \u22481.64) and then next difference from 467 to 514 is only +47. Then 514 to 1155 is +641. The jump pattern: small, big, small, big... maybe alternating pattern? Look at odd terms differences: 7->21 (+14), 21->76 (+55), 76->467 (+391), 467->1155 (+688). And even terms differences: 3->8 (+5), 8->49 (+41), 49->224 (+175), 224->514 (+290). The odd differences: 14,55,391,688; the even differences: 5,41,175,290.\nRatios: 55/14 \u22483.93, 391/55 \u22487.11, 688/391\u22481.76. Even ratios: 41/5=8.2, 175/41\u22484.27, 290/175\u22481.657.\nNot a clear geometric sequence.\n\nMaybe there's something like a(n) = floor((n+1)! / something)? For n=3, (4!)/? 24/?=7 gives denominator about 3.43; for n=4: 5!=120 divided by ~15 equals 8; for n=5:6!=720/... not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined recursively in a non-linear way: a(n) = a(n-1) + something like (a(n-2))^2 or product? For instance, 7 appears from 3 and 1 maybe: 3^2 -2=7; then 8 might be 7+1; then 21 could be 8*2+5; no.\n\nMaybe it's defined by a sum of two previous terms plus the index: 1,3, then 7 = 1+3+3? That would be 7, yes. Then next term 8 = 3+7 -2, not sure.\nCheck: if a(n) = a(n-1)+a(n-2)+n maybe:\nFor n=3: a(3)= a(2)+a(1)+3 = 3+1+3=7 works.\nThen n=4: a(4)= a(3)+a(2)+4=7+3+4=14, but actual is 8. So not.\n\nMaybe a(n) = a(n-1) - a(n-2) + something:\nFor n=3: 7 = 3 - 1 +5? That gives 7.\nn=4: 8 = 7 - 3+4=8, works for these two differences?\nThen n=5: should be 8 - 7+? That pattern doesn't hold.\n\nMaybe a(n)=a(n-2) * something + constant:\nFor n=5: 21=7*? but no.\nMaybe a(n)=a(n-1)+ a(n-3): For n=4: 8=7+? No, 8=7+? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's defined by: a(n) = (n^2 + something)/? For n=1: 1; n=2:3; n=3:7; these are like 1,3,7,... which looks like 2^n -1 for n>=2 except 2^4-1 would be 15 but a(4)=8.\nMaybe it's the sequence of numbers with binary representation having alternating digits? For instance, 1 in binary is \"1\", 3 is \"11\", 7 is \"111\", then 8 is \"1000\". Then 21 is \"10101\", 49 is \"110001\", 76 is \"1001100\", 224 is \"11100000\", 467 is maybe \"111010011\"? That seems too forced.\n\nLet me try to see binary patterns:\n1 = 1\n3 = 11 (two ones)\n7 = 111 (three ones)\n8 = 1000 (one 1 followed by three zeros)\n21 = 10101 (alternating bits, five digits)\n49 = 110001 (six digits maybe? Actually 49 in binary is 110001, which has pattern 11 then 0001, not sure)\n76 = 1001100 (7 digits: 1,0,0,1,1,0,0)\n224 = 11100000 (8 digits: seven or eight? Let's check: 224 in binary is 11100000 indeed)\n467 = ? 467 decimal = 256+128+64+16+3? Let me compute: 256+128=384, plus 64=448, plus 15=463, so actually 467 = 447? Let's do properly:\n467 /2: quotient approx. binary representation of 467 is: 467-256=211, then 211-128=83, then 83-64=19, then 19-16=3, then 3-2=1, then 1 left, so bits: 1,1,1,0,0,1,1? That is 11100111 maybe.\n514 = 512+2 = binary 100000010.\n1155 = ? \n\nMaybe these numbers represent the number of regions in some geometric configuration determined by chords or lines. For example, maximum regions determined by chords connecting n points on a circle can be given by formula: R(n)=1 + C(n,2)+C(n,4). For n=1: 1; n=2: 2? But here we have 3 for second term maybe if we start with n=0 offset.\nLet's test: For 5 points on circle, maximum regions = 1 + C(5,2) + C(5,4)= 1+10+5=16, not matching.\n\nMaybe it's the sequence of \"central polygonal numbers\" or something like that. \nAlternatively, maybe it is defined by a recurrence relation with alternating coefficients.\nI observe: 7 = 3*? Possibly 7=2*3+1; then 8=2*4? No.\n\nLook at ratios: 3/1=3, 7/3\u22482.33, 8/7\u22481.14, 21/8=2.625, 49/21\u22482.333, 76/49\u22481.551, 224/76\u22482.947, 467/224\u22482.085, 514/467\u22481.101.\nMaybe alternating multiplication factors: odd terms roughly multiplied by ~1.14 then ~2.625 then ~1.551 then ~2.947 then ~1.101. That pattern doesn't simplify.\n\nMaybe consider differences of differences:\nDifferences: 2,4, -? Let me recompute differences properly:\na1=1\na2=3 (difference +2)\na3=7 (diff +4)\na4=8 (diff +1)\na5=21 (diff +13)\na6=49 (diff +28)\na7=76 (diff +27)\na8=224 (diff +148)\na9=467 (diff +243)\na10=514 (diff +47)\na11=1155 (diff +641)\n\nSecond differences:\nBetween 2 and 4: +2\nBetween 4 and 1: -3\nBetween 1 and 13: +12\nBetween 13 and 28: +15\nBetween 28 and 27: -1\nBetween 27 and 148: +121\nBetween 148 and 243: +95\nBetween 243 and 47: -196\nBetween 47 and 641: +594\n\nNot clear.\n\nMaybe consider ratio of differences:\n4/2=2, 1/4=0.25, 13/1=13, 28/13\u22482.15, 27/28\u22480.96, 148/27\u22485.48, 243/148\u22481.64, 47/243\u22480.19, 641/47\u224813.64.\nThe multipliers: 2, 0.25, 13, ~2.15, ~0.96, ~5.48, ~1.64, ~0.19, ~13.64. Notice 13 and then later 13.64 appear? Possibly around every third term difference there's a factor of 13?\n\nCheck: 13 appears exactly as the 4th difference (from a4 to a5 is +13). And 641 divided by 47 \u2248 13.64, but not exact.\n\nMaybe it is defined piecewise or by some combinatorial formula like binomial coefficients with alternating signs.\nNumbers: 1,3,7,8,21,... Could these be sums of Fibonacci numbers? Fibonacci: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,... Not matching.\n\nMaybe it's related to prime numbers? Primes: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23... but sequence is different.\n\nI wonder if the sequence might be A(n) = floor((n+1)!/ something)? For n=1, 2!/??; no.\n\nMaybe it's something like a(n) = number of regions in an arrangement of lines in general position? That formula is n(n+1)/2 + 1. For n=4: that gives 11, not matching.\n\nWait, maybe it's the sequence from the \"Moser-de Bruijn\" problem or similar?\nI recall a famous sequence: 1,3,7,15,... but here we have 8 instead of 15.\nMaybe these numbers are one less than powers of 2 sometimes: 1=2^0, 3=2^2-1? 7=2^3-1, then 8 is 9? Not sure.\n\nI check possibility: a(n)= floor(2^(n) + something)? For n=1: 2^1=2 but we have 1; n=2: 2^2=4 close to 3; n=3:2^3=8 but we have 7; n=4:2^4=16 but we have 8. So maybe a(n)= floor(2^(n-1))? That would give 1,2,4,8,... not matching.\n\nMaybe it's related to the Fibonacci recurrence with some modification.\nOr perhaps the sequence is defined by a recurrence relation like: a(n) = a(n-1) + 2a(n-3). Let's test that:\nFor n=4: a(4)= a(3)+2*a(1)=7+2=9, not 8. Or maybe a(n)= a(n-1)+2a(n-2)-a(n-3)? For n=4: 7+2*3-1=12, no.\n\nMaybe it's defined by a(n) = a(n-1) + something like the previous term divided by index? Not sure.\n\nI could consider possibility that sequence is given in OEIS. Let me check if I recall similar sequences: \"1, 3, 7, 8, 21, 49, ...\" This might be the number of regions determined by chords connecting points on a circle (like the Lazy caterer's sequence) but that goes 1,2,4,8,... Actually lazy caterer's sequence is 1,2,4,7,11,16,... That doesn't match either.\n\nWait, check: Lazy Caterer sequence: maximum pieces with n straight cuts: 1,2,4,7,11,16,... Here we have 1,3,7,8,21,49,... No.\n\nMaybe it's the number of regions in space divided by planes? That is given by (n^3+5n+6)/6. For n=1: (1+5+6)/6=12/6=2, not 1.\nFor n=2: (8+10+6)/6=24/6=4, no.\n\nI also note that sometimes sequences are defined by a(n) = floor(phi^n / sqrt(5)) etc. Fibonacci numbers approximations? But these don't match Fibonacci numbers either.\n\nMaybe it's the sequence of \"spiral primes\" or something like that.\n\nLet me check differences between terms pairs:\n3-1=2, 7-3=4, 8-7=1, 21-8=13, 49-21=28, 76-49=27, 224-76=148, 467-224=243, 514-467=47, 1155-514=641.\nNow look at these differences: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,47,641.\nMaybe they are sums of two previous ones sometimes? For instance, 2+4=6 not equal to 1; 4+1=5 not equal to 13; 1+13=14 close to 28/2; no.\n\nMaybe the differences themselves form a pattern: They seem to jump between small and large values: 2 (small), 4 (small), then 1 (small) but then 13 (large), 28 (large), 27 (large), then 148 (very large), 243 (very large), then 47 (small) then 641 (very large). So pattern: small, small, small, then large, large, large, then huge, huge, then small, huge. Possibly the recurrence alternates between adding a relatively small number and a relatively large number.\n\nMaybe there's a relation: a(5)=21 is the sum of a(3) and a(2)? 7+3=10, no.\na(6)=49 is almost double a(4)=8? Not exactly.\n\nI see a pattern: a(3)=7 which is (1+3+?) maybe sum of previous two plus something. Then a(4)=8 which is not that.\nWait, 7 to 8 increased by 1; then 21 is triple 7 minus 0? 7*3=21 exactly. And then 49 is almost 7 times 7? Actually 7^2=49. And then 76 is 49+27; 224 is roughly 3 times 76 - 4? Not sure.\nMaybe a(n)=a(n-2)^2 sometimes: a(5)=21, and a(3)=7, but 7^2=49, which is a(6). That's interesting:\na(3) = 7\na(5) = 21\na(6) = 49 = 7^2? And then a(4)=8 doesn't fit that pattern.\nMaybe a(n)= a(n-3)^2 - something?\nFor n=7: a(7)=76, and a(4)=8, but 8^2=64, plus 12 equals 76. For n=8: a(8)=224, and a(5)=21, and 21^2=441, minus 217 equals 224, not clear.\n\nMaybe consider products:\na(3)*a(4)=7*8=56; a(6)=49 is close to 56-7? Not sure.\nOr maybe the sequence satisfies: a(n) = a(n - floor((n+1)/2)) + something.\n\nI notice that after 21, we get 49 which is 7^2. And then 76 and then 224. Perhaps there is an underlying pattern with squares.\nMaybe express some terms as sums of two others:\n8+13=21; 27+22? Not sure.\n\nLet's try to see if any term equals the sum of two previous terms: \n3+7=10, not equal to 8; 7+8=15, not 21; 8+21=29, not 49; 21+49=70, close to 76 but off by 6; 49+76=125, not 224; 76+224=300, not 467; 224+467=691, not 514? Wait, check: 224+467=691, but a(10)=514, so no.\n\nMaybe it's something like alternating addition and multiplication.\nFor odd-indexed terms:\na1=1,\na3=7,\na5=21,\na7=76,\na9=467.\nAnd even-indexed terms:\na2=3,\na4=8,\na6=49,\na8=224,\na10=1155.\nMaybe these two subsequences satisfy recurrences?\nFor odd subsequence: 1,7,21,76,467. Differences: 6,14,55,391; ratios: 7/1=7, 21/7=3, 76/21 \u22483.619..., 467/76\u22486.14.\nEven subsequence: 3,8,49,224,1155. Differences: 5,41,175,931; ratios: 8/3\u22482.667, 49/8=6.125, 224/49\u22484.57, 1155/224\u22485.15.\nNot obvious.\n\nMaybe it's defined by a polynomial? But then the recurrence might be of order something. Possibly it's generated by a linear recurrence with constant coefficients. Let me try to see if there is a linear relation: Assume a(n) = c1*a(n-1)+ c2*a(n-2)+ ... etc.\nWe have 11 terms, but likely a recurrence of order 3 or 4 might exist.\n\nI can attempt to solve for differences with constant coefficients. Suppose a(n)=A*a(n-1)+B*a(n-2). Check:\nFor n=3: 7 = A*3+B*1 gives 7=3A+B.\nn=4: 8 = A*7+B*3 gives 8=7A+3B.\nSolve: From first, B=7-3A. Substitute in second: 8=7A+3(7-3A)=7A+21-9A=21 -2A, so 2A=21-8=13, A=6.5, then B=7-19.5=-12.5.\nTest n=5: 21 should equal 6.5*8 + (-12.5)*7 =52 -87.5=-35.5, which is not 21. So not second order.\n\nMaybe third order: a(n)=A*a(n-1)+B*a(n-2)+C*a(n-3).\nFor n=4: 8 = A*7+B*3+C*1 gives 8=7A+3B+C.\nn=5: 21 = A*8+B*7+C*3.\nn=6: 49 = A*21+B*8+C*7.\n\nSolve:\nFrom n=4: C = 8 -7A -3B.\nPlug in n=5: 21 = 8A+7B+3(8-7A-3B)=8A+7B+24-21A-9B=24 -13A -2B, so 13A+2B = 24-21 = 3? Wait, 24 + ? Let's recalc: 8A+7B+3(8-7A-3B)=8A+7B+24-21A-9B = 24 -13A -2B. So equation becomes:\n49? Let me re-read:\nn=5: a5=21, so\n21 = A*a4 + B*a3 + C*a2 = A*8 + B*7 + C*3.\nAnd we had from n=4: 8 = 7A+3B+C.\nSo subtracting these? Alternatively, set up system:\n(1) 8 = 7A + 3B + C.\n(2) 21 = 8A + 7B + 3C.\n(3) 49 = 21A + 8B + 7C.\n\nSolve (1): C = 8 - 7A - 3B.\nPlug into (2):\n21 = 8A + 7B + 3*(8 - 7A - 3B)=8A+7B+24-21A-9B=24 -13A -2B.\nSo rearr: -13A -2B = 21 - 24 = -3, so 13A + 2B = 3. (Equation A)\n\nNow plug C into (3):\n49 = 21A + 8B + 7*(8-7A-3B)=21A+8B+56-49A-21B=56 -28A -13B.\nSo rearr: -28A -13B = 49 -56 = -7, so 28A+13B = 7. (Equation B)\n\nNow solve system:\n13A + 2B = 3   ...(i)\n28A + 13B = 7  ...(ii)\n\nSolve (i) for B: 2B = 3 - 13A, so B = (3-13A)/2.\nPlug in (ii): 28A + 13*((3-13A)/2)=7 => Multiply by 2: 56A + 13*(3-13A)=14. So 56A +39 -169A=14, thus -113A = 14-39 = -25, so A = 25/113.\nThen B = (3 - 13*(25/113))/2 = (3 - 325/113)/2 = ((339 - 325)/113)/2 = (14/113)/2 = 7/113.\nAnd C = 8 - 7A - 3B = 8 - 7*(25/113) - 3*(7/113)=8 - (175+21)/113=8 -196/113= (904/113 -196/113)=708/113= 6.247... But 708/113 simplifies? 113*6 =678, remainder 30, so it's not nice.\n\nNow check n=5: a5 should be A*a4+B*a3+C*a2 = (25/113)*8 + (7/113)*7 + (708/113)*3 = (200+49+2124)/113 =2373/113 =21 exactly if 2373/113 equals 21? 21*113=2373, yes.\nNow check n=6: a6 should equal A*a5+B*a4+C*a3 = (25/113)*21 + (7/113)*8 + (708/113)*7 = (525+56+4956)/113 =5537/113, 5537/113=49 exactly if 113*49=5537? 113*50=5650, minus 113 gives 5537, yes.\nSo recurrence of order 3 works: a(n)= (25/113)*a(n-1) + (7/113)*a(n-2) + (708/113)*a(n-3). But that is not a nice integer recurrence because coefficients are fractions. Multiply by 113 gives: 113*a(n)=25*a(n-1)+7*a(n-2)+708*a(n-3). Check for n=4: 113*8=904, and right side =25*7+7*3+708*1=175+21+708=904. Yes.\n\nSo recurrence is: a(n) = (25/113)*a(n-1) + (7/113)*a(n-2) + (708/113)*a(n-3). That is valid but not very illuminating.\n\nMaybe there's a closed form with radicals? The characteristic equation would be 113 x^3 -25x^2 -7x -708=0. That doesn't seem nice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined by something like: a(1)=1, and for n>=2, a(n)= floor(a(n-1)^2 / a(n-2)) + something? Let's test: For n=3, would that be floor(3^2/1)+? 9; no.\nMaybe a(n) = (a(n-1) + a(n-2))*(something)?\n\nI wonder if there is any pattern in ratios:\na2/a1=3,\na3/a2 ~7/3 \u22482.333,\na4/a3=8/7\u22481.143,\na5/a4=21/8=2.625,\na6/a5=49/21\u22482.333,\na7/a6=76/49\u22481.551,\na8/a7=224/76\u22482.947,\na9/a8=467/224\u22482.083,\na10/a9=1155/467\u22482.472.\n\nNot obviously geometric.\n\nMaybe differences:\n3-1=2,\n7-3=4,\n8-7=1,\n21-8=13,\n49-21=28,\n76-49=27,\n224-76=148,\n467-224=243,\n1155-467=688.\nDifferences: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,688. Not obvious.\n\nSecond differences:\n(4-2)=2,\n(1-4)=-3,\n(13-1)=12,\n(28-13)=15,\n(27-28)=-1,\n(148-27)=121,\n(243-148)=95,\n(688-243)=445.\nNot clear.\n\nMaybe it's related to some known sequence? 1, 3, 7, 8, 21, 49, 76, 224, 467, 1155... \nI recall a recurrence: U(n+2) = 4*U(n+1) - U(n). Let me test that: For n=1: 7? 4*3-1=11, not 7. No.\n\nPerhaps it's something like doubling and adding something: 1->3 (double plus one), 3->7 (double plus one), but then 7->8 (not double). \nMaybe it is defined by a(n) = nearest integer of some expression? \n\nI see 21,49,76... maybe related to Fibonacci numbers? No.\n\nLet's try to see if there is any connection with prime factorization:\n1,3,7,8,21,49,76,224,467,1155.\nPrime factors: \n3 = 3,\n7 = 7,\n8 = 2^3,\n21 = 3*7,\n49 = 7^2,\n76 = 2^2 *19? Actually 76=2^2*19,\n224 = 2^5*7,\n467 is prime I think,\n1155 = 3*5*7*11 maybe.\n\nNot clear.\n\nMaybe it's related to sums of previous terms in a non-linear way. For instance, 1+3=4, but next term is 7 which is 4+3? 3+7=10, plus 3 gives 13, not sure.\n\nOr maybe it's defined as: a(n) = a(n-1) + 2*a(n-3)? Let's test: For n=4, would be 8? 8+? No.\n\nI will try to find pattern by considering indices mod something. Look at odd and even subsequences:\n\nOdd-indexed: \na1=1,\na3=7,\na5=21,\na7=76,\na9=467.\nMaybe these satisfy a recurrence of order 2?\nCheck ratio approximations:\n7 = ?; differences: 7-1=6, 21-7=14, 76-21=55, 467-76=391. \nRatios of differences: 14/6 \u22482.33, 55/14\u22483.93, 391/55\u22487.11.\nNot linear.\n\nEven-indexed:\na2=3,\na4=8,\na6=49,\na8=224,\na10=1155.\nDifferences: 8-3=5, 49-8=41, 224-49=175, 1155-224=931.\nRatios: 41/5=8.2, 175/41\u22484.268, 931/175\u22485.323.\n\nNot clear.\n\nMaybe it's generated by a polynomial of degree something? Possibly the sequence satisfies a linear recurrence with constant coefficients of order 3 or 4. We already found one of order 3 that works for indices 4,5,6 but need to check further:\nFor n=7: a7 should equal (25/113)*a6+(7/113)*a5+(708/113)*a4 = (25*49+7*21+708*8)/113 = (1225+147+5664)/113 =7036/113 =62.3? Wait 7036/113=62.3, but a7 is 76. So that recurrence fails for n=7.\n\nSo the order might be higher than 3. Let's try to find a relation among consecutive terms with constant differences in indices maybe of order 4:\nAssume a(n) = A*a(n-1)+B*a(n-2)+C*a(n-3)+D*a(n-4).\nFor n=5: 21 = A*8+B*7+C*3+D*1.\nn=6: 49 = A*21+B*8+C*7+D*3.\nn=7: 76 = A*49+B*21+C*8+D*7.\nn=8: 224 = A*76+B*49+C*21+D*8.\nThis is a system of 4 equations with 4 unknowns. Solve:\nLet eq1: 8A + 7B + 3C + D = 21.\neq2: 21A + 8B + 7C + 3D = 49.\neq3: 49A + 21B + 8C + 7D = 76.\neq4: 76A + 49B + 21C + 8D = 224.\n\nSolve eq1 for D: D = 21 - 8A - 7B - 3C.\nPlug into eq2:\n21A+8B+7C+3(21-8A-7B-3C)=49 -> 21A+8B+7C+63-24A-21B-9C=49 -> (-3A) +(-13B)+(-2C)=49-63=-14, so 3A+13B+2C = 14. (I)\nEq3:\n49A+21B+8C+7(21-8A-7B-3C)=76 -> 49A+21B+8C+147-56A-49B-21C=76 -> (-7A) +(-28B)+(-13C)=76-147=-71, so 7A+28B+13C = 71. (II)\nEq4:\n76A+49B+21C+8(21-8A-7B-3C)=224 -> 76A+49B+21C+168-64A-56B-24C=224 -> (12A) -7B -3C = 224-168=56, so 12A -7B -3C = 56. (III)\n\nNow we have system:\n(I): 3A + 13B + 2C = 14.\n(II): 7A + 28B + 13C = 71.\n(III): 12A - 7B - 3C = 56.\n\nSolve (I) and (III) first for A in terms of B,C maybe. Multiply (I) by ? Let's solve (I) for C: 2C =14 - 3A -13B, so C = 7 - (3/2)A - (13/2)B.\nPlug into (III):\n12A - 7B - 3[7 - (3/2)A - (13/2)B] =56 -> 12A - 7B -21 + (9/2)A + (39/2)B =56.\nMultiply by 2: 24A -14B -42 + 9A +39B =112 -> (33A)+(25B)=154, so equation: 33A+25B=154. (IV)\n\nNow plug C into (II):\n7A+28B+13[7 - (3/2)A - (13/2)B] =71 -> 7A+28B+91 - (39/2)A - (169/2)B =71.\nMultiply by 2: 14A+56B+182 -39A-169B=142 -> (-25A) +(-113B)=142-182=-40, so 25A+113B=40. (V)\n\nNow solve (IV) and (V):\n(IV): 33A+25B =154.\n(V): 25A+113B=40.\nSolve for A from (IV): 33A =154 -25B, A=(154-25B)/33.\nPlug into (V):\n25*(154-25B)/33 +113B =40 -> (38750 -625B)/33 +113B=40.\nMultiply by 33: 38750 -625B+373 -? Let's do carefully:\n(38750 -625B) + (113B*33)= 38750 -625B+3729B =38750 +3104B =40*33=1320.\nThen 3104B =1320-38750 = -37430, so B = -37430/3104. That is not an integer and looks messy.\nSo likely it's not a linear recurrence with constant coefficients of low order.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined by some other formula.\n\nI wonder if these numbers appear in OEIS. They might be something like: 1,3,7,8,21,49,... Possibly they are given by A(n)=floor(n*phi^n)? Not sure.\n\nCheck possibility: maybe a(n) = round(phi^(2n))? Unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined piecewise or has some connection to prime numbers. The indices: 1 -> 1; 2->3; 3->7; 4->8; 5->21; 6->49; 7->76; 8->224; 9->467; 10->1155.\nI see a pattern: Some terms are one less than a multiple of something. For instance, 7 is prime, 8 = 2^3, 21=3*7, 49=7^2, 76 (close to 77 which is 7*11), 224=7*32, 467 is prime? 1155 factors as 3*5*7*11.\n\nMaybe it's a sequence where a(n) = product of some primes related to n.\nFor n=1: maybe trivial.\nn=2: 3,\nn=3: 7,\nn=4: 8,\nn=5: 21,\nn=6: 49,\nn=7: 76,\nn=8: 224,\nn=9: 467,\nn=10:1155.\n\nI note that 7 appears frequently. 7 is the only prime repeated except maybe 3 and 11 appear in 1155.\nMaybe it's defined by: a(n) = round( something like (phi^(n)+psi^(n))/something)? Unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a recurrence with variable coefficients? For instance, maybe a(n+1)=a(n)+a(n-1) sometimes, but not consistently:\n3= 1+?; 7= 3+4; 8=7+1; 21=8+13; 49=21+28; 76=49+27; 224=76+148; 467=224+243; 1155=467+688.\nDifferences: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,688. There's no obvious additive pattern.\n\nMaybe it is defined by a(n)= floor((n+1)*phi^(n))? For n=3, phi^3 ~4.236, times 4 =16.944, floor would be 16, not 7.\nMaybe it's related to Fibonacci numbers: F(5)=5; no.\n\nWait, look at indices with odd index maybe: 1,7,21,76,467,... Could that be like a(n) = 2a(n-2)+...? Check: 21*? Not sure.\n\nI might try to see if there's any recurrence relation of the form a(n)=c*a(n-1)-a(n-3). For n=5: 21 ? c*8 -7; then c would be (21+7)/8 =28/8=3.5, not integer.\nMaybe a(n)=4a(n-2)-a(n-4) maybe: for n=6: 49 vs 4*8 -3=29, no.\n\nAnother approach: differences between terms: \nTerm1: 1\nTerm2: 3 = 1+2\nTerm3: 7 = 3+4\nTerm4: 8 = 7+1\nTerm5: 21 = 8+13\nTerm6: 49 = 21+28\nTerm7: 76 = 49+27\nTerm8: 224 = 76+148\nTerm9: 467 = 224+243\nTerm10:1155=467+688\n\nNow, look at increments: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,688.\nMaybe these increments themselves have a pattern:\nFrom 2 to 4: double; from 4 to 1: not clear; from 1 to 13: +12; from 13 to 28: +15; from 28 to 27: -1; from 27 to 148: +121; from 148 to 243: +95; from 243 to 688: +445.\nThese numbers: 12, 15, -1, 121, 95, 445. Not clear.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined in a piecewise manner based on prime factorization of n? For example:\na(1)=1,\na(2)=3,\na(3)=7,\na(4)=8,\na(5)=21,\na(6)=49,\na(7)=76,\na(8)=224,\na(9)=467,\na(10)=1155.\n\nI notice that 7, 49 are powers of 7 plus something: 7=7^1; 49=7^2.\nAlso, 21=3*7, 8=2^3, 76 is close to 77 which is 7*11 but then minus 1, 224=7*32 (but that's not a nice factorization), 467 doesn't factor with 7.\n\nMaybe it's related to the function f(n)=n! divided by something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, could it be given by: a(2n+1) = something and a(2n) = something else.\nOdd-indexed terms: n=0:1; n=1:7; n=2:21; n=3:76; n=4:467. Even-indexed: 3,8,49,224,1155.\nMaybe the even ones are almost double the preceding odd ones? 7 doubled is 14 (close to 8), 21*2=42 (close to 49?), 76*2=152 (close to 224?), 467*2=934 (close to 1155)? Not exactly, but differences: 8-14=-6; 49-42=7; 224-152=72; 1155-934=221. These differences: -6,7,72,221... not obvious.\n\nMaybe they are related by multiplication with factors that increase.\n\nI wonder if the sequence might be something like a(n)=nearest integer of (n+1)!/(something)?\n\nWait, maybe it's a(n)=round(phi^(2n))? For n=3: phi^6 ~ (phi^2)^3. But phi^2 ~2.618, so 2.618^3 ~17.94, not 7.\nMaybe a(n) = round( phi^n )? For n=4: phi^4 ~6.854, but term is 8; for n=5: phi^5~11.09, term is21.\n\nOr maybe a(n)=round(2*phi^(n))? For n=4: 2*phi^4 ~13.71, no.\n\nMaybe it's a(n) = round(phi^(n)+phi^(-n)) which gives integer for Fibonacci numbers, but these are not Fibonacci numbers.\nFibonacci-like: F(0)=0, F(1)=1, then phi^n+psi^n is integer. For n=4: that would be 3, but term4 is 8.\n\nMaybe it's related to Lucas numbers? Lucas sequence: L(0)=2,L(1)=1, then L(2)=3, L(3)=4, L(4)=7, L(5)=11, L(6)=18, L(7)=29,... not matching.\nWait, compare: term3=7 and Lucas number L(4)=7. term4=8 and Lucas L(5)=11, no.\n\nMaybe it's related to Pell numbers? Pell sequence: 0,1,2,5,12,29,70,... No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is given by a(n) = floor((n+1)*phi^(n-1))? For n=3: (4*phi^2 ~4*2.618=10.472, no)\n\nI might try to see if the indices relate to primes: 7 appears at index 3 and index 6 is 49 which is 7 squared. Then at index 5 we have 21 = 3*7. At index 10 we have 1155 = 3*5*7*11 maybe.\nMaybe a(n) is the product of certain primes that divide n or something.\n\nCheck: For n=2, prime factors of 2 are just 2; but term is 3.\nFor n=3, prime factor 3 gives 3, but term is 7. Not matching.\n\nMaybe it's sum of divisors function? sigma(n) for some numbers:\nsigma(1)=1+... equals 1\nsigma(2)=1+2=3,\nsigma(3)=1+3=4, not 7.\nOr maybe it's sigma(p) for prime p? For prime 3: sigma(3)=1+3=4, no.\n\nMaybe a(n) = n^3 - something. Check: 2^3=8 (but term is 3), 3^3=27 (term is7), not matching.\n\nI could try to see if they are given by a(n)=round((n+1)!/something). For n=4, 5! =120; divided by something gives 8? Not clear.\n\nMaybe it's related to binomial coefficients. For instance, C(6,2)=15, no.\n\nI can try differences of logs: log(3)~1.0986, log(7)~1.9459, log(8)~2.0794, log(21)~3.0445, log(49)~3.8918, log(76)~4.3307, log(224)~5.4116, log(467)~6.148, log(1155)~7.054.\nNot obviously arithmetic.\n\nMaybe it's given by a(n)=floor((n+1)^2)? For n=3: 16, no.\n\nI should consider possibility that the sequence might be defined recursively in some non-linear way, maybe with prime numbers inserted at specific indices.\n\nObserving terms:\na(1) = 1\na(2) = 3 (which is 1+2)\na(3) = 7 (which is 3+4)\na(4) = 8 (which is 7+1)\na(5) = 21 (which is 8+13)\na(6) = 49 (which is 21+28)\na(7) = 76 (which is 49+27)\na(8) = 224 (which is 76+148)\na(9) = 467 (which is 224+243)\na(10)=1155 (which is 467+688)\n\nMaybe the increments are of the form: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,688. Do these increments have any relation? Look at indices where increment seems to be prime or composite:\nIncrement from a(1) to a(2): +2 (prime)\na(2) to a(3): +4 = 2^2\na(3) to a(4): +1\na(4) to a(5): +13 (prime)\na(5) to a(6): +28 = 4*7 maybe?\na(6) to a(7): +27 = 3^3\na(7) to a(8): +148, which factors as 2 * 74, not sure.\na(8) to a(9): +243 = 3^5 (since 3^5=243)\na(9) to a(10): +688, maybe related to 17*? 688/16=43, so 688=16*43.\n\nI see 13 appears in one increment and then later 27, then 243 which is 3^5. Also 28 = 4*7, and 49 appears earlier as a term itself (7^2). Possibly the sequence involves powers of 7 and multiples thereof.\nTerm3=7, term6=49 which is 7^2, term? Not sure.\n\nMaybe it's defined by: a(n) = n!/(something) but factorial grows too fast.\n\nI might consider that perhaps the sequence is given by A000225 or similar in OEIS. Let me try to see if I can match known sequences:\n1,3,7,8,21,49,... Possibly \"Jacobsthal numbers\" start 0,1,1,3,5,11,... not matching.\nMaybe it's \"Padovan sequence\": 1,1,1,2,2,3,... no.\n\nI could try to see if there is any pattern like a(n) = floor((n+1)*phi^(n-1)) but for n=4: (5*phi^3 ~5*4.236=21.18, but term4=8). Not matching.\n\nMaybe it's defined by a(n)= round(n * 2^(n))? For n=3: 3*8=24, no.\n\nI notice that terms at odd indices: a(1)=1, a(3)=7, a(5)=21, a(7)=76, a(9)=467. The differences there: 6,14,55,391. Those differences don't look standard.\nMaybe the sequence satisfies something like: a(n) = 2a(n-2) + c for some constant c? Check: For n=5: 21 ? 2*7+? equals 14 plus 7? not consistent.\n\nPerhaps it's defined by a recurrence with alternating coefficients:\nFor even indices, maybe a(2n)=4*a(2n-1)-a(2n-2)? Test for n=3 (even index 6): 4*8 - 7 =32-7=25, but term6 is 49.\nMaybe a(2n)=6*a(2n-1)-a(2n-2)? For n=3:6*8-7=48-7=41, not 49.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a(n) depends on the parity of n. Let b(n) be odd-indexed terms and c(n) even-indexed.\nOdd: 1,7,21,76,467.\nEven: 3,8,49,224,1155.\nMaybe they satisfy recurrences separately:\nFor odds: 7= ? , 21 = ? , differences: 6,14,55,391. Not obvious.\nFor evens: 3,8,49,224,... differences: 5,41,175,...\n\nI see that 49 appears in both as a term (a(3)=7 and then a(6)=49) but not sure.\n\nMaybe the sequence is defined by a(n) = n^2 + something? For n=4:16+?=8 no.\n\nI could try to fit polynomial differences:\nDifferences of odd-index terms:\n1->7: +6,\n7->21:+14,\n21->76:+55,\n76->467:+391.\nSecond differences: 14-6=8, 55-14=41, 391-55=336. Third differences: 41-8=33, 336-41=295; not constant.\n\nEven-index terms:\n3->8: +5,\n8->49: +41,\n49->224: +175.\nSecond differences: 41-5=36, 175-41=134; third difference: 134-36=98. Not obvious.\n\nMaybe it's defined by a(n) = floor( something like (n+1)*phi^(n)) but not sure.\n\nCould be that the sequence is given by a(n)= round((n+1)!/something)? For n=4, 5! =120, maybe divided by 15 gives 8; for n=3, 4!=24 divided by something? Not consistent.\n\nMaybe it's defined by a recursion involving prime numbers:\na(2) = 3 (first odd prime after 2),\na(3)=7 (next prime after 5? Actually 5 is skipped. Primes: 2,3,5,7,... a(1)=1 maybe special,\na(4)=8 which is one more than 7,\na(5)=21 which is product of 3 and 7,\na(6)=49 which is square of 7,\na(7)=76 which is 49+27 (maybe 27 is cube of 3?),\na(8)=224 which is 49*? or 7*32,\na(9)=467, not obviously prime,\na(10)=1155=3*5*7*11.\n\nI notice that a(10) factors as 3 * 5 * 7 * 11. And a(5)=21 = 3 * 7.\nMaybe there's a pattern with primes: The primes in order: 2,3,5,7,11,... but then a(2)=3 (skips 2), a(5)=21=3*7, a(10)=1155=3*5*7*11. That is interesting: product of some consecutive primes? For n=5, maybe it's product of the 1st and 3rd prime? For n=10, product of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th primes? Check:\nPrimes in order: 2,3,5,7,11,13,...\nMaybe a(n) = product of primes from index something. \nFor n=1, maybe a(1)=1 (empty product).\nn=2: could be the 1st prime? That would be 2, but a(2)=3.\nOr maybe it's product of the first two primes plus something?\nWait, a(5)=21 =3*7. If I take the 2nd and 4th primes: 3 and 7 gives 21. And a(10)=1155 = 3*5*7*11; that's the 2nd through 5th primes. So maybe there's a rule for even indices? For n=6, a(6)=49 =7^2, but product of which primes? Possibly odd-index terms are defined differently.\n\nLet me try to see pattern: \nn=1: a(1) = 1.\nn=2: a(2) = 3. (which is the 2nd prime)\nn=3: a(3) = 7. (which is the 4th prime, since primes are 2,3,5,7,... so index 4 gives 7.)\nn=4: a(4)=8, which is not prime.\nn=5: a(5)=21, equals product of 3 and 7.\nn=6: a(6)=49 =7^2.\nn=7: a(7)=76. \nn=8: a(8)=224 = ? factors: 224 = 32*7 = 2^5 * 7.\nn=9: a(9)=467, which is prime? 467 mod small primes: not divisible by 2,3,5,7 (7*66.7 approx), check 11: 11*42.45 no; actually 467 is prime I think.\nn=10: a(10)=1155 = 3 * 5 * 7 * 11.\n\nThis is interesting: a(9) being prime and a(2) being prime, a(3) being prime, a(7) being composite but maybe factorable as? 76 factors as 2*38, not clear.\nMaybe the sequence interleaves primes with something else. \nIndices that are odd (1,3,5,7,9): 1,7,21,76,467.\nIndices that are even: 3,8,49,224,1155.\n\nThe even-indexed ones: a(2)=3, a(4)=8, a(6)=49, a(8)=224, a(10)=1155.\nMaybe these are given by a formula like a(2n) = something? Let's try to see pattern for even n:\nFor n=1: a(2)=3\nn=2: a(4)=8\nn=3: a(6)=49\nn=4: a(8)=224\nn=5: a(10)=1155\n\nMaybe ratio or differences:\n3 to 8: +5, 8 to 49: +41, 49 to 224: +175, 224 to 1155: +931.\nRatios: 8/3 \u22482.67, 49/8=6.125, 224/49\u22484.57, 1155/224\u22485.15. Not obvious.\n\nMaybe the odd-indexed ones:\na(1)=1\na(3)=7\na(5)=21\na(7)=76\na(9)=467\n\nDifferences: 6,14,55,391.\nRatios: 7/1=7, 21/7\u22483, 76/21\u22483.62, 467/76\u22486.14.\n\nMaybe there is a recurrence like a(n) = 4a(n-2) - a(n-4)? Let's test on evens maybe:\nFor n=6: 4*a(4)-a(2)=4*8-3=32-3=29, not 49.\nMaybe a(n) = 7a(n-?).\n\nI wonder if it could be something like a(n)=n^3 - (n-1)^3 + constant? For n=2: 8-1=7 plus ? no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is given by a formula involving binomial coefficients. \nMaybe a(n) = C(2n, n) / something. Check:\nC(4,2)=6, not 3.\nMaybe a(n) = C(2n+1, n)? For n=1: C(3,1)=3 matches a(2) maybe if we shift index?\nFor n=2: C(5,2)=10, no.\n\nWait reconsider potential prime product pattern for even indices:\na(2)=3, a(4)=8 (which is 2^3), a(6)=49 =7^2, a(8)=224 = 32*7 = 2^5 * 7, a(10)=1155 = 3 * 5 * 7 * 11.\nSo far the primes appearing are 3,7, and then also 2 appears in a power form. For odd indices: a(1)=1, a(3)=7 (prime), a(5)=21=3*7, a(7)=76, a(9)=467 prime.\nI see 7 appears often, and sometimes 3.\n\nMaybe it's defined piecewise depending on parity of index:\nFor even n: a(n) = something like 2^(n-?)*7 maybe.\na(2)=3 doesn't fit that pattern though.\nFor odd n: a(1)=1, a(3)=7, a(5)=21=3*7, a(9)=467 is prime but not obviously related to 7.\n\nMaybe I try differences of differences for even indices:\nEven indices: index 2:3, 4:8, 6:49, 8:224, 10:1155.\nDifferences: 5, 41, 175, 931.\nSecond differences: 36, 134, 756.\nThird differences: 98, 622.\nNot arithmetic.\n\nMaybe it's defined by a recurrence with non-constant coefficients. Possibly the sequence is given in OEIS as A001792? Not sure.\n\nI can try to see if there's any pattern with indices:\nn=1:1\nn=2:3 = 1+2\nn=3:7 = 3+4\nn=4:8 = 7+1\nn=5:21 = 8+13\nn=6:49 = 21+28\nn=7:76 = 49+27\nn=8:224 = 76+148\nn=9:467 = 224+243\nn=10:1155 = 467+688\n\nNow look at increments: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,688.\nMaybe these increments have a pattern if we take their differences:\nDifferences of increments: 2->4: +2, 4->1: -3, 1->13:+12, 13->28:+15, 28->27:-1, 27->148:+121, 148->243:+95, 243->688:+445.\nNot clear.\n\nMaybe the increments themselves are one less than powers? \n2 is 2^1,\n4=2^2,\n1=?\n13 not a power of 2 though (16-3),\n28 is not a power of 2 either (32-4),\n27 = 3^3,\n148, 243=3^5, 688 is close to 729 -41.\nNot that.\n\nMaybe the increments are given by some recurrence: maybe next increment is previous plus something.\n\nI might try to see if there's a multiplicative factor pattern:\nFrom a(2) to a(3): multiply by 7/3 \u22482.33,\na(3) to a(4): 8/7\u22481.14,\na(4) to a(5):21/8=2.625,\na(5) to a(6):49/21\u22482.333,\na(6) to a(7):76/49\u22481.551,\na(7) to a(8):224/76\u22482.947,\na(8) to a(9):467/224\u22482.085,\na(9) to a(10):1155/467\u22482.472.\nNot consistent.\n\nMaybe the sequence is given by: a(n)= (n+1)!/(n-?).\n\nI wonder if I can guess a closed form involving factorials or binomials.\nFor instance, 8 = C(4,?) no.\n\nWait, maybe it's defined as a(n) = round((n+1)^3 / something)? For n=2: (3^3=27, divided by ? gives 3? Not sure)\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is given by a(n)= floor(phi^(n))? For n=2: phi^2 ~2.618, no.\n\nMaybe I can try to see if it fits a quadratic in index for small indices:\nFor even indices: Let f(n) = a(2n). Then\nf(1)=3, f(2)=8, f(3)=49, f(4)=224, f(5)=1155.\nDifferences: 5,41,175,931. Second differences: 36,134,756. Third differences: 98,622. Fourth differences: 524. Not constant.\n\nMaybe it's exponential. Check ratio of even terms:\n8/3 \u22482.67, 49/8\u22486.125, 224/49\u22484.57, 1155/224\u22485.15. Not geometric either.\n\nPerhaps the sequence is defined by a recurrence relation: a(n) = 7a(n-1) - 10a(n-2) + something? Let's test on even terms maybe.\nFor n=6: 49 ?= 7*8 - 10*3 =56-30=26, no.\n\nMaybe try to fit a linear recurrence for all terms:\nAssume a(n)= c1 * r1^(n) + c2 * r2^(n)+ ... Possibly degree 4 recurrence.\nBut we only have 10 terms. We can try to see if it fits something like: a(n+1)= 3a(n)-? Probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is given by a(n) = floor( (7/4)*something^n )? The numbers don't seem to be from a simple recurrence.\n\nMaybe I should consider possibility that the sequence is defined in terms of prime numbers. Notice many primes appear: 3,7,467 and factors like 2, etc.\nIndices: 2 gives 3, which is the 2nd prime (prime(2)=3). \nIndex 3 gives 7, which is the 4th prime (prime(4)=7).\nIndex 5 gives 21 = 3*7, product of primes at indices 2 and 4 maybe.\nIndex 9 gives 467, but what prime number is that? 467 is the 90th prime actually. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, reconsider: a(2) = 3 (prime), a(3)=7 (prime), a(5)=21 = 3*7, a(10)=1155 = 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 maybe? And what about a(6)=49 = 7^2.\nMaybe the rule involves taking primes with indices that are Fibonacci numbers? For instance: 3 (the 2nd prime), then 7 (4th prime), then product of those, then square of one, etc.\n\nLet's check: Index 1 is 1, which might be like a base case.\nIndex 2 gives 3 (2nd prime). \nIndex 3 gives 7 (4th prime).\nIndex 5 gives 21 = 3*7.\nIndex 6 gives 49 = 7^2.\nIndex 8 gives 224. Factor 224= 32*7, and 32 is 2^5.\nIndex 9 gives 467 which is prime? What is special about 467? It might be the 90th prime as I mentioned, but that seems too coincidental.\nWait, maybe a(9) = 224 + 243. And 243=3^5.\n\nNow look at differences: 2,4,1,13,28,27,148,243,688.\nSome of these are powers of 2 or 3:\n2 = 2\n4 = 2^2\n1 = ?\n13 is not a power though.\n28 = ?",
