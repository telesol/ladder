# TASK: Compute m[71] Constraints Given d[71]=1

## Context
We have predicted d[71] = 1 with 60% confidence.
Now we need to narrow down m[71].

## Key Equations
k[n] = 2*k[n-1] + adj[n]
adj[n] = 2^n - m[n]*k[d[n]]
m[n] = (2^n - adj[n]) / k[d[n]]

## If d[71] = 1, then k[d[71]] = k[1] = 1

This simplifies to:
m[71] = 2^71 - adj[71]
     = 2^71 - (k[71] - 2*k[70])

## Known Values
k[70] = 970,436,974,005,023,690,481
2^71 = 2,361,183,241,434,822,606,848
2*k[70] = 1,940,873,948,010,047,380,962

## k[71] Range
k[71] ∈ [2^70, 2^71 - 1]
     = [1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424 , 2,361,183,241,434,822,606,847]

## m[71] Range (if d=1)
m[71] = 2^71 - k[71] + 2*k[70]
     = 2,361,183,241,434,822,606,848 - k[71] + 1,940,873,948,010,047,380,962
     = 4,302,057,189,444,869,987,810 - k[71]

When k[71] = 2^70 (minimum):
  m[71] = 4,302,057,189,444,869,987,810 - 1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424
       = 3,121,465,568,727,458,684,386

When k[71] = 2^71 - 1 (maximum):
  m[71] = 4,302,057,189,444,869,987,810 - 2,361,183,241,434,822,606,847
       = 1,940,873,948,010,047,380,963

So: m[71] ∈ [1.94×10^21, 3.12×10^21]

## Your Task

### 1. Find patterns in m-sequence for large n (d=1 cases)
For n=55 to n=70, when d[n]=1:
- What patterns exist in m[n]?
- Is there a formula?

### 2. Check if m[71] has constraints from:
- Divisibility by building blocks (22, 19, 50, 23)
- Self-index pattern (71 is prime, so m[71] = 71 × Q?)
- Ratio patterns (m[n]/2^n ≈ constant?)

### 3. m-sequence for high n (d=1 cases)
m[55] = 25,932,517,016,087,922 (d=1)
m[57] = 4,490,804,816,683,930 (d=1)
m[58] = 121,581,741,999,021,493 (d=1)
m[59] = 36,389,108,247,693 (d=1)
m[61] = 1,050,046,055,678,011,578 (d=1)
m[62] = 251,108,012,730,583,649 (d=1)
m[64] = 3,396,888,886,656,216,929 (d=1)
m[65] = 6,089,684,316,696,331,318 (d=2, skip)
m[67] = 34,889,908,137,426,753,598 (d=1)
m[69] = 34,896,088,136,426,753,598 (d=1)

### 4. Look for m[71] prediction
Given the patterns, what is the most likely value of m[71]?

## Expected Output
1. Narrowed range for m[71]
2. Any divisibility constraints
3. Best prediction for m[71] (if possible)
